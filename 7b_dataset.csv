ReviewContent
"Good. It IS a page turner. You can read this book in one day, two at the most, and the plot drives the whole book. The unreliable narrators (there are two besides the main character) are as unlikable as they are unreliable, and there isn't a nice male in the book. Entirely plot driven; the characters are paper thin. You can figure out who-dunnit by the middle of the book. The ending is weak. I can't imagine what all the fuss is about, except that it is quick and there are lots of twists and turns, and you can't trust anyone to tell the truth."
"There are no words for how much I loathed this book.  This was the first audiobook I ever listened to so not sure if something was lost in translation here, if I just disliked the narrators, or if it is truly the book I hated - but man oh man I hated this book and have no idea what the hype is about.  Maybe if I READ it I would have liked it better but none of the characters were likable, the narration was rote and emotionless, and the writing was so ... basic.  ""I sat on the bed.  I got off the bed.  I sat back on the bed.  I poured myself another drink,  I don't want to drink.  I can't stop myself.  I'm going to drink.""  Not a direct quote from the book but you get the picture.  I thought it went way longer than necessary.  I honestly can't figure out why everyone was in love with this book."
"I think I would ordinarily cut this book more of a break because it is fast-paced - Hawkins wastes zero time describing anything that doesn't have to do with exactly what is going on in the moment - and while that doesn't make her a great writer, there is absolutely nothing here that will transcend, or reverberate within you long after you've finished reading - it at least doesn't bog you down with preciousness. But because the book has received so many rave reviews - I have to judge it more harshly because it just isn't deserved. This is serviceable writing at best - about the level you'd read on Fiction Press - about the level you would get from a first year MFA student. If someone is digging around in something, they are 'scrabbling' (over and over). The lead character's blackouts are along the lines of: ""I couldn't remember. It was all dark. All black. All cloudy. Couldn't remember."" I'm making that up, but it's not significantly different. So, that's the writing, let's get to the plot.The book is told from the POV of three different female characters, none of them compelling in the slightest. We're supposed to care deeply that a woman who chronically cheats on her husband disappears. I really didn't care that she did, frankly. Then we're supposed to care that Rachel, who drinks too much on the train while she pretends to commute to a job she doesn't have and obsesses about her ex-husband and her 'barren womb', may or may not have witnessed a crime. I didn't care about Rachel, didn't care about the woman who'd gone MIA. Now let's get to the third character you can't care about - Anna. I don't even remember her place in the story I cared about her so little. Oh, right, she's the woman who is responsible for the breakdown of Rachel's marriage and is now married to Rachel's ex, Tom.As others have noted, the three female characters have little to discern them from each other, and speak in a nearly identical voice - except one of them drinks. All three lament about men - constantly. They seem to have no other life interests - not one has a hobby, a job, or anything compelling her forward from day to day that doesn't have to do with a guy. (The guys all turn out to be jerks.)I suppose people like this do exist, I'm just not sure why I'm supposed to care about them - or why anyone else did, or how this book got to be so popular. I've heard it was compared to Gone Girl but other than both having a missing woman at the core, and 'Girl' in the title, there seems to be no comparison whatsoever.The 'twist' isn't a twist in the slightest, just the reveal of the missing woman's murderer, and it's exactly who, about three-fourths of the way through (and I'm not good at guessing twists), you suspect it is.  Then the 'reveal' is the guy confessing he did it in a speech you'd hear some cartoonish villain give in a super hero movie or soap opera. That kind of 'Bwahahaha I did it!' thing. Very convenient.But I guess the biggest thing that bothered me was that the entire crux of the story is based on the idea that Rachel has an alcoholic blackout - and the author explains (twice) that when you are having an alcoholic blackout, your brain does not create memories - so there is nothing to 'remember'- but then lo and behold she suddenly has a memory breakthrough, and solves the crime. I thought she wouldn't have been creating memories? It's as if the author wrote half her book, then decided to do some research (googling) and when she found research that blatantly contradicted the plot point her book hinges on, decided ""Oh, what the heck, I'll keep writing"" and then decided to INCLUDE her research. And her editor didn't notice or (more likely) didn't care.A couple of other things an editor (if this book had one) should have picked up on: Much is made of a pile of clothes by the train tracks - so much so that the book opens with a description of them - the importance of the clothes? None. Zip. Zero. And there's a red haired man who keeps popping up - muttering esoteric things - we assume he will be integral to the mystery. Nope, he just disappears.Other stuff I could complain about but it would be spoilery. It seems if books are bought by book clubs, they become huge sellers, no matter how evisceratingly terrible (witness 50 Shades of Grey).Here's one thing I admire the author for: She wrote this book in four months (it shows) and it became a HUGE bestseller. Awesome for her. So few authors ever make it to that level - even with stunningly well-written books - so kudos to her for whatever alchemy happened to guarantee she's got some money to retire on."
"Three disjointed characters for whom it's hard to feel sympathy or empathy as they are presented in such a superficial way you can't feel for any of them.Plot dragged on and ending was very unsubstantial - definitely not worth the ""Gone Girl"" comparisons."
"Was snookered into this novel as it was compared to Gone Girl, which I liked a lot...This one is filled with dysfunctional characters who you wouldn't care to spend any time with in real life...I figured out who ""done it"" early on and by the end I imagined an alternative ending which was not a happy ending for the whole lot of them...Can't believe it remains on the bestseller list!"
"I'm an editor by trade, so I found the numerous run-ons a bit distracting. I also had trouble keeping track of the story when the chapters jumped back-and-forth in time; it's very easy (and a bit disorienting) to end up halfway through a chapter before realizing that scene isn't a continuation of the previous chapter, but a completely different incident taking place in the past. Girl on the Train also left too many loose ends for my liking: for example, who is the red-haired man and why was he so important to include into the story if he doesn't do anything other than show up at inopportune times and (sort of) hit on the main character?I have to wonder if the author has personal experience with alcoholism, because the way she depicted the main character's thought process was very much in line with what I've seen from recovering addicts. That part is very effectively written; at the same time, it does make the main character harder to relate to, especially if you've never experienced it.Overall, it's not a terrible book, but I don't get the hype over it. As my book club friend described it, Girl on the Train is an airplane book: fine for killing a couple hours when you're traveling and have nothing better to do."
"This was the most boring book I have ever read. According to my Kindle I managed 32% before I gave up. The character was lifeless, the story was lifeless and just meandered along at a snails pace. The premise was totally unbelievable unless the train moved at the same speed as the snail. No dialogue just endless narrative of something. Completely unreadable."
"I have to admit a prejudice: I don't like to read books where I cannot identify even one character that I like.  That is the case with this book.  All the characters are narcissistic stereotypes. That the characters are well drawn and the story well structured is all the more reason for my dislike.  I had a hard time distinguishing the difference between the two male protagonists and the three females except that the main character Rachel is less attractive and a drunk.  Of course she wasn't always that way, at one time she was...just like the other two.  The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that the writing is done well.  I don't know if it is just my bias but I seldom find that books that are immensely popular hold up well when read."
"Hmmmm, after everything I read and heard about this book, I expected to be unable to put it down. Sadly, I was only too happy to put it down -- if I could send it back and get a refund, I surely would!This is a story about a drunk and a hyper-sexed suburban housewife. First, a reader cannot really care about any of the sad and sick characters in the book; second, there is no suspense -- you know the plot line and conclusion within the first 100 pages; and third, a reader  has only one thing to sustain himself -- how long will it take the drunk to remember? It is a pointless story with prosaic prose (not a single highlighted sentence in my copy!) and paper-thin characters. II cannot think of a single redeeming quality about this book except that it did not go on any longer. Had it ended in the first 25 pages, I would have been grateful to the author for putting me out of my misery associated with buying this book!!Unless you are hankering to be bored or fall into a deep slumber while reading this book, do not buy or read it."
"I have heard this book compared to Gone Girl because of the unreliable narrator device. Fans of Gone Girl generally, do not like the comparison, however, I feel that it was apt. Both of the books were long slogs about characters that I did not care about at all. In order for me to enjoy a book, there must be at least one character in the book that I like. The story was not that compelling. The characters were whiny or self-serving. The pacing was glacial.I would never have picked up this book on my own after my experience of reading Gone Girl except it was a selection of my book club. Any book that is compared to Gone Girl will be a book that I will strike from my list of possible reads. Girl on a Train also has one of the worst covers that I have ever seen. The lettering on the cover is probably very effective in trying to give a feeling of motion because it gives me motion sickness every time I look at it.This book was not an enjoyable read for me. I don't like unreliable narrators. I don't like books filled with unsympathetic characters. I don't like books that flip back and forth with time. I cannot recommend this book to anyone unless you enjoy the things that I don't."

I am half way through this book and can honestly say I hate it. I can't believe all of the good reviews--I don't understand what all the fuss is about. The character development is weak--and I don't like any of them. It's B-O-R-I-N-G. I would advise you to skip this book and save your money...but obviously some other people like this book. I just don't know why!!!

"I have just started reading e-books and thought I'd try this since I had a bus ride to take and the other book I am reading is 4 inches thick. I don't like books with prologue sections that try to hook you and leave you waiting half the book -- or more -- to find out what that was all about, but this one was brief, so onward.  I think I read the whole first chapter before starting to flick quickly through the screen pages:  Boring, flat, self-pitying, boring, paralyzed, nothing happening, how many pages devoted to Rachel's drinking and phone calls?, boring. . . .Anna, who cares?. . . Jess who is not Jess. . .Eesh. I gave up. The tone is very flat, even when the narrating character changes. I found myself wondering if this was indeed a mystery. Amazon has just informed me that it is. . . but the only mystery to me is why this book has been so successful."
"I was not expecting more than a ""beach book read"" but this was really bad.  It amazes me what ends up on the NYT bestseller list and book club selections.  To be in either catagory would suggest a minium amount of competency.  Out of sheer stuborness I stuck with it to see if it would improve but it just kept getting worse.  The ending was so awful, worse than the rest of the book, if that is at all possible.Totally confirmed my opinion that this is a little stinker of a book.  Not worth your time or money.P.S.  Some reviewers seem to have misread the NYT review.  They actually gave it a very bad review but I thought for $6.99 I would give it a try!"
"If you're wondering what the international ruckus is about this book, don't. I regret having squandered precious time on this overrated bestseller. The novel is simplistically written, predictably plotted, and littered with self-obsessed, uninteresting characters."
"I don't understand the hype around this book. I can't finish it, let alone recommend it. I've forced myself to read half of it, but have given up -  it's just too annoying. It is well-written from a technical standpoint, but just drags along, with the narrator droning on about her failed marriage, drinking problem and depression. I wouldn't want to put up with her in real life, so I certainly don't want to waste time reading about a fictional character like this. Maybe she shakes it off in the end, but I don't care enough to find out."
"I am surprised this has been on the best seller list for so long.  I have read many better  written books over the years and this does not rank in the quality for a ""Best Seller"".  Neither did the ""Gold Finch"" which makes me skeptical of buying supposed best sellers."
"Well, it is a compelling mystery. But all the characters are quite unlikeable. Everyone of them is so deeply flawed and make such rotten choices. Again and again and again. It got quite tiresome. I'm giving it three stars because its an easy read and the story is engaging - in a guilty pleasure kind of way...a lot like those aweful choices in the story. I just kept reading."
"This book was recommended by a friend who described it as impossible to put down. I read it fairly quickly and though I agree the story builds quickly and relentlessly -- but the story is dark and, for me, without reason or purpose. I found the main character troubled but mostly unsympathetic --damaged without the author offering much in the way of why. In fact most of the characters ranged from unsympathetic to pathological. One-dimensional -- completely self-deluded, completely self-absorbed -- completely psychopathic. Unsettling just for the purpose of building suspense. This is not a book I would recommend."

"I really did not enjoy reading this at all. If it wasn't for the movie that is coming out soon, I honestly would have quit reading very shortly after starting. It's, in my opinion, very exaggerated in the way it plays out the plot. I lost interest a few times, especially with how annoying the main character is. None of the characters are likeable, or supposed to be likeable, which I get, but it leaves the reader unable to connect to the main or even supporting characters in the book. A lot of the actions felt extremely forced, like they had to be created for the story line so the situations came off unplausible. I found myself bored more than once, and truly celebrated being finished with it. I gave it two stars instead of one, because at least it had a good editor and satisfying(ish) ending."
"I was intrigued by the beginning, but is anyone else seriously disappointed in the last 1/4 of the book?  SPOILER ALERT: Do not read further if you have not read the book!Really?  Two men on the same block who physically abuse the same two women in the same exact way?  It seems like there wasn't too much thought put into the male characters, and the last quarter of the book doesn't feel organic -- it feels contrived and forced.The female lead's actions at the end also make her incredibly stupid.  If you figure out that someone is a killer, you DO NOT physically go to that person's house and tell said murderer that you know what happened.  I can understand if these people were teenagers, but in their 30s?  Seriously?  Greatly disappointed."
"Everyday, Rachel takes the train to work. As the train comes to halt at a signal, she daydreams about the people in the houses she sees. She watches the moments of their lives that she observes from the train, and she makes up stories about them. This is merely daydreaming, until the day she witnesses something. Then, everything changes!As I read this, I kept thinking about that voyeuristic quality that I enjoyed in Hitchcock’s REAR WINDOW. We all seem to enjoy looking into other people’s lives and catching a glimpse of what a stranger’s private life might be like.This book kept me guessing until the last minute. Because the author narrated different chapters in the first person by three alternating characters, we are able to get to know them from the inside out, understand how their minds work, and see how they evolve as the tension of the murder mystery builds. This is a very clever way to both allow the reader to relate to the characters and their feelings, as well as to tell a story from varying viewpoints. I bet you can’t put this one down! I couldn’t!"
"4.5 starsCan't really explain why this story grabbed me like it did. On the surface, it doesn't seem like it should have.  It's told in first person, which I prefer, but in present tense, which I hate.  I can understand the comparison to Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl, which I loved, in that the characters aren't the least bit likable or the kind of people anyone would want to be friends with. Rachel is weak and whiny, Anna is self-absorbed and stupid, and Megan is self-indulgent and reckless. All three are ridiculously juvenile. There's very little dialogue, a huge part of the narrative is backstory, and one of the characters is constantly blacking out and remembers nothing, which I found not all that believable. Then there's the fact I guessed early on ""whodunnit"".And yet, it was a remarkably gripping read.  I was compelled to finish.  I wish I could put my finger on why.  You'll just have to dig in and see if it grabs you, too.  But know this, I am a very difficult reader to satisfy, but this book was strangely gratifying."

"Wasn't my favorite. I read it after ""The Husbands Secret"" as it was one of the recommended based on the books.  The first few chapters were a bit of a hard read to get through.  I had to keep switching back and fourth between the chapter I was reading to the chapter prior to it to remember the names and characters mentioned already.  I was pretty annoyed with the main character and everything about her.  From the first chapter she was introduced I was like ""ugh"".  She reminded me of a Jenji Kohan character, someone who just does stupid stuff all the time but yet remains in the lead. Just wasn't all the ""hype"" I was expecting.  The best part of the book when I was actually enjoying it was the last 2 chapters.  Prior to the last chapters I was just struggling to get through it and forcing myself to finish it only because I paid for it.  I hate starting books and not finishing them.  I'll finish the worst book even if it takes me 10 months off and on because I don't like leaving books unfinished.  Simply ok. Nothing amazing."
"Rachel, still raw after her divorce, travels past her former home twice a day on the commuter train. She becomes interested in an ideal couple living in a house a few doors down from where she used to live, concocting an idyllic life for the two.  Then the wife disappears, and Rachel finds herself obsessed with the mystery -- where has she gone? What has happened? Can she help the grieving husband find answers and deflect suspicion away from him? Convinced she has seen things from the train that give her extra insight into the couple, she inserts herself into the investigation. Meanwhile Anna, Rachel's ex-husband's new wife, contributes to the narrative, giving us a different view of Rachel and her motives, and making no bones about the fact that she views Rachel's intervention as an attempt to stalk her family.  In chapters alternating between Anna, Rachel, and Megan, the woman who has disappeared from her perfect life, the book gives us 3 different points of view of the story -- none of which prepares  us for the book's shocking finale."
"Ugh. So many glowing reviews, so much hype, a forthcoming movie... Color me confused. (Well, not on the movie bit -- doesn't take a good story to make a few bucks from a moving picture show).I was expecting something groundbreaking, or at the very least, something original. You'd think I'd learn not to put so much stock into reader reviews, and that even the NYTimes and NPR aren't always on target with their literary praise, but, alas, I bought into the hype.The story was banal and dull, and frankly, rather juvenile in form. There's nothing interesting or exciting in the writing style (I feel like you have to be REALLY good to pull off first-person -- it wasn't successful here), and at no point did the author convince me to care what happened to the characters (which is funny, because I'm a 30-something female who could (in theory) relate to some facets of the characters' lives).There's nothing compelling about this book, and it is an absolute mystery to me why so many glowing reviews!I'm ashamed to admit that I didn't even download the Kindle preview first. Looking for a good, late-summer read, I saw the great reviews and grabbed the whole book. My dumb mistake! You'd think I would have learned to always get the preview -- it is, after all, what saved me from the awful writing of EL James."
"I finally succumbed and bought this book to see what all the hoopla was about and, no, I haven’t seen the movie. I found it to be a super entertaining read. I finished it in the ‘wee smalls,’ unable to put it down. What I really liked about it was that though I thought I’d figured out who the evil doer was at the very beginning, the author kept leading me astray … so that I abandoned my first impression only to be surprised at the end when I found that I was right from the start!The story is told from alternating points of view which I liked, too.The novel is dark and fast-paced, the characters are complex and the plot is compelling. Highly recommended for thriller fans. Five big, bright, shiny stars"
"I had to read this book for a book club. If you spend most of your time voyouristically watching the lives of others rather than living your own life, if you love drunks and the havoc they wreak in your life and their's, if you adore weak, pathetic women who climb into a bottle at the first inkling of duplicity by their husbands, if you have a soft spot for good looking psychopaths, if you keep falling for weak men, by golly this is the book for you. The three-way point of view is a stupid contrivance for a pathetic storyline. The only character I liked or respected was Evie. Although she had no dialogue, she had the good sense to remain quite at critical times in the story. If this is the best Paula Hopkins can write, she has my sympathy. And, if the next generation really is similar to these characters, then God help us all. We're doomed."
"If you're wondering what the international ruckus is about this book, don't. I regret having squandered precious time on this overrated bestseller. The novel is simplistically written, predictably plotted, and littered with self-obsessed, uninteresting characters."
"After such great reviews I had hope this would be a good book. I like books about imperfect people; Gillian Flynn books or Bingham's Fiona Griffiths are my cup of tea. But, this is a book about stupid pathetic people, I don't have the patience for that. I did finish the book though and I am not disappointed that I read the book. I am glad I did, so I can tell you not to rely on the good reviews too much. Get it from the library to be on the safe side."
"Where do I begin? So, you have a women who's lost everything, fakes going to work, has a drinking problem, creates a story in her head about a couple she watches from a train, still obsesses over her ex-husband, claims to know the missing women in the story when she doesn't, starts seeing one of the suspects so she can try to be a private eye, sleeps with...Man, this women needs a life!I was super excited to check it out but quickly became extremly dissapointed. The pace was slow, the repitition was annoying, could had done without all the internal dialouge, the chronological order threw me off and as much as I wanted to I could not feel for any of the charcters.Sighs..."
"Like the outdated train tracks that Rachel rides across every day, what was billed as interesting is actually tedious and boring.  The books repetitive plot devices have been done to death.  It doesn't even hold up well enough to be a guilty pleasure or a campy beach read.  Its not a particularly good escape because there is nothing about her world that makes you want to be there.  Rather the story grates on in an irritatingly self-absorbed fashion....much like Rachel making yet another justification to herself to have yet another drink or three.And ike a drunkard's ramble, the story stumbles around until it reaches the end with a final, unsastisfying, meh."
"First off, I enjoyed this book. The plot was good. The pacing was good. The limited, first-person points-of-view is an effective mechanism for this story. I did figure it out, but I did not nail it down too quickly. I was definitely interested to see how it resolved. The characters, however--except for maybe two--are not exactly relatable. Each is thoroughly flawed with minimal self-awareness or empathy for anyone else. I suppose if you put enough self-absorbed folks within proximity of one another, something's bound to happen. It does! Trying to figure out what that something was and who did it was good fun. I might have liked actually liking somebody involved in all that mess, though. (Or maybe it's better that I didn't.)"
"There has been much talk about this book and being a fan of thrillers I couldn't wait to read it. I found it tedious and hard to get through. The two stars are for the way the author crafted the story and the skill used in making all her characters so utterly pathetic that i didn't care what happened to any of them and I wanted them all to meet their demise by the end. I can see why people liked it as unpredictable, I wasn't surprised by the end though I was hoping for it."
"I finally had to stop reading this book, a rarity for me.  I generally slog on, figuring that eventually everything will come together and it will be worth the parts I didn't enjoy.  This book, however, just didn't engage me.  I didn't like the characters and I couldn't get into the story.  I've read a lot of books where the protagonist's self destructive behavior and addictive personality are woven into the story.  However, in this case, she just seems sort of pathetic; I can't work up any empathy for her and finally, I just didn't want to read any more about her.  The other characters were sort of slimy as well.  Obviously others don't share my view of this book, but hey, that's why we have so many authors in the world!"
"Knowing this book was a best seller and had been made into a movie was what attracted me.  As probably all mystery/suspense genre readers do, I speculated on who might be the bad guy (nothing personal, fellas), and found myself waffling.  I did not, however, find the writing or story development as enchanting as the rest of its readers must have.  In my experience, the movie is never as good as the book.  This may be an exception."
"You know those movies, where there is a perfectly normal character who then, in the final act,  is suddenly revealed to be a psychopath?  Who, instead of killing the person who has figured it out, incredulously decides to confess to them everything they did and why they did it?  It is that cliched plot device that gives the cornered ""good guy"" the opportunity and the time to thwart the ""bad guy.""  It is lazy and uninspired writing, and it left me feeling cheated.This book commits the cardinal sin of writing.  It tells the story instead of showing the story. I'd wait for the next train if I were you."
"I finally decided to start putting down the iPad and get back to print. This was one of 3 recent book orders. Love the story. The quality of the book and print is HORRIBLE! Not sure who's manufacturing but you should never use them. Print is so bad I can't read some pages. My eyes are bad enough, I don't need a book that creates double vision! Paper is not bound well. Book will surely fall apart before I'm done. How disappointing! But, this is a first so not giving up on print yet!"
"I couldn't wait for this book to come out. It was such a disappointment. This was probably the darkest book I've ever read. Just when I thought It couldn't get any darker, it did. There were only five main characters. Not only were they all dysfunctional but it was hard to keep them straight. When the story was being told from each respective character's point of view, the writing tones were all the same and sometimes it was hard to determine who was actually doing the talking. But, I didn't give it up and finished it to its dark ending. There was absolutely no uplifting parts to tis book."
"The reader becomes a voyeur into the life of a voyeur. The characters in this book are definitely out of the norm (I hope), each with some serious problems and some extreme behaviors. There is an air of mystery as I was almost reluctantly drawn into the story, wanting to know more about these creepy people and to learn what had actually happened to them, as the story unfolds from different perspectives. It would be impossible to lump any character into a category of either ""good"" or ""bad,"" as (with all humans) each is a complex combination of both. All seem to be in need of a trusted friend,partner and/or counselor. But wait! These needs are being met by those types of people throughout the book - or are they? Is anyone truly worthy of trust? (Note: The sex and violence is not explicit.)"
"I don't know why we have this morbid fascination with murdered young women, but we do, and with all the good and mediocre novels on the subject, this one stands out as superior. It is very clever and fast-paced with a unique twist. The main character, Rachel, who has been deeply wounded by betrayal in her marriage, has become a bitter, jealous drunk, and yet she is totally lovable. When she is not harassing her ex and his new wife, she is watching the lives of others out the window of the train on her daily commute, and living vicariously through them. Until something happens that changes several lives. And Rachel saw something significant, but she can't remember what it was because she was in a blackout. Read it. You'll love it."
"I was really excited about this one, as so many people were raving over how good it was at the time I read it. Unfortunately I found it hard to get into – nothing much happened in the first 100 pages. Characters were too depressing and pathetic. Not really fond of novels where woman are written as victims who don’t do anything to help themselves, even when they start to figure out somethings wrong. Mystery wasn’t that clever or original. Liked her writing style so will try her next book, but hope it’s better than this one."
"Terrible, can't understand why it is on the bestseller list ."
"According to other reviewers, The Girl on the Train was compared to Gone Girl.  This is NO Gone Girl!  About 1/2 way through the book, I realized who dun it.  From that point on, I found the content to very redundant and 'spoon fed' to me.  I also thought there was a slightly significant difference between actual text at the end of the book and a scene leading up to the end.  Without giving too much away, the discrepancy specifically involved reference to a corkscrew,If you want a REALLY good read like Gone Girl, read Sharp Objects (or even Dark Places) and skip reading The Girl on the Train.As far as the author's writing it is somewhere between ok and good."
"I almost stopped reading it by chapter 3 - but it was suggested I finish it ""it will get better""  It didn't...was a waste of time and very disappointing.  A one star is too much for this.  I'd rather read a cereal box."
"I do find myself agreeing with several other readers that the main character was a touch difficult to connect with. At least at first.As the story unfolded and the end grew ever closer, it became clear why she'd fallen into her drinking habits and why her life was such a mess.However, I will say that if you've spent as much time reading these sorts of thrillers and studying them as I have, you may not be quite as shocked at the big reveal as others. I had it figured out several chapters ahead of time, but reading the characters reactions was still enjoyable.Overall, a fairly decent thriller!"
"The Girl on the Train fits into what I call ""junkfood literature"" - not gonna change your life, but it's a fun, easy read.  The writing is good.  The narration dragged along in some parts, but overall it held enough suspense to keep me basically hooked til the end.  Although it was entertaining and fresh, it was depressing and left me just, well . . . depressed.  If you don't mind that, give it a chance.  I won't count Paula Hawkins out for future books.  The ending even left a bit of room for a possible sequel."
"There's nothing particular that I can point out about why I hated this book.  I did finish it, just because I wanted to find out if Rachel was truly as crazy as I thought she was (she is).  I bought this based on ""if you liked Gone Girl, you'll love this"".  The only thing this book has in common with Gone Girl is that the main character was absolutely batshit crazy.  She's developed, but predictable.  She continually gets drunk, feels bad about it, then makes the same mistakes over and over again.  She is continually abusing the people in her life who are just trying to help her.  The ending did take me by surprise for about 3 sentences, then I figured out exactly what was going to happen.  Again, this is by far not the worst book I've ever read, but don't plan to read anything Paula Hawkins ever writes again."
"For once the movie was pretty close to the same as how the book was laid out, with the book of course always going into more detail because you have the narrative to back up the storyline. I do think having watched the movie before reading the book helped because the book switches back and forth many times between different timelines that would have otherwise been confusing to keep up with. Overall I was not disappointed with the book and had been wanting to read it for quite some time, glad I did."
"I really enjoyed reading this novel.  I appreciate novels that spend time developing character and this one did. Telling the story by weaving the tale together by proving us with seeing things from the aspect of the characters involved adds to the readers enjoyment by providing more mystery to the tale. In addition, I enjoy stories that show flawed characters, which we all are, and this one had its share.  ...and, as always, the book was a lot better better than the movie."
"Here we go again I thought,when I was reading about a young girl,she feels she is not longer desirable,because she off-putting in some weight,divorce,alcoholic,lost control of her life, misery,loneliness,mentally unstable,almost stop reading this great book,is very interesting keep you in suspense,I didn't do nothing all day,I can't put it down,is so good reading,I didn't waste my day,this book is worthy my time,ha ha ha, I recommended you will like it a lot,I give 5 stars because keep me like a glued,and that is something that makes me happy,Thelma."
"This book made feel goosebumps. Certain parts were written very well that it had me looking behind my shoulder. Good mystery had me guessing pretty much the whole way convincing me along the way that it could of been others. Only negative to me was that some parts felt like fillers pointless and dragging on very few though. I recommend this to any mystery reader, people struggling with alcohol (me), and I personally think those books are awfully written but any fan of fifty shades of grey would enjoy this. Watching the film later."
"The inner thoughts in this book are compelling narratives by women who act badly and hate themselves for it. Unremitting self-destructive thoughts, abuse of themselves and getting themselves abused by others, and alcohol dominate their lives. The plot  is a very intelligently constructed mystery that depends on these women being the way they are, and their struggles to escape their nature. A very satisfying read."
"The only reason I didn't stop reading this book after the first 100 pages is because I kept thinking surely this novel will pick up it's pace at some point.  Not this novel.  Slow moving, very predictable and lame.  The one positive I can say is good character development.  I do not recommend this novel."
"I devoured this book in just a few days, which is rare for me these days, but a sure sign that it was good as I could not put it down. It's got a very Gone Girl-esque feel, and until the last few chapters I was totally in the dark as to how the story was going to end (and I only got an idea as to how it would because I cheated and peeked ahead a few chapters one night). Recommend if you enjoy thrillers and suspense novels!"
"Rachel, an obsessive alcoholic who has blackouts, is struggling with life after divorce and sinking further and further into oblivion.  She becomes involved in a missing person case that she witnesses from a train and the case gradually takes over her life.I was torn between giving this book five stars or one star.  Why?  Because, while it's clever, it was excruciatingly slow to get to the point.  It is told in the first person, in turns, by three women, all s-l-o-w-l-y painting a hazy picture of a puzzle that isn't explained until the very last pages. It was extremely frustrating and a few parts were borderline boring.However, I was fascinated by the author's stream-of-consciousness style even in the present tense, which I usually dislike.  There is virtually no dialogue for the first 30 pages, just rambling thoughts. The pace definitely picked up toward the end and got really exciting.  Then, I was hooked and couldn't turn the pages fast enough to discover the very satisfying conclusion.There is a very small cast of characters, none of whom are very likable, and yet the book held my interest throughout.  Something different."
"OK, I know it's only February, but I read a lot -- usually at least 3 to 6 books per month. I read this novel more slowly than normal, savoring the storyline, the prose, the character development. I found the concept of the storyline original and intriguing, the characters believable, and the ending surprising (so to the reviewer who expressed boredom and disappointment with an obvious conclusion, um, maybe you should be a detective or a mystery writer 'cuzl I so did not see that coming!) I was immediately drawn in and caught up in the story, and stayed up too late reading on more nights than is good for me if I want to keep my job. I found Ms. Harkins's writing entrancing, and even the shifting points of view and jumps back and forth in the chronology didn't bother me; rather they added a dimension of realism to the inevitable unreliability of multiple narratives.I'm not going to rehash the plot yet again. Yes, Rachel is a fall-down blackout lying drunk who's stalking her ex husband. Does that make her unsympathetic or unlikable? Maybe. She's also a disillusioned woman who has never fully dealt with devastating losses in her life. Which probably have contributed to her becoming a fall-down blackout lying drunk. (Yes, I know that's a sentence fragment.) Or, perhaps I just liked her because I used to be a fall-down blackout lying drunk with stalker tendencies. And, I guess the fact that I didn't foresee the ending can be attributed to brain damage from all that alcohol consumption.Anyway, I loved the book and didn't want it to end. I highly recommend it to fans of Gone Girl and The Husband's Secret. If you're an Alfred Hitchcock addict, as I am, I think you'll enjoy this novel."
Hummmmmm. So many with the same title. Confusing and all the back many forth from one character to another.  I read it because of the movie....I like the UK setting and have been on the train...... a bit disappointed in this but stayed with it even though I had it figured out.
"The Girl on the Train is like no other book I have ever read before. Typically I read historical fiction and contemporary romance so this book isn't usually what I would buy but I had heard it was impossible to put down. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the novel even though it was creepy and I felt that nothing quite added up. Something always felt a bit off. The novel had me at the edge of my seat and I finished the second half of the book in one day. I really had a hard time putting it down because the author has a way with storytelling where she ends the chapter with a cliffhanger and I just had to know what happened next. The book switches back and forth between the female narrators and the dates when certain events took place so it was sometimes a bit difficult to follow in the beginning and keep track of where everyone was on the same date but after awhile the dates got closer together and everything came together. The ending was a big surprise to me and I never would've guessed it. Like I said, I don't typically read psychological thrillers but I am glad I took a chance on this one. I highly recommend this novel to everyone, regardless of your preference in literary genres."
"I really enjoyed the way the tale is told from the perspective of the three women. It held my attention while tempting me, consistently, to ponder the next turn and unfold the connections and clues that take the reader round the next corner of the story. After finishing the book I rented the movie and found it to be an awful interpretation."
"Wow! I loved this book and to think that I almost didn't read it. For whatever reason, I had a hard time connecting with the book in the beginning, but kept at it at the insistence of so many friends. I am so glad I did. It was slow at the beginning, but it paid off in the end. The book is told from the point of view of three different women. The unreliable narrator tactic worked well with the way the author told the story from different dates. If you liked Gone Girl you will like this book. I don't see how my review is even necessary or helpful considering how many reviews this amazing book and author already have, but I wanted to share anyway. Once I got into the book, I could not put it down and had to know what would happen next. I guessed who the killer was, but I don't think that means anything. The book is a psychological thriller not a mystery so the suspense comes from wondering if our MC will escape the dangers posed by the villain and not from solving the mystery of who dun it. It was a nail biting experience at the end as I worried for two of the main characters and wondered what would happen. I can't say more without giving it away.If you are one of the few who has not read this book, you simply must read it. Please don't let the slow start put you off. You will see, soon enough that it was worth the wait. This novel is unique and not like any other book out there. It shares many of the same plot techniques and narrative as Gone Girl, but the story is completely different from Gone Girl and from any other book. That's what makes the book such a hit.If you have read this book and loved it like I did, I highly recommend that you read, Peter Swanson's The Kind Worth Killing. It hooks you much quicker and it is every bit as good as The Girl on the Train. Both are at the top of my all time favorite books. You can read my in depth review of The Kind worth Killinghttp://www.melissasugarwrites.com/2015/05/the-kind-worth-killing-review-with.html"
I enjoyed this book. I liked the character development. I did have to go back from time to time to see which character I was reading about and the story was choppy at times but I loved the final chapters and couldn't put it down since I just had to know what was going to happen. I liked the premise of someone on a train fantasizing about the lives of the people they watch daily from a train window. I hope to read more from this author.
"This is an excellent psychological thriller about an alcoholic and her imaginations from riding a train daily.  She gets involved in making up stories about a couple who live on the train route as she longs for her ex-husband who lives on the same street.  As a recovering alcoholic, I found it a little difficult to live through her drunken sprees and blackouts but it all comes together in the end with the unexpected ending. Highly recommend it."
"This novel is written in first-person of three women, which provides the tension and perspective. The premise is engaging, and I was most intrigued by the insight it offers into the struggles of addiction. I have experienced the same cycling and thought patterns that the narrators are subjected to. The author either has been there herself, or is intimately acquainted with such persons.Though the story drags a bit occasionally, it will keep you reading to the end."
"I couldn't put this book down once I really got into it.  I especially liked the last third of the book.  I loved the use of multiple narrators.  The book has inspired me to begin working on my first book.  Of note, I may be guilty of liking the book's style more so than the actual story or characters. Sue me."
"I kept reading hoping that I would get to the end ASAP.  I got tired of all the jumping around with flashbacks and then back to the present as well as jumping from character to character trying to keep them straight.  I just wasn't worth it to me to have spent so much time on such a disappointment.  I believe that there might be some readers who would find the book passable, but i did not."
I have only read about 22% and am so bored I have gone on to another book.  Sorry I bought this book
"Wonderful idea, poorly executed towards the end. I really wanted to like this, but the last half of the book DRAGGED. Maybe one good reveal every 45 minutes (used the audio book). It also started to feel a little messy and disorganized with the jumping perspectives and timelines. 3 stars because while a solid half of the book was annoying, I enjoyed the tail end."
"Let me start by saying, I don't understand the hype of being riveting. Before you get upset, this is not a slam or bad review. I did rate it four stars! This is my honest review and I didn't find it riveting.I did, however, find that it was very well written and intriguing. I was about 3/4 of the way through the book before I something crucial clicked and once it did, it all made sense.It did take me several chapters to realize it was bouncing timeframes. I had gotten really confused until I went back and double checked the dates. Things fell into place better after that.I got quite angry at Rachel but that was the nature of her character. The book elicits most of the correct feelings and moods as it should but I wasn't riveted to it and it took me longer than it should have to read it. The one thing I didn't feel enough of, or any, was dread. There should have been a great deal of dreadful feelings with a sense of foreboding. It just want there for me, maybe I read too many suspense/mystery/thriller novels to truly appreciate this book.Those are my Novel Thoughts, though I can't guarantee a Happily Ever After."
"Pay attention to the chapter titles!  I was completely confused for the first third of the book, but once I understood it not only changed chronological order but also the first person telling the story with each chapter, it all made sense.. .to the point that by the end I almost knew ""who dunnit"".  Overall good story and well written."
"This book was a selection of my book group. It did not particularly interest me but my husband thought it sounded interesting and we like to read together. So we read the Kindle edition which did not have actual page numbers, and used the percent read to keep track of our progress. Somewhere around 80% our persistence to finish the book began to pay off. Both of us are glad to have it finished."
"This is a story of nasty dudes and naive women. I loved it. It’s being compared to Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, but that’s not a good comparison. They are both amazing in their own ways and for very different reasons. This book has so many questions that have to be answered. Is Megan dead or did she run away? Both are plausible. Why is Rachel so obsessed with her? Is it just her imagination? Why is Tom so passive of Rachel’s constant intrusions? Who is sleeping with who? Does Anna have any redeeming qualities?The characters are flawed and some are downright detestable. The story focuses on three women: Rachel, the drunk who can’t let go of her ex-husband, Anna, the one who stole him away, and Megan, the beautiful missing woman.Rachel was a great character to read. She is completely broken and her only escape is with alcohol. The story is told from first-person perspective and doesn’t have a whole lot of dialogue, so her chapters were desperate and lonely. I could put myself in her shoes. She is someone who is easy to pity, as she travels the train everyday, pretending to go to a job that she was fired from months ago. Every day she looks at a house, only a few down from where she once lived, and watches a loving couple. She creates a make-believe world around them, perfect in every way. It’s an obvious set-up for disappointment.Anna is not likeable. At no point in the book did I feel anything for her but contempt. She knowingly begins an affair with a married man, none other than Rachel’s husband Tom, and effectively steals him away. Granted, Rachel’s depression makes it easy for her. At one point, while she’s admiring her and Tom’s sleeping baby, she remembers the days of sneaking around with him and admits that she misses being a mistress. She loved the sense of danger and wishes she could go back to it. All she feels towards Rachel is disgust. She was a good chunk of the book and suffice it to say that her chapters filled me with my own sense of disgust, aimed at her.Next is Megan, the one I’m not sure how to feel about. Partly, she reminds me of Anna, with her “I don’t care about anyone but me” attitude, but she also reminds me of Rachel, with her struggle against depression and insomnia. Her tragic past is the only part of her character that I could stand, as the rest of the time she’s thinking purely about herself and her memories of when she ran an art gallery and had men drooling over her. Surely, she would be appalled to be compared to Rachel, who is described as being overweight, drunk, and repulsive. Megan’s selfishness is sometimes nauseating, but then a wee bit of humanity shines through. Ultimately, I felt sorry for her, but I didn’t like her.The men in the story are a puzzle. There’s good and bad. It’s a confusing mess and I wasn’t always sure which man I was reading about through these women’s thoughts. Have no fear, the book did not leave me with a total sense of hopelessness concerning men in general, even though the author did not show them in a positive light.It’s definitely a mystery. I had inklings all the way through, but it wasn’t until about seventy percent through that I said, “Ah-ha!” I’m always impressed with a book that can keep me guessing more than halfway through and this one definitely did. It wasn’t a huge surprise to me, but it was an unpleasant one. In the beginning, everything is up in the air. No one is safe from doubt, not even poor Rachel. Nothing is completely settled until the very end, as it should be, leading to a perfectly short and powerful climax.The end was fulfilling, yet a little disappointing. I do not like happy-happy endings, but this one lacked hope. It was hinted at, but only one of these women gets to speak and her thoughts are still terrified and troubled. I would have liked to see more resolution for her. As it was, it felt sort of incomplete. My takeaway is that everyone lives in their own distorted version of reality and when the truth shows up it can have devastating repurcussions. So, don’t lie and don ‘t cheat.For the rating:Genre and general reading age – it’s a mystery and thriller. Reading age is adult, due to some really difficult scenes and references, including excessive drinking by more than one of the characters. Sometimes I wondered how they were able to stand up.The level of sexuality – for the amount of cheating involved, it was surprisingly mild. There weren’t actual sex scenes, but memories of trysts and a morning after.Was there graphic language? Not much.Did I cry? Nope.Is it part of a series? Nope.Level of character development was very high. Out of the three men and three women who make up the story, only one was a bit weak. The others were strong and I could see them in my mind.Did I laugh? Nope.This was a fantastically-written story and once I picked it up I couldn’t put it down, literally. I stayed up late into the night with this one. I’m happy to give it <U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F>.5 stars. It was almost perfect."
I didn't like this book. Sometimes less is more and it's annoying when a villain explains all their motives before they kill someone. Pretty much how this book ends and it reminded me of a silly scary movie.
"I got off to a slow start, had to re-read the beginning to keep the key characters apart.  The three primary characters are all speaking in first person so at first they were all running together, to me.  But after the first few chapters, it hooked me.  It is a true ""who done it"" - and I was surprised.  Had some theories through the whole book but they were knocked away."
"Just finished reading this amazing thriller. I wanted to read the book before watching the movie and I am so glad that I did. It kept me up several nights past my bedtime because I just couldn't put it down. The story line was amazing and I swear I thought almost every character was the killer at one point or another. Definitely picked my brain. Would totally read another book by this author. It's now on my list of favorites, right up there with Gone Girl!"
"I was contemplating to skip this review. I don’t like to be negative, just because it may not be my cup of tea. In a real life I practice a rule, what I don’t understand, I simply respect, instead of judging it.This is a book review site, and I feel I have to stay true to its purpose.I was very excited to read this book after all the commercial hype about it. I have to admit that I set myself for a real disappointment. I will try to stay constructive and short.CONS:Title - The word ‘girl’ is completely wrong for a divorced thirty something WOMAN.Plot - Predictable, similar concept “Lady on the train” 1945.Characters - Three messed up women, two abusive men. All narrators speak in first person.Ending - Completely flat, fell apart.Pace - First half very slow.PROS:Writing - Paula Hawkins has a unique narrative structure.To me this wasn’t really a mystery, more like a character study. I don’t mind depressing, negative or dark, but non of the characters were likable enough to root for them."
"Fabulous. Long & slow going, actually, but every step of the way hypnotic. The tiny details of human character, that's what pulls you on. These characters at first seem so mundane & ordinary, but what explosions lie within each of them! This whole story is like the peeling of an onion, revealing more and more, until you don't want to look anymore, but are compelled to. Sensational!!"
"I agree with some other reviewers. The characters in this novel were all annoying and not believable.  The main character, Rachel, you just want to reach out and smack some sense into her.  I just keep reading so I could be done with it. It is one crazy female after another, surrounded by awful men. I fail to see why this book is getting so many good reviews. Stay away."
"I still don't get it.  I tried to like this story because it was such a big best seller, but just couldn't get into it and was not at all drawn to any of the characters or their unique situations.  Probably the best part was the end, which exposed a maniacal killer.  I realize the narrative is British, but the author could use some grammar checks."
"It is popular and I was curious. It is interesting as a tour de force in the psychological genre, but I found it diffuse and a bit tedious. I never felt that I cared about any of the characters in the story. The journey I was being led on thus never really captured my imagination. To me, that is a significant failure in plot and character development. Perhaps, it is just not my type."
"Put aside plenty of time to read this book.I am always looking for books that are character driven.  The main protagonist is damaged, broken and an alcoholic.  She is not someone that welcomes warm and fuzzy moments.  Her life has been spiraling out of control for some time.  Her choices and habits come back to bite her on a regular basis.It took a while for me to engage with this character.  As an addict in recovery, this book cause me to squirm quite a bit.  I've lived her story in many ways.  I had to overcome my comfort level to continue to read this book.  I am glad I did.There are so many layers to this book.  It is the proverbial onion, complete with aspects that sting the eyes to near tears.The plot has so many twists and turns.  It is very much like that rollercoaster that you avoid at all costs.  Your friends and family tease you, prod you, yet you steadfastly say never.  Next thing you know, you are on that rollercoaster, unsure the bar across will hold you in.  After wards, you are asked whether you enjoyed it.  With a wry smile, you say quietly, ""Yes, yes I did.""The many reviews of this book may not do it justice.  I suspect the intrepid reader will find within its nooks and crannies a very satisfying read."
"No wonder they made a movie from this book. It was a great story! Characters developed as you turn each page, and the plot was thick with mystery, betrayal, love, heartbreak, murder, and it was an awesome thriller!"
"Interesting, compelling storyline and definitely held my attention to the end.  The characters and their flaws just kept coming but not in a way that detracted but instead pulled you into the story tighter and tighter.  I must admit to feeling exhausted by the time it ended.I can certainly understand why this book was chosen to become a movie."
"While Rachel is not the most sympathetic protagonist (drunks usually aren't) her story is a fascinating one. Interesting approach in this book to weave the viewpoints together of the major participants. Lots of false leads, red herrings, and the self centered perspectives that people often have combine for an interesting mystery and a fascinating read."
Couldn't stop reading<U+200B> it to see how it ended but it was not an enjoyable read. Not one character was likable. Ending not terribly satisfying either.
"I wonder if I was the only person who hoped that Rachel would also at some point, be murdered. She was almost unbearably pathetic and unfortunately without any other strong, likable characters I just found myself whipping through the book so I didn't have to be reading it anymore."
"One of the better ""whodunits"" I've read in recent years.  The economic and social strictures of post-Thatcherian suburbia set the background for this surprisingly powerful novel about a ""girl"" (unemployed) on a ""train"" (daily commuter run) who has little better to do than shuttle back and forth from home to London -- and muse about the life she wished she'd had.  Not fast, but compelling.  The characters are not chock-full of surprises until the very end of the novel, but they are moved along well enough by author Paula Hawkins. Narration and dialog are British, of course, but not so tough as to move us Yanks to the urbandictionary more often than occasionally.If, indeed, you liked the book/movie GONE GIRL you will probably like this one too."
"How does a writer get me to feel empathy for a lying, busy-body, pathetic drunk? Rachel had a nice life in the suburbs until difficulty conceiving drove her to drink—in excess! To the point she lost everything. She’s obsessed with her ex, even though he has moved on with another wife and child. Now she’s become obsessed with a couple she sees from the commuter train. She’s given them names and created a fairy tale life for them. Until the day she sees something that shatters the illusion.This suspense has everything. The characters are well-developed; the pace moves along; there are plot twists throughout. It kept me guessing. This is a hard-to-put-down novel. I didn’t want it to end!"
"Took me a while to adapt to the writer's style, but the story kept me going and I soon got accustomed to the very ""British"" style (and the somewhat anaccronistic setting as the story developed). No wonder it was adapted into a blockbuster motion picture!!"
"Flat, predictable, poorly written. I'd have dropped it midbook (which I almost never do) had it not been part of a book club."
"What I found interesting about The Girl on the Train is that it is told by 3 unreliable female narrators, each of whom is quite unlikeable. In fact, the cast of characters in this book is fairly small and there’s not a likable character in the bunch. Is it weird of me to say that it was almost a relief to not feel like I had to root for anyone? The women all become more sympathetic by the end of the story, but overall it was fun to read a book that I didn’t want to put down without having any emotional ties to any one character.I found this book to be fairly fast-paced and without much extraneous plot that wasn’t related to the mystery. I couldn’t put it down because I just had to know how it ended. Whereas I found myself baffled by the lack of a decisive ending in Gone Girl, this was not the case in The Girl on the Train and I appreciated that a full story was told from start to finish, with no open questions remaining.It’s an intriguing mystery that will be just as good as you pass the time on a cold winter’s night as it will be this summer on the beach."
"Dull, tedious & the ""plot twist"" was yawn-inspiring. Let's just say I wasn't expecting a 300 page diary of a drunk woman."
"I admit it was slow at the start. But once you were caught in the web of the story, there is just no letting go. The layers are exceptional, and the story unpredictable. I really enjoyed this book and in the end couldn't put it down. Absolutely wonderful."
Not bad novel. Wanted to read it before watching the movie. After reading the book don't think I will bother watching the movie. Not my kind of story.
"It took quite an effort to get through it It really draggeedandwas depressing at least half way through it. After reading, I will skip the movie."
"I loved this book, more than I thought I would. Love the multiple narrators with the different perspectives, the swirling revelations that are revealed in an almost rollercoaster fashion. I've missed sleep to read and finish it .that says a lot for me!"

For a debut novel, it was a brilliant depiction of the most basic elements of fallen human nature--envy, greed, lust, deceit, all tied in with murder, emotional and sexual hunger, and obsession on a grander scale.I am thankful to my new favorite author, Paula Hawkins, for:1) Not giving us a Gone Girl ending, especially with all the main characters' aversion to truth. This type of unpredictability suited Gone Girl because of the utter vileness of the ''heroine,""and we know that life never turns out the way we want, and sometimes evil triumphs over good. But I think letting Rachel live and killing off Tom finally gave the reader some breathing room to say, ""Finally. Something goes right."" (Or at least that's what I say, given that I felt like I was reading the book on a fast-paced train with my pulse beating fast and heartbeat ricocheting in my chest.)2)Giving me a character I can relate to. Only instead of alcohol, I'm addicted to caffeine. I felt that Rachel Watson was somewhat of an extension of me. We're both curious, (need to know), we're both driven by a sense of doing what's right (if you see something, say something), although I don't know if I would have had the nerve to do what she did, we've both said our share of ""I'm sorry"" to people we love (after acting similarly), and we're both fat. Instant buddies for sure. Throughout the novel, she makes stupid decisions (just like I do), but I found myself feeling protective of her. I did not want her to meet Megan's fate. So thanks to Ms. Hawkins for giving me a new best friend.3). Writing a book with a potential for changing lives. At the core of this novel is this undeniable theme: We are all only humans. We have our successes, our failures. Our strengths, our weaknesses. We are individually different but together all the same. All of us have hope of redemption. Rachel was an alcoholic until she realized the value of memory over apologizing for things she doesn't remember. Anna liked being the homewrecker until she found out the train wreck her life had become with Tom's infidelity and her ex-nanny's betrayal. For some, redemption was too late. Megan and Tom wanted something they could not obtain in their own lives so they reached out to each other for a temporary pleasure, which inevitably costs them their lives. Though the reality of my life is nowhere nearly that drastic, I can honestly say that I am somewhat changed by the lessons in this novel. It has touched my heart in ways that only truly great literature can.Though I'm sad at the end of this journey and that I have to debark, I hope other readers will get the chance to ride this fast-paced thriller on wheels, accompanied by suspense and page-turning anticipation running through their fingertips."
"The Girl on the Train is yet another twist on the classic whodunit. The story is told through the point of view of three women, each with their own flaws and secrets. We meet Rachel Watson, a drunk, unemployed, divorcee who daydreams about the ""perfect"" life of Jess and Jason - a couple she only knows by seeing them from the train every day. When Jess (Megan Hipwell) turns up missing, Rachel takes it upon herself to solve the case. Through a series of lies and deceit, Rachel finds herself face to face with a cast of male characters (all deeply flawed themselves), anyone of whom could be the killer.My thoughts on the book:The writing style is just horrendous and completely unnecessary. The entire book is written in first person, though our POV switches between the three female characters: Rachel, Megan, and Anna. This can lead to confusion when the action flips back and forth. Had this use of first person worked to reveal something about the characters that could just not be said through third-person omniscient, it could have worked. But it was complicated by the fact that each chapter was broken into ""Morning"" and ""Evening"", so the tense switched back and forth between present and past tense. I get that breaking it up this way reflects the two train trips, one in to the city, one back home, but it is unnecessary as most of the action takes place off the train. These two combined makes it difficult to read.This is Hawkins' first novel, and it shows. The bland writing style bored me to death, and it took everything I had in me to finish the book. Stephen King can spend 80% of a book writing about nothing and I love every word of it. Hawkins drew out a boring story where we learn to hate every character involved. Not a single character has a good redeeming quality.I was genuinely surprised when the killer was revealed. I was not shocked, however, and this is a huge negative. When I read the reveal in ""Gone Girl"", I had to put the book down. I could not continue because I had to process what I had just read. I have had this happen in many other books. Good fiction is emotional. You feel shocked because you're so invested in the story and characters. Here, I was just glad it was over.Conclusions:I read this book simply because the movie is coming out soon and it was well known and liked. I was disappointed throughout, and expected much more. There are many things (see above) that could have improved this book. The plot was not bad, it was just poorly developed. The characters were not unbelievable, but they sure were unlikable. The style and prose were atrocious; nothing short of a full rewrite could have saved that.Read at your own risk. If being part of the crowd is more important to you than reading quality fiction, this is your book."
"I was so excited to finally read The Girl on the Train after hearing a plethora of positive reviews from both friends and critics. I love a good psychological thriller, and I hoped this would be no exception. As soon as I started reading the book I was sucked into the story. I couldn't stop turning pages, and I needed to find out what happened. Unfortunately, I guessed the outcome of the novel right from the beginning, and that really detracted from my enjoyment of the story.The Girl on the Train is the story of Rachel, a twenty-something alcoholic who still loves her ex-husband, despite the fact that he cheated on her and dumped her for the other woman. The book opens with Rachel taking the train every day. She makes up stories about the houses the train goes past on the way, and she loves watching a couple she deems as perfect. One day, the woman in the couple is with another man, and Rachel is quite upset about her cheating. The next day Rachel wakes up a mess after a night of drinking. She has very limited memories of her night, but it turns out the woman she watches from the train is now missing, and she is worried she might be connected to her disappearance in some way.The writing in this book is really well done and quite easy to read, too. I think this is a great novel for those of you who are not big readers, or perhaps you are transitioning from young adult to adult books. While the pacing is generally very quick, I did feel a bit bored during the middle of the book, when I felt like the action slowed down a bit. This is especially true, for me, in hindsight. Because I was able to predict the ending of the book right from the start, it rendered most of the novel moot. I felt like the author walked me around in circles when she could have walked me in a straight line.Nonetheless, I really appreciate the plethora of important issues discussed in The Girl on the Train. For example, Rachel's alcoholism stems from her inability to have children. It makes me so frustrated to think of how women are often deemed worthless if they are unable to have children, even in today's society where we are working so hard to achieve equality between the sexes. I felt so sad for Rachel, and wanted her to get help throughout the book. In fact, I really appreciate that all of the characters in The Girl on the Train are so flawed. I've seen many reviews in which readers criticize the author for writing only terrible characters. Yes, many of the characters in this book do horrible and deplorable things, but I see most of them as having redeemable qualities as well. Other important topics discussed in this book are mental illness, the role of women in society, whether you can really know someone, and when, if ever, can we find truth in life.Overall, The Girl on the Train was a fun read, and I'm glad I picked it up due to its popularity and film adaptation. I am a bit disappointed that the big twist at the end was so predictable, and that is the main reason why I am giving this three out of five stars. That being said, I think The Girl on the Train is the perfect book to read with friends because there are so many topics to be discussed. I will definitely check out any other books that Paula Hawkins writes in the future as well, since I did fly through this one!*This review originally posted on Goodreads"
"I was blown away by this psychological thriller, a debut psychological thriller at that! I was fascinated by the idea of this woman secretly spying on residents everyday as she rides the 8:04 train. People watching is fun, I enjoy doing it when I’m forced to be social, but the situation this woman involves herself in is far more complicated, and personal, than she expected. (And something I’m not motivated enough to involve myself with- bye Felicia.)Coming out of a rough divorce, Rachel finds herself at an all time low. She drinks to dull her emotional pain, she rides the train into town without a sense or purpose, and now she finds herself meddling in other’s peoples affairs- literally. As a former resident of Blenheim Road, she’s always watching as she passes by... Until one day, she sees something, within the blink of an eye, that kick starts an investigation she’s stuck in the middle of.Rachel begins her own personal investigation after the police have made it quite clear they won’t be listening to an unstable drunk. The case had me jumping to conclusions after each chapter. I wanted answers and wanted them now. I was desperate to read faster, to unlock another clue that would lead me in the right direction of solving the mystery.Hawkins wrote chapters from alternating points of view, revealing pertinent bits of information at the right moment. The minute I had an inkling on who the perpetrator could have been, something new was thrown into the equation and I’d be back to square one. Mad props on your trickster ways and skills, Paula.One of my favorite things about reading this genre is trying to figure out/solve the mystery before it’s revealed. (Movies, too!) It’s a trait I inherited from my dad. Books I can’t figure out/solve are always enjoyable; whether I’m reading and frantically turning pages as if they’re more important than air, or taking my time to absorb the details and take notes, they engulf me. Sleep is for the weak, I need answers.The Girl on the Train was a nail biter and I was hooked on the story the entire time. I look forward to future works by this author!"
"""My mother used to tell me that I had an overactive imagination...""And with that, Rachel the narrator certainly becomes one of the most unreliable narrators I've ever had the pleasure of reading. There are actually several points of view in 'The Girl on the Train' but Rachel is the main narrator. A sad sack of a woman, she has been recently divorced, fired from her job in London and is losing a nasty battle with the bottle. Because she is often drunk, nothing she says or recalls is trustworthy.I needed a break from my usual contemporary romances and this thriller kept me glued to my Kindle! Rachel sees a ""prefect couple"" from the train every day, and she concocts an elaborate fantasy life for them. Surely they must live a perfect life! Unlike her, they seem to live a charmed life, sitting in their pretty garden every day, sipping coffee together.""I don’t know their names, either, so I had to name them myself. Jason, because he’s handsome in a British film star kind of way, not a Depp or a Pitt, but a Firth, or a Jason Isaacs. And Jess just goes with Jason, and it goes with her. It fits her, pretty and carefree as she is. They’re a match, they’re a set. They’re happy, I can tell. They’re what I used to be, they’re Tom and me five years ago. They’re what I lost, they’re everything I want to be.""Slowly we realize that in fact NOTHING in this book is as it seems, and Rachel is soon drawn into a frightening situation about which, sadly for her, she has no memory. On top of everything else, Rachel is constantly morose and sad, depressed about the loss of her beloved husband Tom, and begins to drive everyone away who ever cared about her.""Beautiful sunshine, cloudless skies, no one to play with, nothing to do. Living like this, the way I’m living at the moment, is harder in the summer when there is so much daylight, so little cover of darkness, when everyone is out and about, being flagrantly, aggressively happy. It’s exhausting, and it makes you feel bad if you’re not joining in.""Rachel drinks so much that she begins to black out. She stalks her ex-husband and his new wife Anna but just can't seem to stop herself.""I have lost control over everything, even the places in my head.""This book takes many twists and turns and nothing at all is at it seems. Just when I thought I knew where the story was going, it veered off into another place entirely. it is smart, perfectly paced and filled with flawed, all-too-human characters. Even though Rachel is COMPLETELY unlikable, I was cheering for her throughout the book.'The Girl on the Train' is smart, clever and surprising. Glad I read it before I saw the movie. Highly recommend!!"
"I admit that I’m no expert when it comes to this genre. In fact, as to date, I have only read three books including this that falls under this category, so I will have to base my review on the general impact of the novel to me to the best of my ability.In my personal opinion, this book passes the mystery-thriller-suspense-crime criteria with flying colors! What makes me say this has a great deal to do with the hypnotic writing style of the author- there is something eerie but magnetic with it and it is a huge mystery to me how the author is able to put across layers of meanings in the simplest thoughts and the most mundane phrases the female characters who are also the narrators utter.It is also noteworthy how the author, in order to craft this forbidding tale, deftly chose these three women who are most flawed and most foolish and yet are unexplainably capable of receiving the reader’s empathy. Of the three POV’s, I was most glued to that of Rachel’s (the major character) whose loneliness seems to magnify her imagination which consequently becomes the core of the plot.It is also quite impressively baffling that the plot seems both linear and rounded at the same time. I felt like nothing happens so much but at the same time, it also felt like everything is happening and unraveling right under my nose and I couldn’t control my heart from hammering against my chest. There were times I had to stop reading and allow the creeps to surface above my skin."
"Although I understand the process of jumping around on time frames in this book it seemed a little more bewildering than some others I have read. In fact for the first hundred pages I really had a hard time getting into the story because Rachel was so pathetic that she was hard to even root for. This does not mean she was not a well-developed character nor does it mean the book was poorly written. I simply had a hard time identifying with any of the characters and it may be because the author was attempting to use Rachel's black periods as a device to make you question what really happened. About two-thirds of the way through the book I had determined who I believed killed Megan so the only thing left to do was to see who lived who died and who went to jail. The finale of the book was well done and feel true to form. I appreciate the story and I always enjoy a mystery but this book did not grab me as much as some others I have read recently. I still think many people would really enjoy reading the book and of course it would make a wonderful movie as has already been done. I simply believe that there are other books that do suspense better than this one although this is a fun read and I cannot say I was disappointed by it. Some of it just felt like it had been done before and in some cases better. As you can see I still believe it was a 4 out of 5 and therefore worth the time to read. Pardon the grammar, it is difficult to write a review on your cell phone."
"pooled ink Reviews:2.5 StarsObviously I was hyped after watching that thrilling movie trailer and decided I would buy the book and read it before I saw the movie. So I did. And now I’m slightly less inclined to see the movie. (But I’ll probably still go because a) Emily Blunt and b) Ooooo it looks crazy!)The book travels up and down the rails following Rachel’s cyclic battle with alcoholism and her obsession with solving Megan’s case as she continues to tangle her life with those linked to Megan, get incredibly drunk, make embarrassing not-great decisions, realizes what she’s done, decides not to drink for half a second and then downs a bottle or two of wine to drown out her embarrassment and misery only to make more poor decisions. It became wearing to read about it for so many pages. Alcoholism is a real problem, I know that, and I also know that I don’t sound very sympathetic, but that’s why I didn’t go to school to become a therapist.The whole book was pretty consistent…and boring. And the killer? It was obvious. I bet you can guess who it was. And the why? It’s pretty easy to guess as well, at least part of it.It’s not a very long book…but it felt long. It felt like the same stuff over and over again. There was nothing exhilarating, surprising, jolting, unnerving. I felt none of it. The only part I enjoyed was the ending of the book when characters starting changing, clues started showing, and all the little lines began meeting to reveal what happened that Saturday night when Megan went missing.All in all this book is filled with sad people with messed up lives making stupid decisions that only work to further ruin their lives. I was tired of reading about it. I just kept waiting for someone to do something worth applauding, but that didn’t come until the very end.Psychological thriller? I think not. THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is a dull commute that only succeeded in making me snooze as I let the gentle rocking of the train lull me into a stupor. Definitely a story better executed as a movie than a book.Read my FULL review here: [...]"
"The Girl on the Train fits into what I call ""junkfood literature"" - not gonna change your life, but it's a fun, easy read.  The writing is good.  The narration dragged along in some parts, but overall it held enough suspense to keep me basically hooked til the end.  Although it was entertaining and fresh, it was depressing and left me just, well . . . depressed.  If you don't mind that, give it a chance.  I won't count Paula Hawkins out for future books.  The ending even left a bit of room for a possible sequel."
"Books that garner tons of praise frequently make me suspicious and often disappoint.  As my father's fond of saying: ""just because it's a best seller doesn't mean it's a best reader"" and he's right.  So I ignored this NYT best seller for months but saw that it's being made into a movie and decided to give it a shot.  This is indeed a ""Hitchcockian"" thriller that slowly unwinds and leads to an ending that wraps things up but is a bit unsatisfying...maybe because after all the build up I expected more.  Still, this is one of the more engaging books I've read in awhile and it was hard to put down once I got going.  Alcoholic train commuter Rachel likes to watch out the window going to/from the city and enjoys making up a life for a couple she frequently sees outdoors on their terrace.  Then she witnesses what appears to be infidelity and then someone goes missing but Rachel's frequent alcohol fueled blackouts make her unsure of what she's seen and what she truly knows.  Paula Hawkins freshman novel is a winner and I'd definitely read her next effort."
"Ok, here's the deal. When a person takes the time and puts in the effort to write a book they automatically get at least 3 stars from me. Now, she is a good writer as far as the technical aspects go and she is fine with the creative elements as well, so I push it to 4 stars. However, I just wasn't terribly moved emotionally or mentally in any new way to give her 5 stars. To get 5 stars you really need to go the distance. You really need to stand out above the crowd with originality and creativity. you really need to move me and to shake me and/or alter my perception or change or challenge my way of thinking or something out of the same old same old, even if I don't like a book for other reasons I can give 5 stars if the author pushes my buttons or gets under my skin. This book does not go the distance. However it is a worthy read in a world of mediocrity that we have today because readers want to be catered to like little babies. Readers are few and lazy today. None of them want to really be challenged. Thus what is ok passes for quality because the lame mainstream readers out there demand to not have their boats rocked except moderately. It is the low intelligence of readers that have given us the minimal fare quality of creativity that is written today."
"I thought this was a bad book. The characters are one-dimensional (you can sum up all of them in one or two words) and the plot was pretty predictable and tedious. The characters do the same thing over and over and the dialogue repeats itself (""you have to stop this""). The way the author uses multiple narrators should provide more depth and intrigue than it actually does, since quite often it turns into each character saying more or less the same thing about the same incident.I know this book is a huge hit and now a movie starring the lovely Emily Blunt. I can't say I really know why. However, I did learn that one can buy gin and tonic in a can in the UK. On some things it really does seem like the Brits have things figured out."
Hummmmmm. So many with the same title. Confusing and all the back many forth from one character to another.  I read it because of the movie....I like the UK setting and have been on the train...... a bit disappointed in this but stayed with it even though I had it figured out.
"If you're looking for one of those mystery novels that leaves you in suspense for the sake of loving the characters, then don't read this. Too often, people pass up good novels or, as seen out here, condemn a good work because the characters are either not relatable or not what they wish they could relate too. Paula Hawkins does a great job in presenting a cast of characters that are flawed and present us with a sense of real life depression. Girl on the Train is often compared to Gillian Flynn's novels like Gone Girl. The difference between the two is that Flynn deliberately presents the reader with characters that are the dregs of society living in the bleakest of circumstances. Hawkins is less severe.With Girl on the Train, you get to know the murderer nearly from the first chapter. She cleverly hands the information to the reader and then equally cleverly expects you to dismiss it. And you will. You get to meet the three graces: Rachel, Anna and Megan. Each presents the story from her point of view. Rachel is the main character who's a seriously disturbed alcoholic with blackouts that start the mystery. Oddly, I found Rachel to be the only character worth knowing and caring about and most of that comes from her confusion as to who she is. You meet Megan next who struggles with sexual boundaries, or more likely borderline personality disorder. She's our lovely victim....and you won't care. Then you meet Anna who has supplanted Rachel in the heart of Tom, former husband, for supposedly being a better choice. Some people have suggested that Anna became pregnant and that's why Tom left Rachel but the timeline doesn't fit. Anna, just happens to be the narcissist who warps reality to fit her needs no matter how ridiculous.So with our three graces come all their flaws, a murder, odd characters hovering on the edges and something not quite right seen through Rachel's eyes. Though condemned for her lack of reliability and serious issues with judgment, Rachel actually does some extraordinary things which made me care. I won't say more other than this is worth reading, if you're a deep person and like to explore the possibility of ""what if this were me?"" If not, don't bother."
"I bought this book mainly because it had been #1 NYTimes best-seller.  Big mistake.  I regret the time I wasted reading it.The vast majority of the plot energy centers around the female protagonists triumphantly discovering, verifying, agonizing over, and obsessing over the infidelity of their husbands. There is not one word about any attempts to solve problems or make a better marriage. There is not one word about the good side of any marriage.. On the contrary,If this bleep is to be believed, the only propose of marriage is lose-lose to give e the wife cause to feel bigtime aggrieved.  If that were the case, women's best course would always be to avoid marriage altogetherThat said, Hawkins weaves  in a powerful and non-preachy.anti-alcohol subtext.  If this book saves one young woman from life-destroying ravages of drink, that would be terrific.  But a good read it is not."
"First off, I think there is somewhat of a ""herd"" mentality in the overall negative ratings by some reviewers of this book. With that off my mind...I see real value in the epiphanies each of the three female characters experienced within the unfolding of the story.Rachel literally rides the train and, to my interpretation, is  also, figuratively riding the train of alcoholism leading to some serious self delusion. She blames the failure of her marriage entirely on herself and carries the burden of the resultant guilt. She never saw her husband clearly. While riding the train into London everyday she invests emotional attachment to a young couple she observes in a house she passes everyday...so much so... she bestows upon them her own made-up names. Events in her own life and in the lives she is observing conspire to literally and figuratively make her get off the train. These events are suspenseful and make for a great storyline. Both Anna and Megan each have different self discoveries. The male characters do not seem to evolve and if anything, each one you meet shares culpability in the main event of the book.  Particularly odious to me (and he is written to actually smell bad) is Scott for his hyper aggressive selfish character; his bullying and his assault of Rachel. Just a personal observation and opinion.Careful reading of this book will yield many clever literary devices. The fact that there is not one smile described as genuine from joy at its root in the whole book.""Everything about him is warm—his hands, his eyes, his voice—everything but the smile. You can see the killer in him when he shows his teeth.""Another is the symbolism behind the small pile of rocks in the corner of Megan and Scott's garden.It is not written as an intense suspense narrative with accelerated pacing and should not be compared with such.  It is written more like a jigsaw puzzle with the pieces to the puzzle locked inside the seemingly blackout mind of the ""Girl on the Train"".  For a satisfying literary and emotional experience and challenge, I highly recommend this book."
"I picked up this book because I saw previews for the movie coming out. With it coming out soon, I burned through the book in a couple of sittings to keep it fresh in my mind. It was a pretty good read for me. The quality of writing is perfectly fine – never felt confused about what the author was trying to convey. The plot leaves a little to be desired. I think my liking of the book is somewhere between “its okay” and “I like it”. My main issues with the story are as follows:1. The book doesn’t really get into the meat of the story until about halfway. I kept waiting for something to happen but it always seemed to be coming eventually.2. The book is only told from the POV of the women – Rachel, Megan, and Anna. Tom, Scott, and to a lesser extent Megan’s shrink, do not get a chapter to themselves. I assume this is done because if they had, there would be no mystery. I’m not sure if this is lazy writing, but it certainly makes the narrative a little biased.3. The author spends the entire book basically saying that the killer can’t possibly be a certain character and then at the end of the book – SURPRISE! – it is. That is not really a twist by my definition.4. When you do find out who the killer is, everything wraps up in the last 20 pages and the story is over. I wasn’t expecting any sort of slasher killer fake ending with the murderer constantly popping up, but after the reveal the book just rockets to the end and doesn’t let anything sink in for the reader.Despite the issues I had, I still enjoyed reading the book and would recommend it. It is interesting to read from Rachel’s POV because you can see her mind unravel at times and you can’t trust some things she says. Give it a read, or maybe just check out the movie, but don’t expect it to change your life."
"I have mixed feelings about this book. It was good, but it wasn't quite as good as I expected based on all the hype. The writing style was pretty straight forward and simple. In many people's opinion, simple writing is better and it certainly stayed away from the purple prose. So it points for that. Still it wasn't beautifully written. The story was told from the viewpoint of three female characters and it is a murder mystery sort of novel. Much of the book deals with characters reflecting back while not being able to piece together who committed the murder. The book isn't very long and is a book that someone can read fairly quickly. I like books that I can read in a night, so this is a plus to me. At times it felt like the book was dragging though as it kind of left us wondering without much movement in the plot. Since the main event already happened, there was a lot of /waiting to find out/ about the storyline. The main character (the girl on the train) was a decent character.  Rachel is an alcoholic with blackouts, an inability to have children and at her core a heart of gold. The story was also written from the viewpoint of Anna, the more slender, more beautiful and more fertile girl who hooked up with Rachel's husband while they were still married and later married him herself. Anna is sort of the typical /bitchy other woman/ who eventually admits that didn't really care that she taking a married man. The story was also told from the viewpoint of a the pretty blonde Megan who cheats on her husband and has a troubled past. The female characters were interesting. The book goes into the nature of a manipulative relationships and could be a helpful read to woman who have gone through domestic violence or tend to fall for bad guys."
"I had added ""Girl On a Train"" to my summer reading list, and was anxious to start it.  It was high on my list - right after Orphan Train and All the Light We Cannot See. I had no preconceived ideas about it and did not know the story line. Given the number of great reviews, I was pretty shocked when I was halfway through it and simply not engaged. I could have put it down and not returned to it. I get the theme of ""these-characters-aren't-who-you-think-they-are"", but how many chapters of the main character's obsessive screw ups, alcoholism, mental instability,  and self-loathing do we need to witness before thinking the author doubts our comprehension and needs to repeat it for us?For awhile, the most interesting part for me was the momentary supposition that Megan and Rachel were the same person due to MPD - at the same time knowing the impossibility of that considering the cross-over of people in both their lives. By the time the author fleshed out Meghan's background issues - I just didn't care. It had taken too long and I just didn't care to pick up the [new] baggage of Meghan's self-loathing after spending half the book watching Rachel embrace her pathetic-ness.I don't know if one would consider it a ""disclaimer"" but I have a degree in Criminology, so I may be more pragmatic in my attitude. I read a lot of mystery/thrillers and feel I am easily engaged and don't tend to over criticize.With that said, (and trying to avoid spoilers) - I thought the perpetrator was obvious early on, based on actions and history......not conversation and pretenses.  And come on - the ""nanny scenario??""  Seriously""Normally, in a thriller or mystery I really like - the characters are woven with a complexity that involves me. Later on, it should be a surprise regarding who they really are. Quite simply - I didn't want to know any of these people."
"Whenever each of us reads a book, consciously - or unconsciously -  our reactions to the story, the characters, the writing  all affected by what we  to the story. My own reading experience was quite disturbing, so much so that the psychological, emotional abuse of my past marriage was triggered in ways that stunned and frightened me.  Proust was either lucky or fanciful with the charming memories triggered by his famous madeleine cookies.  This novel is suspenseful and fast paced.  It is also a subtle and complex story about women -  women's experiences and desires within the context of Western culture: how women live with men - or ,in this story, a man - about how we come to believe ""truths"" about ourselves.  The story can be read in many ways: suspenseful murder mystery; fast paced psychological mystery; and also as a story about a complex main character -  weak  and unlikeable when first introduced - and her relationships within the other women's stories.  As this tale is unwoven by the author, we find the main character caught up in a plausible tale about the fallout from lies and the (too often invisible) psychological and emotional abuse women endure silently, frequently without self-awareness, leaving these characters with few skills to ""see"" the truth.  Highly recommend."
"It's been a long time since I've been able to finish a book because the author seems to lose me in the middle--if not at the beginning. This one though, kept me hooked til the end! Can't wait to see the movie, by I can't imagine it topping the book."
This is my first read from this author. It was an awesome book! The story kept me in suspense until the very last page. It was completely unpredictable. Can't wait to see the movie coming out Oct 7th!
"Great suspense story, slightly better than the movie.  It is now a movie which I found a little confusing on the characters.  I believe the book helps clarify the ambigusness."
"I was very disappointed. I read the reviews and thought from the ratings this was a safe bet. After completing the long and dreary story I felt the reviewers who believed this to be a great thriller really haven't read one. Sorry, but this story did nothing for me except wear me out. Very repetitive..."
"Knock off of, ""Gone Girl,"" except not as good. The description of the book sounded so good! And it got such great reviews. The book was written okay, however I couldn't invest myself in the characters and was often confused as I often felt like I missed something because information was left out. The main character isn't likeable which made the book even worse. Waste of time."
"This book proved to be aggravating, confusing, and frustrating, but also riveting, enjoyable, suspenseful, and enticing; well worth the time and effort. I recommend this highly. It is a book that requires you to question everything. It kept me guessing for a long time."
This is one of the best books I've read in a very long time. The story is engaging and the writing is excellent taking the reader on a train ride to an exciting and thrilling conclusion leaving the reader will a hopeful outlook for Rachel and Anna.
"I tried to read it twice. It was not enjoyable. Frustrating, couldn't follow her. I wonder if the girl had dual personalities. maybe."
The book has a good start.  But 3/4 of the way into the book I knew where it was headed. The ending was so/so
"AMAZING read! I was looking for a good ""grabber"" book - one that you start reading and it pulls you in - and I found it with the Girl on the Train! I think of this as a combo of Gone Girl and The Husband's Secret. Both great reads, adding this one to my recommendation list."
"Very poorly written, confusing, and literally a waste of my time.  Difficult to distinguish individual characters in the story.  So bad that I continued to read in hopes that it had to improve .... did not."
"Couldn't put it down, however I was hoping for something a little more compelling toward the end. The fact that all three women were somewhat submissive and weak made me feel some sort of way."
"After seeing over 50,000 good reviews, I thought I would love this book. I didn't. I read a lot of books and I give out a lot of recommendations. I do not recommend this one."
"Took this book on vacation, and couldn't put it down until I finished it. Seldom does one get a mystery / thriller with action on every page, with engaging dialog on the non-physical chapters. Loved the book!"
"""The Girl on the Train"" is an excellent read! I love it when I don't see the twists coming, and this novel is full consists of twists and a totally unexpected ending! If you're a fan of ""Gone Girl"" you will love this novel!"
"Rachel Watson lives a sad life. Her marriage fell apart, she drinks, and fantasized about a ""perfect couple"" she sees on her train ride. But this couple is not perfect as she thought. If you love, Gone Girl, you will enjoy the twist in this book."
"As much as the book was interesting, I have to say I just really didn't like it."
This was a great story though some parts are hard to read. The construction of the story keeps things interesting and makes for a quick read.  Good characters and a good twist at the end.
Clearly a great read. Looking for something that resembles another book? Gone Girl? I would recommend this to the Gone Girl fan or anyone that wants to have a treat for the eyes to read..!
All the hype on this book this year that perhaps that created my disappointment. Though good and finally half way thru it did grab my interest. Yet still a let down.
More about girl talk and alcohol and less about suspense! It became boring and I lost interest. It was easy to know who killed Megan.
This book was just the right combination of thrilling and reality.  I loved the sub plots of the characters as the narration shifted.  The characters are relatable and the story moves at a nice place.  I will be reading more by this author.
Took some time to untangle characters and story line but was a good read.
"It was a bit short and too fast. But the suspense was well worth it!  I found the characters well narrated during their own POV as well, the surroundings descriptive."
"Interesting style but used to the point of the story being over-written, over complicated, and self indulgent."
"It was an engaging read.  Not fabulous in terms of literary ability or even plot, but it kept me reading until the end."
"I see a lot of bad reviews but I don't know why, this was a great book! I decided i would read the book before watching the movie and I'm glad I did. The book was WAY better! This is a real page turner, I could have read it in one day if I wasn't so busy!"
"I love a good mystery. I really can't remember one like this of all the hundreds I've read that used alcohol and alcoholism in this way. I thought the merger of this and also the conflicting  relationships secrets people hide and also find out about people they never suspected was very intriguing. I did guess correctly but did have my doubts and second guessed myself due to the creative writing and the excellent drama created. I would highly recommend this book. I also listened to a portion of it and loved the main character's narrator. The other one was good for that person, as well. But I am so glad she wasn't the main reader and was that way for a reason because when people talk like that for a whole story I just start to feel extremely awful. As in bored and anxiously so.The subject of domestic abusive was dealt with relatively well. Some really enlightening segments, which is always good."
Actually liked the movie better.  I think movie did a better job of explaining how rachel didn't remember the past because of all the lies she was told.
"Absolutely captivates the reader into the story, submerged in intense emotional angst of multiple characters which initially seems entwined only within the imagination of a single soul.  Absolute must read."
"I'm not understanding why this is getting such high reviews, let alone made into a movie - a train wreck of a book, where is the editing?  It starts off okay but towards the middle there's so much repetition that a good 50+ pages could have been cut out that would have improved the story.  The girl on the train, Rachel, is an alcoholic and watches a couple on her commute who live on the same street she previously did with her ex husband.  When the woman in the couple goes missing she tries to figure out what happened, and if she was nearby that night due to her continued stalking of her ex hubby.  We get repeated mentions of:- let's call my hubby to help me remember (3-4 times), or just showing up on the street multiple times- going to the underpass beneath the train tracks (3x or so)- trying to find another commuter who interacted with her that night (3-4 times)- trying to contact the husband of the missing women, stalking him tooIt improves toward the end, when we finally don't have the repeated chapters over and over again. The characters were all unlikable, with Rachel being one of the most annoying ever created - found myself almost wishing something would happen to her."
"Based on the numerous positive reviews, I was all ready to thoroughly enjoy this book.  The reviews imply plot-twists and edge-of-your-seat reading.  However, I found myself continuing to read for one simple reason:  I was waiting for the big twist or turn or to be completely thrown.  It never came.  I surmised the major plot twist about 1/3 of the way through the book, but kept thinking I might be missing something.  I wasn't.  As other reviewers have stated, the characters are mildly likeable but tend to border more on the annoying.  Their lives, as described by the three various narrators, were uninteresting.  There were many parts of the narrations that could have gone in a compelling direction and would draw you in, but those tangents were often simple, short and left you feeling as if the book was written simple to get to the end.  It was an okay read - definitely a sit by the beach to read the mundane type of book."
"Interesting premise, decent execution. A refreshing change to have 3 main female protagonists who all have warts (although nothing in comparison to the males). The ""multiple viewpoint first person"" narrative (I'm sure there's a more technical literary name for this) is an interesting conceit but a bit confusing at first. In my view, the  story could have been told just as effectively by only two of the 3 narrators. Also one thing that gets missed in this format is any broader descriptive detail and explicit point of view on the evolution of modern British suburban society that lends itself to the rise of twits like these people (since only one of the 3 female narrators --and none of their 2 dimensional male counterparts--will admit to being twits as part of their narrative)The story itself could actually take place anywhere; needn't have been the Home Counties in the UK. However, compared to the mindlessness of the post-yuppie suburban twits we have in the US, these UK versions are pretty soft-edged, maybe even tolerable neighbors. Maybe I'll emigrate.The intersection of the personal narrative of the ""main"" protagonist and the mystery she's drawn into means there are inevitable missed turns on the plot roadmap. At one point I was flipping back through earlier pages thinking I'd either missed something or had inherited the heroine's propensity for drunken blackouts. Had this been a movie we would've commented ""hmmm, guess the last half of THAT plot line ended up on the cutting room floor.""All that aside, this was a decent read and a good diversion. I look forward to reading her next effort. also look forward to what I assume will be the inevitable film version of ""girl on a train"", which I think could actually rectify some of the plotting and narrative blind spots of the book. ) This book is being marketed as ""the next Gone Girl"", but in the right hands, I think a film version of this book could be so much stronger than Gone girl, which I thought had all the predictability of ritual Kabuki theater but with a suspenseful soundtrack."
"I was looking for another great thriller after loving Gone Girl, and since this was just released as a feature film I wanted to read the book before I see the movie. Unfortunately I did not feel that it lived up the hype. Not a single one of the characters is very likeable, so it's hard to care about what about happens to them, or feel invested in the story. For a split second (about 3/4 of the way through the book), it got interesting and the mystery started to feel intriguing, but after all the build-up the final few chapters flew by fairly predictably.There is a lot of flipping back and forth between the characters telling the story, which was kind of similar to Gone Girl, but each section is written in the same style so it doesn't really seem like you're reading another person's perspective. And each section is dated, again copied from Gone Girl, but many of them are out of sequence so I found myself flipping back several times to figure out the timeline.All in all, it was just okay. I didn't love it, didn't hate it. And I don't have much of a desire to see the movie anymore."
"I'm not sure how many stars to give this book.  It is ""very British"" meaning not an American voice, references that resonate with UK citizens made me look up words.Perhaps the fact that I am American, pragmatically American, I did not connect with any of the characters. Not even the baby was described in a way that made me smile; whining, grizzing, no cooing or cuddles really.The characters are self involved and yet not evolved as human beings, which, I suppose is usually the case.The mystery is very good.  It is a true twisting tale of human craziness.  Maybe like the classic Of Human Bondage.Upon reading the last page, I felt sad, not hopeful. I don't think that the character arc was complete but as this is a mystery,perhaps it is keeping in its kind.The other thing that I thought was,""this author is messed up."". But I am middle aged, not raised in the cable tv extremes that millennials, etc have been inured to since birth.  The way that it s written is new, the myriads of relationships:ancient.This book is timeless and brutal, perhaps in the end, there is hope."
"I read this book with my book club. I was intrigued by the promise of unreliable narrators, because they are a weakness of mine. If you don't care for those, or feel cheated or lied to when you read that sort of thing, you'll want to skip this one. I was also interested by people comparing the author to Gillian Flynn. There are definite similarities. I think if you like one,  you'll like the other.I suppose this book would be considered a psychological thriller, Or a murder mystery, but I'm not very good at identifying the right categories for these things. I do recall, after years of watching shows like Bones and Monk, that you can identify the killer by spotting the unnecessary character. In those TV shows, that always works. In this book, I thought I had done that, but it turned out I was wrong. And I was pleased by the red herring. Again, unreliable narrators make that difficult to find. So, don't expect this to be easy to figure out right away.The story is very dark. I think it manages to be less dark than Gillian Flynn's books, but not by much. There are three narrators. Rachel is who I would consider to be the main character. She is a divorcee with a drinking problem, prone to drunken blackouts, unable to remember what happens during them. She's also one of the only likable characters in the book. With all of her flaws she still manages to be sympathetic. It can be hard for the reader not to root for her, even while cringing at a lot of her choices.The book was engaging from the very beginning, with the story drawing you in and keeping you there, because you'll want to know what happens next. I highly recommend it.  Thoughts of a nerdy feminist read"
"I have to say that it was a wonderful book. I was kept on the edge of my seat the whole time. I didn't try to think ahead I just went with the flow as I believe the author wished for me. People in reviews said the were confused but that shouldn't have been necessary. After a few pages you get them etched in your mind so vividly. I am 70 so my memory really isn't that good, so at first I wrote the characters names down and a bit of a description of them. I referred to it after I was forced to put my book down and do some dang work. I would quickly review my notes and just like that I was back into my story. ( I. Loved. Every. Moment. Of. This. Book.)  Any resemblance to Gone Girl is silly. That book had a stupid ending.  I don't have a single complaint about the story. I do have a complaint about the people here telling too many details about the story. I stayed away on purpose because I knew they would ruin the story for me.Paula, you wrote a fabulous story and it was way more satisfying than Gone Girl could have hoped to have been. I will miss the thrill of having this book to read.................what am I going to do with myself. Any book I pick up will pale in comparison!!"
"It’s hard to be objective about a novel that strives so determinedly (and successfully) to make its characters as unlikable as those in Paula Hawkins’ bestselling mystery, “The Girl On the Train”. With not one, but three, unreliable narrators jumping back and forth in time offering first-person perspectives on unfolding events, the book chronicles the intertwined stories of sad-sack drunkard, Rachel, the titular girl on the train; Megan, the secretive blonde half of a seemingly perfect couple Rachel spies on from the train; and Anna, a hard-edged suburbanite who envisions herself as the perfect wife and mother.The central mystery begins when one of the women goes missing.The main narrative, necessarily, comes from Rachel, still wallowing in booze and self-pity years after her husband left her for the younger, prettier Anna. In fact, Anna, the usurper, and Rachel’s ex-husband are still living in the same house that once belonged to Rachel. Having lost her job due to drunkenness, Rachel still takes the train each day from the suburbs into London, not only to make her sober-minded roommate think she’s still gainfully employed, but also to keep an eye on her ex and the woman occupying her old home; the train just happens to pass right by the place. A few doors down lives a beautiful young couple whom Rachel also watches, becoming a little too fascinated by their lives lived largely out in the back yard and through open windows. Although Rachel nicknames them Jess and Jason and envies what she perceives to be their idyllic wedded bliss, it soon becomes apparent that appearances are deceiving, especially after she witnesses a shocking act that shakes up her vicarious fantasy life. But, did she, in fact, see what she thought she saw? Rachel’s reality is blurred from heavy drinking which often results in blackouts; her problems are compounded by her stalking of not only her ex-husband, Tom, and his increasingly agitated wife, but of Scott and Megan, the real-life “lovebirds” Rachel knows as Jess and Jason. What follows is a harrowing, sometimes confusing yarn that allows for no “good guys” and sees Rachel making one misstep after another after another until finally, I lost patience with her to the point that I found it difficult to finish the book. A main character doesn’t necessarily have to be likable, or even relatable, to maintain a good story but they should offer up something—sympathy, grudging admiration, even hatred—to keep the reader hooked in to that character, to want to know what happens to him or her. Rachel used up what sympathy I had for her very quickly, and while I didn’t like her at all, I didn’t dislike her enough by the end to care what happened to her. By the time she finally rallies from her downtrodden hangdog state, it was too little, too late; I simply didn’t care. However, being very familiar with the behavior of alcoholics, I did find Rachel’s behavior to be believable (for the most part), if tiring.The character of Megan was more interesting, and perhaps, more sympathetic. With dark secrets in both her past and present, Megan is a well-structured character who is damaged and self-destructive, not a nice woman but not someone who is intentionally cruel. Her own missteps, more dramatic than Rachel’s (at least early on), are poignant and truly heartbreaking, and while the character of Rachel is the protagonist of the story, it is Megan who really drives it.Anna, the third voice in “Girl On the Train”, is probably the least developed of the three narrators. Presented as a vain, calculating homewrecker whose deeds are doubling back on her, Anna is something of a narcissist, who is, understandably, at the end of her rope with Rachel and her attendant drama. Anna considers herself to be clear-headed and sane compared to the other female characters in the novel, although her narcissism precludes her from seeing that she’s as deluded as they are.The problem I found with having three narrators is that their voices begin to seem strangely similar as one chapter featuring Anna flows into the next chapter, narrated by Rachel, and so on. If Rachel isn’t on a drunken binge, it’s difficult to separate her musings from those of Anna; in more than one instance, I found myself thumbing back to the beginning of a chapter to see if it was titled “Rachel”, “Anna” or “Megan”.The men in the story are also difficult to separate in some instances, and even more sketchily written than Anna. Tom, Anna’s husband and Rachel’s ex, is very much like Scott, Megan’s husband, and neither seems to be all that distinctive. There’s also a shady psychiatrist on hand who doesn’t seem to balk at bedding his patients, and a couple of cops who never come to life, existing merely as words on a page. Of course, they’re an awkward necessity in moving the story forward (and in offending Rachel).Also awkward is the fact that characters narrate events in the present, often simultaneously with a different character in the following chapter, while another character narrates events from months, or years, earlier. Again, it’s a necessity in moving the story forward (and in tying up all the loose ends) but it feels awkward. The solution to the mystery, when it comes, isn’t surprising but it is serviceable and doesn’t insult the reader’s intelligence.As trying as I often felt “The Girl On the Train” to be, it does offer up some suspense, and isn’t altogether horrible. Paula Hawkins writes well and I hope she’ll up her game on her next literary outing."
"Maybe it's because I've read so many books of this type, but I found the story to be predictable, and the ending was not a surprise for me.Additionally, I did not find the characters to be all that likable.  Rachael comes across as a sloth.  Megan reads as a self-centered, conniving, bish, although she has a revelation of such profound and utter sadness that my heart sank to the pit of my stomach for several hours (getting into a book brings the characters alive for me; they are temporarily people that 'I know').  Anna both revels in gloating satisfaction and plays the weak victim at the same time.  Cathy is a roommate with a level of patience that doesn't seem believable.  Tom and Scott, even when they aren't doing anything 'wrong', both seem like condescending jerks to me.I feel like I am 'supposed' to like this book, because someone liked it well enough to turn it into a major motion picture, but I can't quite give it a glowing review.I will say that the author did a decent job of keeping the twists and turns easy enough to follow.  The story was 'okay'.  I'm glad I read it, but it didn't stand out as a read above the rest."
"The reader becomes a voyeur into the life of a voyeur. The characters in this book are definitely out of the norm (I hope), each with some serious problems and some extreme behaviors. There is an air of mystery as I was almost reluctantly drawn into the story, wanting to know more about these creepy people and to learn what had actually happened to them, as the story unfolds from different perspectives. It would be impossible to lump any character into a category of either ""good"" or ""bad,"" as (with all humans) each is a complex combination of both. All seem to be in need of a trusted friend,partner and/or counselor. But wait! These needs are being met by those types of people throughout the book - or are they? Is anyone truly worthy of trust? (Note: The sex and violence is not explicit.)"
"Really having a hard time getting into,this!!! I usually canjumpy around in books ...not this for some reasonDid not see movie yet"
"How boring and cliche. These days, the hand that rocks the publishing cradle is the extra money in the bank just about anyone who is on the bestseller list has to drink coffee at bourgeois cafes whilst waiting for heir manuscript to be picked up and published. Barf."
"I usually read thrillers , suspense, fast-paced who done-it's. Even though this was different somehow, it was still a great read. A page-turner. Love the style this book was written. Anxiously look forward to the next!"
So many twists and turns it's hard to keep them straight. None of the characters in this book are particularly likeable or sympathetic but I could not put it down.
"I had high hopes for this book, however I was very disappointed with the way characters developed and how some parts of the book that were made to seem important were never brought back up. I would not recommend."
"I read the bulk of this book in one day, because I couldn't put it down.I had known beforehand, from reading other people's reviews, that all of the characters were going to be loathsome and unreliable-- This is true and still, I think it adds to the story. You never know who to trust and you have to take each character's story with a grain of salt. For me that made the mystery more fun, like I was a third detective in the novel trying to figure out the puzzle.I guessed who the killer was about 2/3's of the way through the book but feeling like I had solved the case didn't ruin the unfolding of the rest of the story for me. There was still enough doubt in the back of my mind that took me through to the end.This was a fast-paced read that had a lot of twists and turns. I really enjoyed it and look forward to reading more mysteries like this in the future."
"A really good Psychological thriller. About an alcoholic that thinks she knows what happens to a married woman that comes up missing. But, she was drunk and can't be sure. Hawkins does a great job of weaving in each of the main characters to the story.An ex-husband his new wife and child, another married man who's wife comes up missing and that the main character thinks she may have feeling for him. And this kind, gentle and mysterious Doctor. The one the missing wife is seeing. So what happen? where is she? and who did it?"
This read was not the type of book I usually read. It was exciting near the end. A little slow in the beginning. It did keep you guessing.
Enjoyed reading this book.  Lots of interesting characters and unexpected turns.  I can't wait for the movie to come out and see how it plays out on screen.
"Reading the ""girl on the train"" was intriguing to say the least, seeing someone go through life believing that they are no good until they found out things were not what they seem to be. Now take Rachel for instant, going around letting everyone think she had a job, traveling on a train every single day, just to keep herself amused not sure; however she got herself into something that led to her finding out the man she married was pure evil and would go as far as killing someone to keep his secret. This was a good thriller to say the least, pretty good read."
"The novel pulled me into its sinister plot by the second chapter.  It twisted and turned and then twisted again, finally spitting me out at the end.  A most enjoyable read."
Enjoyed the book and I plan on watching the movie. Books are usually better than the movies by far hope I'm not disappointed.
"What an unfolding... Gripping, turning, a master story telling. You will not be able to put it down! Incredibly powerful"
I just finished it...Want a book you can't put down? Read This!!!I have not had a great book to read in a long time.
"heard this book was good so I'm giving it a good review , I just started reading it and so fat it has a good story line ."
"Really enjoyed this book.  Hard to put down .  Rich characters.  Suspenseful.  Kept me guessing for two thirds of the book and still had doubt till the final reveal.  If you like Gone Girl, give this a try."
The story around the main character is rather despairing at times even though she becomes the heroine in the end. Did not keep the book in my library after reading. Gave it away to the library.
"I found myself wanting to be able to put things aside in order to get back to reading this book. I wanted to know more about the characters, and found myself suspecting each one in turn. I didn't want to put this one down."
Great book with well developed characters. I wish there was one male that could have been a role model.  It's almost like the person who wrote it sees all men as cruel and uncaring of women.
"What a great read! I couldn't put it down, didn't want to! So many twists and turns with quite a surprise ending! A wonderful murder mystery!!!"
"I did not go and see the movie because I  wanted to read the book and I 'my glad I did.  There is nothing like the images of the characters and the settings in your own mind to carry you through the story.  Despite  knowing that Emily Blount played the lead, I  was able to image Rachel in another way.  And, unfortunately, in my opinion, despite Ms. Blount being very attractive, I don't  believe from what I saw from the trailer, she could have accurately portrayed Rachel totally.  However, what I enjoyed about this author's style is that she captured what I feel  is essential to writing mysteries:  make every word and story element count!!  The reader wants to collect information about people, places and things.  We don't like unnecessary story angles that go on and on or ridiculous love stories that have no bearing on the case.  The odd red herring or sexual tension here or there is fine, but be about the story or we lose interest and on to the bookshelf or to the yard sale you go."
I was so disappointed in this book; I had heard rave reviews about it was excited to start reading.  By the fourth chapter I had already mentally checked out and felt the characters were extremely transparent and Rachel's character was exhausting.  It read like a hurriedly written young-adult novel.  Not sure who is giving this book five stars but I wouldn't even give it one unless Amazon told me I had to pick at least a star to write a review.
"I do find myself agreeing with several other readers that the main character was a touch difficult to connect with. At least at first.As the story unfolded and the end grew ever closer, it became clear why she'd fallen into her drinking habits and why her life was such a mess.However, I will say that if you've spent as much time reading these sorts of thrillers and studying them as I have, you may not be quite as shocked at the big reveal as others. I had it figured out several chapters ahead of time, but reading the characters reactions was still enjoyable.Overall, a fairly decent thriller!"
This is one of the worst books I've ever read. The movie makers had to introduce another whole character to explain the plot in this book. I can't believe it was on the NY Times Best Seller list.  That doesn't say much for the NY Times.
"predictable plot, I accurately selected the killer while only 50% through the book. Waited to maybe be surprised or be proven wrong - nope :( ..... everything as I suspected. Not very mind stimulating mystery story. If you have nothing to read at the moment go for it, but have very low expectations. Because of simple scenario and easy to read characters I do not see how they will make a good movie out of it."
"This is the story of three awful women.  If they formed a support group and if support groups had mottoes, I suggest that theirs would be “I needed this, so I gave myself permission to take it.”  And what do awful women end up with if not awful husbands and boyfriends?This novel is in epistolary form, except that chapters are in the form of morning and evening diary entries instead of letters.  In addition, the chapters aren’t in chronological order.  So one woman’s narrative is followed in the next chapter by another woman’s narrative from a year earlier.  It was a little confusing at first, but it wasn’t hard to get the hang of it.Rachel, the protagonist, is the most well-developed and interesting character.  In addition, the scenes are sketchy.  But in every other respect, what the writer does for the beginning two-thirds of the book, exhibits a mastery of detail and pacing, particularly in Rachel’s narrative as she makes her way in these urban and suburban settings.  These chapters have fine literary qualities, enticing the reader to continue.However, the writer doesn't smoothly integrate this literary first part of the novel with the overall detective mystery orientation.  The last third of the book (the “caboose”, let’s say) becomes a regular mystery story, written in more of a mass-market paperback style, but the first part makes it all worthwhile.As we gradually discover more and more about Rachel, some readers might find it depressing.  Without giving too much away, here’s something to help you hang in there.  Rachel’s second worst vice, her lack of respect for boundaries, is what keeps her from succumbing to her worst and most deadly vice.This is not a good gift for the younger kids.  There’s cursing, gruesome violence andheavy drinking.2.88 stars"
"I hated the book. How much? Well, this book pissed me off because I just couldn't finish the damn thing. I read about 45% of it and put it down for a few weeks hoping I could start it fresh and become more engaged in the story than I was during the first half. I was irritated because I have rarely walked away from even the most boring, tedious tale.I'm a reader, 60, educated and a male. This doesn't put me in the target audience. But I could have enjoyed the ride if it just moved along a little or if ALL the characters weren't petty, self absorbed basket cases. Their responses to what befalls them each individually seems trite and/or illogical to a fault. I wanted to throw the Kindle across the room as Rachel stumbles along on what is either a quest to solve a mystery or a road to redemption. That was about 70% of the way through the book. But the straw that broke the camel's back came when I realized that we're getting narration of past events from a character whom, by all rights, shouldn't be able to do that. And that's as close to a spoiler as I'm willing to get.Obviously I'm in a minority group of dissenters here and granted. For the folks that love this story, more power to you, your money was well invested. Also, I'll grant the writer due credit for skill in structure and character development but I found the whole thing boring, boring and a snooze. I had no sympathy or empathy for a single character in this book. Nasty, nasty people with nary a redeeming quality between them. If they were at least interesting..."
"I'm not certain why this book has been compared to Gone, Girl.  To me, it was written very differently and outside of a woman being missing and the husband being a suspect, they weren't anything alike in my opinion.This book was picked by my book club and I had a hard time finishing it.  My problem was that I disliked each and every character, but especially the main character, Rachel.  She is a person who makes the same decisions to drink, black out, then wakes up confused but knowing she's ""done something bad"".  She phones her ex husband on a regular basis, drunk, crying and/or  harassing he and his wife; she sponges off her roommate who for some reason puts up with her drinking and passing out constantly.  Rachel goes through a repetitious cycle of drinking, blacking out and waking up knowing she has ""done something bad"".  The thing is, she makes the same decisions over and over.  I wanted to personally slap her midway through the story and thereafter.  I nearly stopped reading it several times.I could barely get through this book and the only reason I finished it was to find out what actually happened to the missing woman.  Other than that, save your money and get it from the library if you can take reading about characters who are the weakest people you'll ever meet."
"I wish I liked this one more. It is an interesting concept with the alternating chapters between characters, the vague narration, the mystery of a woman's disappearance, the train travel. But for me the good parts did not outweigh the boring or less than stellar parts.My feelings in short: Engaging beginning, boring middle, exciting ending.My main problems were:1. Writing style. It was waaaaaaay too much internal dialogue. Some is totally okay. We all think in our heads or talk to ourselves. But I hate excessive internal dialogue, and in the case of this story it was a lot. So for me, this was a major issue. Now, if you like internal dialogue, you may very well love this book. But I personally need more character interactions; more showing, less telling, please.2. Characters. I also didn't like any of these characters, except for Rachel's roommate (who was dismissed for being nice). Rachel, Anna, and Megan are the narrators, and I found my interest in them waning. Having an alcoholic for a main narrator was interesting to start, then super annoying. Tom and Scott were no better. These people all had issues galore, which usually makes for an intriguing read. But unfortunately, even with their issues, I lost my interest in them.3. Repetitive. I was pretty engaged in the first 30% or so. Basically until I figured out the twist. Then I was waiting for the characters to catch up with me. Then I was bored. It was lie, get drunk, blackout; rinse and repeat. Once I knew what was coming (maybe not the details, but the main idea), I felt like maybe 100 pages of the book could have been removed due to sheer repetitiveness, and it would have been fine with me. Living in an alcoholic haze with Rachel became tedious. The saving grace was the ending. At least it left me on a high note.On the positive side, I read this book for my book club, and I was in the minority on my feelings toward it. The other women either liked or loved it. So this book got a 5/6 approval rating from us. No one else in my book club figured out the twist, either, so they were far more engaged than I was. Perhaps if I hadn't figured out the twist at 30% I would have liked it more, too. Oh well.Would I recommend this book? Sure. If you like a book with mystery and odd characters, and don't mind a lot of internal dialogue, this might just be the book for you."
"This has to be one of the worst books that I have ever read.  It lacks depth, has an under developed plot and characters, is confusing, jumps all over the place, and resembles something that an under performing 7th grader would write.  How it remains on the best seller continues to amaze me.  Very poorly written, a total waste of time to read, (but trust me, it will not take much of your time to read.)  I certainly hope America's interest is such a dime store calamity is not a reflection on the education of the American public.  Take a pass on this one.I've rated it one star which is one star more than it deserves."
This book was good.  Not great. Hard to follow the dates and voices at times.  I wanted to read it before I saw the movie.
Like a UK Gone Girl. Only different.A valid example of why we shouldn't booze it up.And perhaps a bit of why we should.
"Had read a review in a magazine and was looking forward to reading it.  Very suspenseful and reminiscent of ""Gone Girl""  I have recommended it to friends."
Hated it. I couldn't read more than a few chapters. Boring
Excellent thriller. Unexpected final. One of the best books I have ever read. An amazing narrative...I felt every single moment. A must read book...!!!
"I recommend this book the story is unique, gripping and a page turner thriller. Interesting  characters. Life is about perception....the things you imagine and reality. Good read! Go for it."
"Slow moving depressing story, but interesting non the less. Glad they didn't sugar coat the ending."
"I heard the book was as good as Gone Girl,which I read and saw the movie.This book did not disappoint and I look forward to the movie."
Interesting character and development of them. Sometimes a little to much depth going back into the past.  Figured out some parts along the way. Glad I read prior to seeing the movie
I have missed to reading a book that was so intriguing that forced to keep reading. Very well written and incredibly thrilling. I was at the edge of my seat the entire time. Great thriller book!
"The Girl on the Train is a perfect primer for women who still believe the man they fall in love with is responsible for their happily ever after. The story is narrated by three women--Rachel, wife #1, Anna, wife # 2, and Megan, the new prospect. All are involved with one man, Tom, in an overlapping sequence of events. It so happens that Tom is perfect for all three of the women at the beginning of each relationship because he is masterful at giving each what they need. Therefore, each woman fails to see that Tom becomes manipulative and controlling. But as each relationship falters, all three women expect Tom to make it better. Unfortunately for them, Tom's idea of improving a bad relationship is to move on to a new one--which becomes a problem that hits Tom squarely when Megan, the new woman he is involved with, decides to no longer be manipulated. When she threatens to take control from him, life as each woman knew it spirals out of control.This novel is a worthy read because it shows how easy it is for some women to willingly give up control of their happiness to the man who promises them love forever. In the case of the women in this story, their unhappiness involves so much whining and drinking that it's hard to like any of them. However, Rachel does redeem herself when she starts to realize Tom has manipulated her to a level that shows he is dangerous and capable of much worse. Tom is the anatomy of a perfect psychopath, and the author leaves enough unsaid about Tom until the reader puts it all together. This book is a must for women who still believe in the fairy tale prince!"
"I read this book without reading any reviews, because there is always some (selfish) person who gives away too much of the story, or who (selfishly) shares the ending.  So I went in not knowing how the story was narrated or how the dates changed.  This is how I would recommend reading this book.I loved it!Yes, the characters can be frustrating, but I loved how each character stood on their own........until they didn't. I loved how the characters were developed little by little, especially Rachel.  I will say, it took me a few pages to decide I liked the book, but once I got into it, I had a hard time putting it down.  I found I was reading quickly because I needed to see what happened, but then I was going back and re-reading to fully take it all in.  I don't use the Highlight feature on my kindle much, but I used it a lot in this story.When it all starts to come together, when you start to see the time-line connections, when you start to feel like the ending is right around the corner.........it's not, and I loved that!  I am one of those people who watches too many crime dramas and the who-done-it is rarely a surprise, but this book kept me turning the page until all was revealed.  My only complaint about this book might be the somewhat quick wrap-up on the final two or three pages.  I wanted to know more, I wanted to know what happens to them all now.  I didn't want the book to be over."
"Initially I liked this story, but by the end I was frustrated by it.I liked that the main character had built a story around people she sees through the train window and that those stories seem real to her. I like that she comes to realize how off-base her interpretation is. I also liked that she is an unreliable narrator trying to fill in her own story gaps.I was frustrated by several things. First, the chapters alternate between different characters (a style that I am tiring of in novels), but they are also different timelines. Often the chapters were a bit longer, so I didn't always finish my reading section at the end/beginning of a chapter, and when I returned to the story I didn't necessarily remember whose chapter/timeline I was in. And because I was reading on a Kindle, I sometimes had to click-click-click through pages to find that information from the beginning of the chapter (because it wasn't always readily apparent by context).Second, there was a certain point in the novel where the clues culminated in ""whodunit,"" but the character was slow to catch on after that point which I found frustrating.Finally, the ending fell flat to me. The story as a whole seemed to be written in a particular style, but the final scenes were reminiscent of a typical murder/suspense formula.About 2/3 of the way through, I just wanted to get to the end to see how it turned out. Hence, the lower rating.Do I consider it a waste of my time? No, certainly not. Just didn't leave me thinking ""wow."""
"The book is extremely well written. The machinations inside the minds of the characters are fascinating.The deep philological twists and currents of  addiction are splayed open for the reader to view with startling honesty. This book is a deep look inside the mind of tortured soul, all wrapped up in a fairly complex mystery. Now for why I took off a star: Without spoiling the plot, I will list 3 reasons: Remember the heroine from the old films who decides she just has to go alone into the dark basement forbidden hidden room on a stormy night... with the power out... with no protection... hearing strange noises...after being threatened...barefoot...in nightgown... Now, imagine the heroine does this over and over again. Really? The book starts off with at a really slow pace and the train only picks up a little speed in the last few chapters.The angst and agony of the tortured soul becomes whining and weak when the 'victim' is caught in a cycle of self destruction. Wash, rinse, repeat. I left my review at 4 stars instead of dropping to 3 was due to the wonderful writing ability of the author, a good mystery, and the half cup of hope tossed into the rinse cycle."
"I read this, mostly, on a plane from Manila to London. I then went on a non-stop bus trip from London to Bath and found the lady in front of me also reading it.  This would seem to indicate that it is an easy read, which it is. Each chapter is devoted to a particular date over a three year period, switching between characters. I read the Kindle version and found it hard to keep track of the dates, although this is a deficiency in the Reader rather than in the Author.  I would have preferred to read the hard copy version for this reason. The story moves smoothly and the author cleverly keeps the reader guessing as to the outcome, although she drops a clue, whether intentional or not, about a quarter of the way from the end.  For this reason I found the last, inevitable, scene somewhat drawn out, but this is a minor quibble only. I have not seen the film but I imagine it makes quite good cinema and/or TV. Highly recommended."
"The girl on the train , Rachel, is depressed, her self esteem is very low , she loses contact with reality and fantasyses. She is lonely but does not look for help.She has a bad relationship with her mother and lies to her.She has never overcome the loss of her husband. She acts on her own while knowing that alcohol blurs her mind. Besides curiosity takes her to interfere into other people's affairs.She misleads the investigation .I found the novel a bit slow , it only accelerates in the last chapters.The characters are dark and full of inner conflicts.Rachel has a very low self esteem, she is depressed and drinks. She has not overcome her marriage failure .She interferes and tries to manage on her own.She is lonely ; even the relationship with her mother is distant.Megan is unhappy and wants to leave everything behind, she even tries a relationship with her psichologist and later we are told that she has had an affair with Tom.She has had a dark past.Anna is also unhappy, has left her job Gallery to look after Evie and is haunted by Rachel stocking her.Later she does no longer trust her husband and she even reads his private mail.Male characters play as second characters , only at the end Tom gives a step ahead.There are no happy characters here.I found it difficult to jump from characters in the different chapters and it tired me a bit.The end was surprising and the rythm accelerated and became attractive."
"I devoured this book in just a few days, which is rare for me these days, but a sure sign that it was good as I could not put it down. It's got a very Gone Girl-esque feel, and until the last few chapters I was totally in the dark as to how the story was going to end (and I only got an idea as to how it would because I cheated and peeked ahead a few chapters one night). Recommend if you enjoy thrillers and suspense novels!"
"Well, I'm just a regular reader, no professional reviewer or anything, but I have a lot to say about this amazing book.This ingenius novel is a fascinating look at how everybody is very different, everybody is a little similar, and those similarities and differences can twist together in amazing ways in the end.The characters are very human, being both likable and, at the same time, people we can't help but look down on.  But the characters' complexity emerges as the book gets further along, so that before you know it, you've been guilty of character assassination when you shouldn't have been.  You've been rooting for things you shouldn't have been.  You've been caught up in things in all the wrong ways.  And it happened to you right under your own nose.This book is a great ride! Twisting, turning, pulling you around.  I am an avid reader, and even I was surprised.By the time the ending is approaching, a moral has actually formed in your mind.  You don't even realize it because you've had such a good time.  But a while after you are done with the book, if you take the time to think about it, it's there.What a great book."
"I did not enjoy this book at all.  Chapters are written from the perspective of one character at a time and the timing jumps all over the place.  The story is told from over the course of 3 years but jumps back and forth during that time and is not well written.  This is not a book that is suspenseful as portrayed by the synopsis.  Things that are mentioned and you think they will play a part in the book just disappear, never to be referenced again.  I had figured out who the bad guy was very early on in the book.  And the main character, Rachel, just makes you want to grab her by the shoulders and shake some sense into her.  If you like to read about weak women that can easily be lead by men, then by all means, read the book.  I read this because it was the choice for the monthly book club that I am a part of - I will now be deleting it from my kindle, never to be read again."
"I didn't know what to expect when I bought this but I knew it was becoming a movie and wanted to read the book first. It is an easy quick read. There are a fair amount of characters and the book is written from the point of view of multiple characters, but it is easily identified who is speaking and it is written chronologically so it is still easy to understand. Some twists, enough to keep you interested and not wanting to put it down. Reminded me of Gone Girl a little bit with the story and the style of writing. I liked it better than Gone Girl for sure, but gone girl was a bit more surprising to me. Overall a good book, nothing that I would list in my top 10 favorites, but I also wouldn't discourage anyone from reading it either. I would recommend reading it before seeing the movie because the book is better (as always) but the movie wasn't bad either. Actually, the acting in the movie was pretty good, the plot in the movie was just different than the book."
"I did not like the book at all...not enough to give it even one star.  Apparently one must give a book one star to be able to offer an opinion.  Something within me compels me to finish any book I begin, just to see when, or if, the story will ever get better.  This one never got better, at least not to me.  Imagine taking a handful of broken characters from an assortment of soap operas and jumbling them together.  This might be the result.  I must look at the publishing house.  I will use extra caution before buying from them again.  I did find this book on a suggested reading list, so someone liked it, but certainly not this reader.  I'm sorry I have nothing good to say...usually there is something good. Afraid I could find nothing good this time.  Sorry...money poorly spent.  My loss."
"I bought several books to get through the summer with. For some reason I kept putting this one at the end of the pile.  When I finally took it out,  I thought it was kind of confusing and depressing at that. All I can say is, hang on and keep reading through about the first 60 pages or so or until you just HAVE to know more about what drives these characters!  There is a lot of internal dialogue that goes on that I would think would be completely missed in the film format. You will get to know what makes these characters tick, which in itself is extremely interesting and entertaining. After you get through the first tough beginning and begin to know who's who in the zoo, prepare not to get any sleep until the story ends. This is where it takes off like a locomotive and twists and turns around every bend. Truly a thriller that makes you hold on and gasp for air! By all means, order directly from Amazon NOW!"
"I must say that the book kept my attention through all the complicated manipulative story line . Though from the beginning I hated Rachel for the boring drunk she was, Megan for the unreliable self occupied deeply disturbed woman she was and Anna for the stupid and immoral person she was. Not to think about the psychopath (ATTENTION, SPOILER!) . That the only interest in life these women had was the love of a man is so sad, are really women like that or is it , as I think, a very cliched and insulting idea of  woman? That the author thinks that these women might be considered ""real"" is very disappointing."
"My first thought after reading this book was “yup, it lived up to the hype”. This is a fantastic debut novel- one that I won’t soon forget. Does it live up to the Gone Girl status? Yes, in a way it does. The story has the same type of unreliable narrator who is suffering from her own problems and us readers don’t know whether to believe her or not. Can we readers guess who is behind Megan’s disappearance? Nope. I wanted to think I knew who did it, but when I really found out I was as shocked as everyone else. This book is awesome, albeit, a bit dark and depressing. I had so many feelings while reading this that my head started to spin! Honestly, if you haven’t picked this one up yet than I implore you to do so. It’s just a very, very, good book! No wonder it got a goodreads award!Anyway, the book is about a woman named Rachel who rides the same commuter train every day. At first I wanted to believe it was because she had to work like everyone else, but I was lead to believe wrong. You see, Rachel is hiding from her demons. She lost her job because she is an alcoholic and is trying to hide this news from her flat mate. It’s crazy how well Rachel is hiding her wrong-doings and I can’t help as a reader feeling a bit bad for her. So what Rachel does on this train (each, and every day) is watch the houses go by. But not only this, she fantasizes about the people who live there. You see, she is already familiar with this neighborhood as she used to live there- with her husband- until he left her for another woman. And stranger things continue to happen- her ex-husband now lives in the same house he shared with her, with the woman he left her for. Pretty twisted if you ask me! Either way, Rachel’s fantasizing, her mixed up emotions for her ex-husband and his new wife, and now a murder mystery begins to plague Rachel’s life. She starts with one bad decision- and her life begins to spin even more out of control than it was previously. Yikes! The happenings in this book are quite unbelievable and twisted.Overall, I loved everything about this book. It’s dark, twisted, depressing, and unique. The author has quite the imagination and she certainly brings it to life in this book. Again, if you haven’t read it than you should! It’s awesome. I can’t wait to see what the author thinks up next!"
"""The Girl on the Train” is a debut psychological thriller by Paula Hawkins who was a journalist for fifteen years before she turned her hand to fiction.  The setting of the novel is in London during the summer told through three female voices: Rachel, Megan and Anna.The protagonist, Rachel Watson is an alcoholic who witnesses a murder while on a commuter train.  However, because of her inability to remember things, her constant blackouts and incapability to separate fact from fiction; makes others not believe that she saw a murder.  Even though she has problems with staying sober and focused, Rachel is persistent in trying to find out what happened and why.I feel this is a good debut book for those that like psychological thrillers.  Ms. Hawkins has a good writing style even though I felt the action did not really take off until about the last 75 pages of the book. My deltas are I hated every character in the book because they seemed to not have any redeeming values and worked hard to hurt everyone they knew.  Furthermore, the story dragged in the middle and the ending seemed a little too pat.Overall, it had a good story line and I felt it may change how we look at the lives of others we encounter daily. I look forward to reading Ms. Hawkins next thriller."
"From page one this book grabbed my attention and held on until the very end. It has been awhile since I read a book this fast. I loved the way it was presented from the points of view of the three female characters. Nothing is quite as it appears. What we perceive from a distance can be very different from the reality. I was drawn into the complex lives of each of these women and ultimately how they were all connected. The fact that the story is somewhat dark and moody only made it more intriguing for me. I loved the writing, the depth of the female characters, especially Rachel, and how easily I could ""see"" each scene in my mind. Having heard mixed reviews about this book, I didn't rush to read it, but scenes from the newly released movie made me curious and I heard that some liked the movie better than the book. Needless to say now that I read and loved the book, I definitely want to see the movie. One of the best well-written books I have read in quite awhile."
"I read this book in almost a matter of hours. I became interested when I saw that this book would be made into a movie, and when I heard from friends how great and thrilling it was. I love reading, but I am a very visual person and if the words don't make me feel like I am actually there, experiencing everything like I was actually there, I have a harder time getting through. I was on the edge of my seat, and my heart ached for the main character... couldn't he see what he was doing to her? Why didn't he understand? Why was she having to suffer through this almost completely alone? Who did it?The little hints that Paula Hawkins drops to foreshadow the twisted events at the end are so subtle yet set the mood in a terrifyingly gut-wrenching way that makes you wish you could jump into the book screaming. The imagery was incredible and the descriptions strung together like poetry. I could smell the alcohol on her breath, I could feel the train moving, I could feel her despair. The character development is so deep, that you can't help but love and hate each and every character.It has a ""Gone Girl"" feel with its own unique flair and psychological twist, with an ending you won't see coming."
"I read _Girl on a Train_ since I knew that the film of the same name was based on the Hawkins' novel. The author's style of writing and structure, with main characters offering differing perspectives of the same events, was v similar to the genre of postmodern ""woman in distress"" novels represented best by _Gone Girl_.  As in _Gone Girl_, Hawkins presents us w a femme fatale (or two perhaps) who may or may not have precipitated their own disappearance or dissolution--or salvation. _Girl on a Train_ is a masterful psychological thriller. The novel develops well developed  characters whose outlines come into focus through, among other things, razor sharp dialogue and merciless introspection. What I also found particularly enjoyable about the novel was Hawkins' slow emergence of a short London suburban street and endlessly looping train as a character in its own right, both a geographical and psychological site of cultural and personal imprisonment."
"I downloaded a sample of this book quite awhile ago, but never managed to engage. So many people insisted it was the best book they had read this year, so I finally just hunkered down and dug in. The story is captivating enough, so I imagine that that was a big part of what the fuss is all about. And a female alcoholic protagonist is a new twist on the old unreliable narrator. My problem was that I didn't care for the characters. Not that I disliked them, they just left me cold. Plus, it was pretty easy for me to see where the story was headed, about half way through the book. I read on, hoping for a more interesting plot twist, but when the reveal came, it was unrealistic the way that the perpetrator just came right out and blurted all the details of the murder. So, why 4 stars? Because I'm impressed by all the hoopla have and every time an author attracts the kind of readership that encourages others to pick up a book, I put my own subjective opinion aside, to a degree. Right or wrong, keep reading and reviewing!"
"This site hardly needs another review of ""The Girl on the Train"", but I wanted to say that I felt that the comparisons to ""Gone Girl"", while understandable, were not really as germane as they first appear.  Yes, both books use the unreliable narrator technique, and bad things happen to bad people.  But I felt ""The Girl on the Train"" to be the superior novel.  Not only was the character development better, the book didn't strain the bounds of reader credulity as did ""Gone Girl.""  The sexual crudeness of ""Gone Girl"", the unnecessary profanity that was actually pretty disgusting, was also absent in ""The Girl on the Train.""  I simply felt Paula Hawkins to be the better writer.  I disagree with those that say that Rachel is an unsympathetic character.  People actually do have debilitating problems with alcohol, and blackouts do happen.  I couldn't put the book down, and I didn't hurl it across the room in disgust at the ending as I did ""Gone Girl.""  That's a real recommendation."
A real page turner.  You root for her and then you aren't sure you should. I recommend this on for sure.
"The overall story line was interesting and I liked that it was told from multiple perspectives, however, it was a bit too predictable to me to really be a psychological thriller."
"Don't let the beginning of this story stop you from keeping reading.  It starts out slow, but good heavens, does it get GOOD!  You'll be shocked!"
"It's unusual to meet a cast of characters that all elicit some degree of sympathy but even the ""monster"" does here but they do and their stories keep your attention riveted to their tracks."
It was entertaining but I started sighing half way through and could hardly wait for them to just get on with things. Will not recommend it to anyone.
Edge of your seat suspense  and great plot twists!! Would definite recommend to anyone looking for an easy read that isn't boring
read this over a  year ago...not sure if first person or not.  But a good read.
Interesting but one of those books where you want to choke the main character.
"I was recommended this book by a friend, not the usual genre I read. I should have read it sooner. Amazing book, it will stick with me for some time."
"Very interesting story of the young couple life. Quite complicated , psychologically explore dark side of human spirit. Very believable , almost realistic."
I could not put this book down it was such an amazing novel. I would definitely recommend this to people who love a good mystery.
"I loved how the story was told through 3 characters eyes. It was suspenseful,and at times had you rooting for and against the characters."
It was difficult to get hooked into this book and understand what was going on but stick with it. Once you do you are hooked and can't put it down. What a surprise ending!
"I've recommended this book to everyone. The story is well crafted, the characters interesting and the plot is full of twists and turns. The character development is amazingly subtle, yet powerful. A great read."
If I could give it 0 stars I would. This books is so slow and boring. It was a waste of my time and money. Would not recommend this book to anyone.
Very quick read couldn't put the book down. Just when I thought I figured it out the story added another twist. I recommend it and suggest it would be a great read on a rainy weekend.
This was an excellent book. It keeps you guessing and engaged. It was a great story line and love the way the author takes you from past to presences to fill in the gaps and set the plot. I really enjoy it.
"May have been slow to start but sucked me right in after a few chapter's.  The characters were so well defined, the plot so dark and twisted, I'm sorry I finished it. Now what?"
"Very good novel. Good detail, keeps you guessing. I enjoyed it very much"
ok
"I enjoyed the book, it's a mystery wrapped in a mystery that keeps the reader engaged enough at least to finish the book. There are a lot of implausible actions taken by almost all of the (somewhat unbelievable) main characters that really stretch the reader's ability to willingly suspend disbelief. It's almost distracting. But overall, I'm not mad that I spent the time reading this book. It's not amazing though, I'm a little surprised that it made multiple best-seller lists. And surprised that they made a movie out of it (which is not even as good as the book... don't bother seeing after reading the book, the movie actually does a WORSE job of telling the story). Do I HIGHLY recommend the book? No, I lukewarmly recommend the book. Read it if it's handy. I'd send you my copy but I already mailed it to a friend so they don't have to buy one."
"I really don't get all the hype on this book. The writing is amateur at best. The story and the characters are underdeveloped, all they feel is sad and sorry for themselves. Each woman was more annoying than the next.It started out ok, intriguing and mysterious, but 20% into it I was over it and needed the story to end. I hate slow books.It was too depressing to continue. I was 60% into the story when i decided I didn't want to continue reading it anymore. So I found out about the ending from a reviewer. Only reason I gave this two stars is because the beginning really captivated me and I desperately wanted to enjoy the book."
"I can't imagine comparing this book to Gone Girl! They have nothing in common whatsoever, other than the fact that both are written in a way that you don't like the main characters. But this is part of the interest in Gone Girl - you want to keep reading to see what happens to these awful people. Here, I hated the characters, but I wanted to finish quickly and move on to another book.I found the plot unbelievable. Why would the police not arrest this drunk woman for interfering with their investigation? Perhaps things are different in Britain, but I don't think US cops would allow her to keep wandering (or should I say staggering) into their investigation. The ""evidence"" she has to offer is so very flimsy, the fact that the author tries to force it into this investigation becomes annoying long before the book ends.If you haven't read Gone Girl, read it! If you have read Gone Girl, pick something else from whatever genre you enjoy. It will probably be better than this one!!"
"It took me about 6-8 months before I wanted to read this book.  I asked several people I saw reading the book what they thought and a lot of people said it was just OK.  When I started this book I almost put it right back down.  I did not like the authors writing style.  It was choppy.  After about 2 chapters I was hooked.  Although the style is choppy throughout, this book held my interest totally.  I enjoyed the story, I enjoyed all the characters, and I could feel emotion with each one.  I felt she developed the characters beautifully.  Normally I don't like this jumping back and forth between characters but in this case it was totally necessary to get a total view of what each character was feeling.  I thought the ending was not as great as the rest of the book but it was by no means a deal breaker.  I would highly recommend this book."
"It appears that I am in the minority, giving this novel 3 stars. Readers either love it or hate it. Which is fine, and is the  purpose of having reviews published. When you find reviewers who seem to like the same books you do, you're more inclined to consider other books they liked- that's all. No better, no worse, just different.So, on to the three star rating: This was a light summer read. I personally did not care for the author's style of writing nor how she presented the plot. There was too much focus, I thought, on how much and in what ways, Rachel got drunk, for example.  I got it. She's a raging alcoholic. No need to elaborate on each of the many incidents. And some of the events seemed just too unbelievable. As if someone could sneak into your home, drunk, take your baby while you sleep next to her, then run outside with her and not wind up in jail on attempted kidnapping charges!In addition, I wasn't crazy about the author's style of writing. If you haven't read the novel: each chapter is presented from the point of view of one of the 3 female characters, written in the first person. I began to notice that each started to sound like the others; same way of speaking, even the same expressions, at times. I found it difficult to differentiate among them, since they sounded the same. And since they are all deeply flawed, they needed more character development in order for the reader to find something redeemable about any of them. The reader needs something to hang on to- empathy, sympathy, relate ability- in order to care about a character. I didn't find this to be the case.Perhaps some of my disappointment here lies in the fact that I had just finished All The Light We Cannot See. Beautifully written and developed. Talk about caring for the characters... wow.I am not sorry that I read the book. It is a quick, somewhat entertaining read. Not something you have to dedicate part of your life to. And I can see why it has its share of devoted fans. Even if I am not among them."
"(2.5 stars) Highly overrated, less sophisticated version of Gone Girl:It was an easy read and I was intrigued by the premise of the plot, but this book is highly overrated. Most of the characters are so unlikeable and disingenuous, it's almost laughable. I truly didn't care what happened to any of the characters. The story lacked suspense and I feel like the answer to the mystery was obvious 2/3 of the way through. Overall, it reminded me of a less sophisticated Gone Girl. (I had mixed feelings about Gone Girl, but I appreciated the story's dark psychology and attention to detail)."
"I purchased this book because of the raving reviews. Many said this was the next Gone Girl. However, I found this novel very difficult to read for several reasons. First, there are many perspectives and many time lines happening during the book that I wasn't paying true attention to until about a quarter of the way through. For ex. One perspective takes place Fri in Aug while in a few pages the next perspective takes place Fri in June. The second reason I found this novel difficult to get through is the main character. She is a drunk that I had a hard time empathetizing with. Character development was extremely slow. Half these chapters didn't even need to exist. I felt as if she was just nonstop whining about her life, being drunk, and hating her life. Not a pleasurable read in the least bit.I tried several times putting the book down and starting it back up again in a few days but I just couldn't finish it. I like to read for enjoyment. If I wanted to read about a drunk who couldn't keep a job I would just go on Facebook."
"I did enjoy this book -- it's a quick read and the plot does hold one's attention. It's also refreshing to have a narrator (there are several, but Rachel seems to be the primary one) who is not especially likable; it's a change of pace from the norm.But there were a lot of things about ""The Girl on the Train"" that nagged at me. Yes, it's a thriller, but it went deeper and deeper into implausibility as it proceeded, and I felt like the whole thing could have been wrapped up 50 pages sooner. Rachel's decline, while realistic, also strains credulity a bit -- I will not spoil things, but I felt the supporting characters would not have let her go so far.I would give the book four stars but for one key failing: Every woman in this book is defined entirely by her relationship with men. Being in relationships, being mothers, being loved and ""cared for"" -- that's all that seems to matter to them. (And the men are boorish, smug cads.) One might not seek complexity in a book like this, but I was surprised by the misogyny."
"I generally try to use reviews to choose what I wish to read in part. After reading a few reviews, I kind of knew what I was getting into. I did not expect the tone of the book to be what it was though. It was dark, somewhat twisted- no, I mean a lot twisted. The characters all had personal demons. Wading through the trough of the harsh lives, cheating and treachery of the characters, I tried to see a thread of where Ms. Hawkins was taking the story. Brushing the fumes of alcohol aside and the blackout laden plot, I started to have my own theories build. The theories waxed and waned. I solved the mystery 4 or 5 times before enough detail became evident to reason it out. It was a good effort on Hawkin's part. I don't know if I would put it in the same class as "" Rear Window"" though. It is just another type of story- I think that's why I gave it the 4 stars. The lack of the final star is a common complaint I have of these types of novels. They introduce all at once a part of the plot you could not see at all- nor imagine. It is not a bunch of chess pieces scrambled on a board that slowly rearrange themselves to reveal a final end. Instead these types of stories create critical clues out of the blue that fill in vital pieces of a picture never possible before the clues are revealed. I'd rather have all the pieces laid out there and when the fog lifts, you find yourself saying"" I should have seen it! Great job"". Nevertheless,  it was still a good story, filled with the sick helpless feelings being lost and depressed if things in a ""perfect world"" we're to suddenly go bad. You might want to go outside after finishing this book and look out at a clear sunny day and praise the good fortune of being healthy, happy  and trusting enough to believe all people have good in them. With this book Ms. Hawkin's cuts through this ""good"" as fantasy and paints a different picture of what we are or can be. Somehow, the will to survive and rising above it all- hoping we are still decent at our core may endure. But, you will have to read it to see if that is true."
"I enjoyed this book and was even a tiny bit paranoid for a couple of days after. When I finished I thought I should have been disappointed, but I wasn't. ""Should've been"" because the main characters were not really very likable, bits of imagery from the story seemed implausible, and the writing style - three women telling the story all in the first person can be confusing especially if you put it down midway through one of them. ""Wasn't"" disappointed because an alcoholic trying to piece together information from her blackouts to solve a mystery was intriguing from the start, even if it's been done before, and I was fascinated to be allowed into the mind of this character I didn't much care for in the same way reading about a different place can transport you out of your normal everyday experiences, even when it's not just where you want to be. I imagine Hitchcock would have liked the ending as he used a similar theme in one of his stories ... I won't say which."
"Almost everyone I know has read this book. I wish they had warned me that the first half of the book was five or six characters in search of a plot-line. The girl on the train was an emotional trainwreck, whinging on and on about her past while she drank herself into blackouts. The other characters that were presented were similarly self-absorbed. At about the halfway point there was some development of a storyline and it quickly became obvious who the bad guy had to be. The final quarter of the book quickly laid out the storyline, solved the riddle and revealed the culprit -- no surprise.If you liked ""Gone Girl"" this is similar, but not comparable. The characters are so nebulous and self-absorbed that it was impossible to care what happened to them. The plot wandered a lot which could have been interesting, but somehow it was not. I gave it two stars because it was well-written."
"I agree with others who found the characters all so interchangeable and vile, their dialogue one lie after the other. The author's use of 3 first person monologues ever mixing was so annoying, though I get why she did it. It got so I couldn't tell who was doing the talking half the time, that's what I mean by ""interchangeable."" They were all awful, awful people. I got so frustrated with this that I rushed to finish it so I could be ""rid"" of it for good. Not one redeeming factor in any of these characters, all utterly without morals or apparently, will power... they deserved the misery this book was. I will skip Ms. Hawkins' next work and I don't intend to go see the film just released of this. My curiosity has been fed. But I had to see for myself if this was worthy of all the hoopla being made over it. Not in my world. Another ""Gone Girl""? Not even close."
"Not of the same caliber as Gone Girl.They just made a movie out of it and made comparisons to Gone Girl which I had read.  It is not of the same caliber as Gone Girl.  Gone Girl was more suspenseful and moved along much faster.  This book was confusing and depressing more than dark.  The main character is a drunk.  It was a matter of figuring out who killed Megan.  I will leave that to those of you who want to read this.  There really are not that many convincing twists in this book and the outcome is really not a huge surprise in my view.  The Author tries to obfuscate it but really fails as it is too contrived.  I found the first 2/3 of the book pretty slow going.  Only in the last 1/3 did things really pick up some, but then it was just letting the pieces fall into place and frankly I was not surprised in the least.  Good luck with this one.  I consider it pretty much a waste of time reading this one."
The Girl On The Train is one of the best books I have read in a very long time. I read a lot and love suspense thrillers. I loved how fast paced this book was. I didn't get bored. I can usually guess the ending of movies and books pretty quickly but this one took me for a spin! It was exhilarating! I typically don't like when authors go back and forth between characters. If I can't read it in one setting going back and forth gets confusing. Because of how faced paced and exciting this book is I didn't have that problem. I was able to stay interested from the first page until the last. I was able to keep up with each character and loved how each one developed as you go through it. I felt like I was right there with Rachel through all her flashbacks. Definitely a best seller! Paula Hawkins is an excellent writer! Can't wait to see the movie when it comes out. I will be adding Paula to my list of favorite authors too!
"Since all the characters were unlikeable, didn't care who did it and wish they had all been killed.The IDEA of things observed/story lines created from train window was intriguing, getting this one at least 1 star.But...I hated every minute of reading it."
"What a fantastic page turner, murder mystery, psychological drama with three really troubled women each telling their story.  Rachel, an out of bounds alcoholic with an out of bounds imagination and jealousy; not a very likable person, for sure, but I did keep rooting for her.  Megan, hollow and shallow and haunted by her past and Anna, the young, naive, trusting, suspicious wife and mother......Add three flawed men and you get a marvelously written gripping, entertaining delight. Wish I had been on a long plane flight and not trying to distract myself from the election.  Did not come away with any profound insights about life......just loved, loved the marvelous, entertaining distractions; the details of modern day transportation (trains) in England.  Yes, it is a bit depressing and dark; but it's a murder mystery...Isn't that what reading is all about?"
". . .  restraint writing this book.  For the reader this book is like a present with 336 layers of wrapping paper that are slowly removed to get to the gift within.  I am not saying this is a lovely story.  It is not.  It is ugly and scary, but it is written so beautifully that I enjoyed every word.  I was so enthralled with the writing that it took me awhile to realize that it is narrated by several people.  It was a smack myself in my doofuss head moment, but it didn't bother me at all to start the book again paying attention to who was speaking.Even if you do figure out who the bad person is early it doesn't matter because it's the story and how it unfolds that is important.  This book is full of pathetic, flawed people, but I felt hope at the end.I am not sure  I will see the movie.  I like suspenseful books, but I don't like scary movies even when I know what happens."
"It takes a while for the reader to get passed the fact that none of the narrators in Paula Hawkins, ""The Girl on the Train"" are likeable reliable narrators.  All three of them have problems, their commonality a residential street of houses that backs the train going in and out of London each day.  As all three narrators get their turn to tell their story, the reader pieces together that they are connected in even more intricate ways.  Hawkins does a superb job of keeping the suspense up without revealing much of her hand until the very end of her tale.A young wife goes missing; one of the first person narrators, Rachel, knows the missing girl--she's observed her in passing from the window of her commuter train.  She wants to help the police; she wants to help herself.  She needs a new starting point in life because her husband has left her for another woman . . . and now they have an infant daughter.Hawkins writes of disturbed people whose faces are raw with shame and self-pity.  Her mystery revolves around need.  I listened to the unabridged audio presentation of this book; the performance gets high marks for theatricality and poignancy.  The narrators all have their flaws--there are no super human stereotypes here; together their voices pull together to find a light at the end of a dark tunnel at their own expense.Bottom line?  Some might find the characters too disagreeable to give them time to work their simple magic.  Make the time; this thriller is quietly exciting and chilling in its every day reality. Recommended.Diana Faillace Von Behren""Buzzard's Eye View"""
"The 3 stars are for the 1st 1/3 of the book.  After that, you still hang in there, but the claim that ""you won't see it coming!"" is bunk.  The author is really talented, but she goes down a very predictable path, and to me, both drops a bomb and advertises it's imminent arrival.  I wish she hadn't gone for the birthday party surprise (when you could clearly see your friends' cars parked in your neighborhood) and just taken it to another conclusion less like ""the butler did it gotcha!"" kind of thing."
Was excited to read this book but now that I have I'm not sure what all the hype was about.  I hope they tweaked the movie to make it better.  The jumping back and forth between time and characters was somewhat confusing at times because the first person narrative of the three different characters all sounded the same so sometimes one wondered who exactly was talking because they all sounded very similar.  I'm disappointed I spent the money for the Kindle version.  I don''t even know I would have been okay with spending $3-4 at the used bookstore either.
"In a word: crap.I took this book with me on a beach vacation because I wanted something to breeze through, something to entertain me. I do not ask for much in my beach reads: plot, some coherent writing, character development. I gave this book more than a fair shot. But I'm stopping at page 175.Poor writing, flat characters, and the author's sexist tone seeps off every page. Every female psychosis is on display here: dressing the part, feeling worthless, feeling like a child, sexual motivation behind how men act, women's revenge, ""I'm a force to be reckoned with,"" ""all these men,"" the list goes on....I can't take it anymore. Life is too short to read bad books like this one.I hate it1/5 Goodreads1/5 Amazon"
"The three principal characters in THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN have much in common. They're not very likable, they're depressing, and they don't have much taste in men.Rachel is the girl on the train. She's lost her job for drinking on the job. Her husband has left her for another woman, and to top matters off, he's had a baby with his new wife, with whom he was carrying on an affair while still married to Rachel. That's what broke up Rachel's marriage; she couldn't have a baby. She takes the train to work every day to fool her land lady roommate (the nicest woman in the book) into thinking she still has a job. The part about the train has to do with two people she sees almost every day on their veranda. She doesn't know them, but she convinces herself they're the happy couple. She even gives them names. They live a few doors down from where she used to live with her husband Tom.The second woman is Megan. Megan lives with a horrible secret I won't reveal here. Let's say, psychologically, it has affected her. She's the woman in the ideal couple, but she's far from ideal. She sleeps around; she even makes a move on her therapist. It's not clear whether he sleeps with her, but Rachel does see them kissing from the train.  Megan also winds up dead. That's the best part of the book as far as suspense is concerned. I read a lot of mysteries, and usually I can tell who did it within the first fifty pages, but there are several candidates here, and I didn't know who killed Megan until the author told me.The third woman might be the creepiest of all. She had an affair with Tom and she knew he was married. She even reveled in it. The woman is close to a sociopath. She only cares about her own little world, her husband and her baby. When she is confronted with a physical threat she runs away. Some might argue that she's only protecting her baby, but it seems to be more than that. She also does something creepy during the denouement to someone who can't defend himself/herself.I really don't see how this book has stayed on the best seller list for most of the year. As I said above, about the only redeeming quality is the “who done it” aspect. It's also hard to believe that Megan, who worked at an art gallery before it closed, would babysit for people she barely knew, that is unless you consider that the author needed her to. Her horrible secret also involves a baby. This is called author intrusion, and it's a bad “no no” for literary critics."
"The Girl on The Train by Paula Hawkins… OMG! This has to be one of my absolute favorite reads in 2015! Murder, obsession, evil, jealousy, cruelty and heartbreaking at times, The Girl on The Train has what it takes to keep you turning those pages and let me tell you… the twist at the end will have your jaw drop! It is so deceptively simple in some ways, that as you are reading, suddenly the sun is setting, day turns into night and your eyes have not left the page. I wasn't furiously turning the pages, I was absentmindedly turning the pages because I was so engrossed in the story.Here's the gist… Rachel Watson rides the train everyday past a housing complex and becomes obsessed with this couple she sees most days lounging on their patio… until Rachel sees something that she shouldn't see. But because Rachel has some problems of her own, when she tries to tell someone what she saw, no one believes her… until… Read this book! Both a great murder mystery and literary fiction. Well written characters, a leading lady that you can empathize with, and a great story. If Hitchcock were to write murder mysteries, this would be it!I give this 5+ Train Tickets! Hop aboard and enjoy"
"A friend suggested this book to me,knowing that Emily Blunt would be playing Rachel in the movie. I started it a couple times, but couldn't get into it. The switching back and forth between characters was really confusing to me and I couldn't tell what was what. Then after my husband read it, he explained that once you get to a certain point it makes more sense and at least the characters are made clear. It did become more suspenseful and then I just needed to know who did it. My thoughts wavered a few times between the characters, but in the end it was not my first pick. It all made sense then and I'm glad it turned out the way it did. I'm glad Rachel and Anna helped each other in the end. Still a pretty creepy story though. Reminds me of all the sick stories you hear about in the news. Unfortunately, there really are people out there doing these terrible things. Scary!"
"The Girl on the Train occupies a similar space as Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl. In both, we move through the minds of multiple narrators who may or may not be lying, to us and/or to themselves. This ends up being very effective and is what pulls you forward into the story, despite the fact that the inciting incident doesn't rear its head for thirty or forty pages.While there are three characters we focus on throughout the book, the first is arguably the main character: Rachel. She has been divorced for two years and is a serious alcoholic. She blames her drinking for her current state and for the end of her marriage. She's living with a friend, paying rent, and lost her job several months ago. Too ashamed to admit it to anyone, she continues to take the train into the city every day.The train stops regularly in the same place, behind some houses in a nice little town. From her vantage point on the train, Rachel watches a married couple go about their morning. She calls them Jess and Jason, though she doesn't have any idea what their real names are. She's constructed a perfect little life for them in her head.But it falls apart the morning Rachel sees Jess kissing another man on her back porch. And shortly after that, Jess goes missing entirely.I won't say more for fear of spoiling what is genuinely a good story. Just know that we get multiple perspectives on the events, and everyone is much more connected than may first be apparent. Highly recommended if you're into Gone Girl and that sort of dark, psychological thriller. A well-constructed mystery with compelling characters."
"In a nutshell: it was ok.Let me start by briefly explaining why I chose this book. Everyone seemed to be raving about it. Even NYPL! So, as usual.. I thought: I need thisin my life! I had (unfortunately) high expectations about this book and I didn't even bother to read what was it about. I read that it was similarto Gone Girl, I even quote: ""“The Girl on the Train has more fun with unreliable narration than any chiller since Gone Girl. . . . [It] is liable to draw a large, bedazzled readership.”—The New York Times"".In my opinion, it is just an ok book. I still have my doubts if it is a cleverly plotted thriller. Paula Hawkings indeed tried to present compelling characters,but to me, they were a bit too predictable and in some cases, annoying. Now, it alternates between three points of view (all females), and to me, tends to fall to unnecessary (not always, but in this case) and gimmicky. Basically the whole mystery is a mess right up until the last chapters, where you get a grip of the situation. The ending for me was extremely melodramatic, and I thought for a minute I just read a Hollywood movie. Very few real twists, first chapters are monotonous. Plain and simple: just mediocre.While on Gone Girl we saw how the author fought back against female cliches of the accommodating victim or love interest with a cold, calculating villain, The Girl on the Train takes a less defiant angle. The main character: Rachel is delivered through an unwittingly unreliable narration to evoke the aftershocks of abuse and trauma. Do I think this was a powerful way of exploring women's marginalization? Not entirely. I am not 100% convinced. I did not like any of the characters, and to be quite honest, the male roles were a bit stereotyped (that is just my impression). I do not get what is the hype about this book? It isn't a bad one, but surely not a master piece either! It is a bit depressing even?Conclusion:*It is an ok book, touching the limits with mediocre? Take this book for your summer holidays at the most. Do not expect a deep, fascinating suspense book.*Boring, a little bit depressing? At the end picks up the pace and you feel more hooked.*Complex but a bit predictable characters.*Easy to read!"
"This book, read from the perspectives of three different women on divergent and convergent timelines, leaves quite a bit to be desired. Paula's writing is difficult to follow, the characters are mostly unlikable and make very questionable decisions. Common sense is apparently lacking in this particular part of England.What started off as a novel premise eventually meanders its way into half-truths, mis(sing)-information, and lots of ""surprises"" that are less surprises and more like the guy who tells a joke but has to keep going back and adding in more detail because he forgot. This frustrating novel is really just a  long joke, with lots of ""oh yeahs"" and ""I forgot"" (literally).If all of the characters involved got hit by the titular train I think this book would be more compelling. Alas, that's not the case and we're left with the sour aftertaste of characters ripped from a Maury Povich show."
"I’m no expert when it comes to this genre or analyzing a writer’s intent. I took the book as a personal look at myself. One who live a good portions of my life in the same state as Rachel , but with a different storyline..it was all darkness. Never looking back at the ones criticizing , I fail into their opinion of me. It took and still does take years to look back and dissect them. Rachel at the end started to see the people around as they were.. as I have. The book as read it , was all in darkness, as my former life was. As I formed a kinship with Rachel , I found empathy for her – you ( I )may have an understanding of what was , but the darkness remains. Other reviews –reviewers can, I’m sure give , a more distant view of this book, but I can’t. A couple weeks have past since I read the book, but when I pick up my reader I still feel its impact of it on me. But the book was like an AA meeting, as you hear others , you get a better understanding of yourself and the past. Please read other reviews by others, who can see this book outside of the forest , I have not gotten far enough out to see it."
A few people highly recommended this book so I gave it a try. Found the beginning to be very slow and almost stopped reading it. The story eventually got interesting but I never really cared for the main character. Maybe the story will be turned into an interesting movie but I cannot recommend reading the book.
"Disappointing after all the hype. The plot was twisted and unpredictable, which was good, but I stopped caring about what happened because the characters were so uninteresting. The story was told from the point of view of three female characters: Rachel, the primary character, was whiny and weak, still pining for a broken marriage with a nasty two-timer; Anna, the woman he cheated with, didn't come to life at all; and Megan, a neighbor of Anna's, seemed to be calmly narrating her fate even while expiring. In any case, I failed to connect with any of them. And the male characters, without giving the ending away, were disturbing and violent. It takes more than these one-dimensional people to make a mystery novel interesting. This one failed to deliver."
Loved the book copy and I would love to see the movie to this wonderful book that keyed me on the edge of my seat.
I'm about halfway through the book and I CAN'T PUT IT DOWN!! I just know something disastrous or crazy is about to happen.
I enjoyed this book. The short prose of each character kept it flowing smoothly and kept me intrigued. Good read.
Five stars.  I never knew what was going to happen and it was always a surprise.  A very good book.
"I found the writing elegant but the back and forth between the stories of Rachel, Anna and Megan was unnecessarily complex and often repetitive."
The book could have been better paced. But it is undeniably a very good thriller. I think it could have been shorter and the suspense would have still been the same.
"Told from the point of view of three women, the mystery surrounding the disappearance of one of the women is revealed.  The first person narrative allows the author to obscure the details based on personal perspective and keeps the reader on their toes until the very end."
Really great book. You really don't know who did the crime until the characters do. A must read for anyone who loves figuring out puzzles.
"Considering the characters' POV and personal issues, I consider this a tragic story rather than a suspenseful mystery."
Just finished re reading this great book before I see the movie.  Hope that they stay true to most of the book!
Made me want to see the movie.
Very exciting read.  I have to admit that I got a little disgusted at times with the lead character.  Had some elements of GONE GIRL in it I thought.  Keeps you in suspense and worth reading.
"i wasn't sure about this book in the beginning, but it got better as it went along. It was worth keeping up."
excellent story. Figured out the end about 80% through but still a very exciting ending. Really worth the read. Once you're into it a real page turner. Great read for both men and women.
"I couldn't put this book down. Great thriller! You fall in love with characters that you'd typically hate, this Author actually makes you fall in love with these very flawed characters."
"GOod first novel, but left dissappointed and the read itself was overly contrived. Will be curious as to how they handle it in the movie..."
This is an interesting mystery that will keep you in suspense.  Good story Have not seen the movie.
This book kept me guessing the entire time. I definitely needed s one wine at the end. Great book and can't wait to read more of her books.
"I watched the movie first , I thought the book would be awful because I fell so in love with the movie but j was wrong I was just as wrapped into the book!"
Started with great interest....was a little redundant and ending was not as much of a  mystery as I thought it was going to be
"I enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down once I started reading it.  Paula Hawkins has a very unique style.  If you like a good mystery, I would recommend reading this book."
Now know why this has been on the Best Sellers so long. Great page-turner of a story. Lot's of twists to the plot. Loved it!
"Movie worthy Story, with solid gripping suspense."
Gripping and Intriguing. Very well written! There will def be a movie is there isn't one in the works already!
Book kept me in suspense. Great read highly recommend can't put they book downCan't wait to read second book
If I could I would give this 6 stars. Read it in one day simply because I couldn't put it down!
"The use of , His, Hers and He and She, instead of using a persons name was often confusing.I didn't particularly care for the format or the index."
What a great read this turned out to be! I'm a HUGE fan of Gone Girl and this rivals it on my top 10 list. Very interesting and fast paced.
"It was a good read, but I didn't really connect with the characters, which seemed sort of flat for me."
"Loved this book! A NY times best seller, it was entertaining and a good read."
"I didn't want the motion picture to spoil the book, so I made sure to bump this reading up on my list. Overall it was good - the plot had just enough twists to hold my interest, and I appreciated the set-up of the chapters being narrated by different characters during overlapping periods of time. It allows you to see the same scene from the eyes of different characters. That being said, I did figure out the ending without meaning to. Maybe it's all those crime shows I watch. I guess I just can't be thrilled by the thrillers the way I used to be. I also found that a couple of the character's voices were too similar for their differing personalities, but that's just me being picky. I would recommend the book if you're looking for a plot with scandal and emotional turmoil with an underlying premise of the existential crisis that can result from love gone wrong."
"I feel this book started slowly......a boring account of random details that jump back and forth. However, a little more than half way through I see the meaning of all those details as they start to merge together and tie my mind into a suspenseful clutch that kept me interested and unable to put the book down.Even after the ""big reveal"" towards the end there's still a lot of questions and suspense and the story draws to a conclusion. I do feel it ended rather weak.....missing that OMG feeling as I turned the last page. And still I have two remaining questions???(Possible SPOILER BELOW)1) What ever happened to Scott? Did he find out what really happened?2) Did Rachel and/or Anna tell the police about Tom & Megan??Did I miss something?"
"I think that what the book lacked in the beginning and middle, it made up for in the ending. I, of course, won't spoil it here, but it is very slow up until the ending which was somewhat predictable. The characters, main included, are somewhat dry, and altogether predictable. I can't help but imagine that the book would have been a much better read if told from Anna's perspective, as she was one of the only complex characters. Affairs are the key point of the book, though none take turns away from the predictable. The book spoils itself around the middle--towards the end, providing 1-2 red herrings before finally settling into the finale; naturally tidying the story and hitting all of the tropes of a murder mystery unabashedly. For myself, I read the book expecting the caliber of story that a Gillian Flynn novel may provide, a good airport page-turner to get me through a flight. Though this was a book that bored me in the beginning, middle, hooked me 30 pages before the ending, and finally disappointed me. I usually refrain from giving negative reviews, but honestly I wish someone would have let me know that there was better junk-lit out there. Try Gillian Flynn, Stephen King, or anything really. If you are tremendously bored, give this one a go. I couldn't pay attention to this book and ended up playing with my napkin if that gives you any notion of how this book is read."
"Girl named Anna – she’s a bit messed up. Girl named Megan – she’s a bit messed up. Girl named Rachel – she’s a bit messed up. Rachel likes to ride trains. One day she sees SOMETHING, and nothing is ever the same.To be honest, this book was a bit of a letdown. All the hype. All the intrigue. It just fell a little bit flat, and left me feeling deflated at the end. I thought there would be MORE.This story is told in alternating perspectives from three different women: Rachel, Anna, and Megan, each with their own set of unique baggage. I disliked them all so much, I can’t decide who I like the least – but this was an I-enjoy-not-liking-you dislike, if that makes sense. However, none of them really roused much empathy from me, and I only developed surface level feelings. Frankly, I just didn’t really care all that much about any them.Don’t get me wrong, it was good enough, and certainly held my interest. I read it pretty quickly, and definitely was invested in the story. The alternating perspectives, and the way it jumped around in time, though commonplace in books these days, was, for the most part, successful here. The writing was simple, and clipped along at a decent pace to grab and maintain my attention.All in all, I would say read it, but it’s a case of been-there-done-that for me. It obviously works for some people though, given it’s reigning status at the top of the bestsellers list. I also think it would make a great book club pick, as it’s short, quick, and full of plenty of chat-able fodder.For more, visit www.bookishtendencies.com"
"I had a hard time getting into this at first, but I put it aside and went back a few weeks later. I just wasn't ready at first for the first-person accounts of all of the characters, written in present tense, it was confusing. But I decided to give this author a chance, so I went back to the first few chapters to see how she'd crafted the characters and dated the scenes. If finally fell into place, and I went right through it in a couple of days. I like the way she placed the blame, or allowed the reader to place blame, on other people, and finally when the true culprit came to light, I could breathe a sigh of relief, and was glad that people aren't always as they seem, and for the most part these characters had reasons for being the way they were. It's a well-written psychological drama/thriller."
"Rachel Watson is a down-on-her-luck young woman who rides the train in and out of London every day to hide the fact that she has lost her job from her roommate, and to maintain a tenuous link to what she once was: gainfully employed, happily married and sober. One particular house near the railway tracks fosters an increasingly unhealthy obesssion in Rachel on these daily trips, with its seemingly perfect couple who sit on the terrace. Is it a secret longing for what Rachel once had? Or something more forbidding, something on her own emotional doorstep?With its Hitchcock like setup and close similarity to Gillian Flynn’s work, ‘Girl on a Train’ opens with this compelling story question. Then Rachel’s blurred recollection of a crime she witnesses in a drunken stupor causes her to stumble through the lives of others, wreaking havoc on ex-neighbors, her ex-husband, and aggravating the police, who soon lose patience with Rachel’s drinking and lies. You may actually find yourself doing the same as she keeps hitting the bottle.But ultimately ‘Girl on a Train’ disappoints. It just can’t live up to its promising start.If ever there was an unreliable narrator, it’s Rachel.And this is part of the book’s problem: The reader is too often misled into feeling one way about a character, only to have it not be so. The mystery itself relies too heavily upon Rachel’s opportune blackouts, taking us to the edge of discovery only to learn that she just can’t quite remember what happened. Until she does. And then the murderer does something so dumb (keeping a key piece of evidence any killer worth their salt would surely have gotten rid of) that it violates the ‘maximum capacity’ rule of a worthy villain. He/she also manages to give the clichéd, expository summing up toward the end of the book, explaining in detail the crimes committed and the motives for committing them.Like Gillian Flynn’s books, the parallel to ‘Girl on a Train’ is apparent: multiple narrators switching back and forth in first person as the crime unravels, everyday people living lives of quiet desperation, marriages that appear to be perfect but aren’t. But whereas Flynn’s writing can soar, and her characters are rich and nuanced, Paula Hawkins’ prose is deliberate and too ordinary to make us want to spend so much time in her character’s heads. There are clarity issues in the story telling as well, not helped by the fact that all three narrators are young English women of the same age, same class, with similar backgrounds and voices.Girl on a train is a solid suspense read however, although mystery buffs will find themselves want more."
"I gave this book four stars because I really enjoyed reading it, and sometimes couldn't put it down. I would have given it five stars but for some reason I had a VERY hard time with the fact that Rachel rode the train everyday to pretend that she didn't lose her job. That she would get ready, ride the train in the morning, find something to do for eight hours, and then ride it home, just because she didn't want her landlord to find out she'd lost her job. Doing all of this while dealing with alcoholism and depression just doesn't sound believable to me. As long as she paid her rent on time, why would it matter if she lost her job?  Each chapter would be from a different person's point of view which would sometimes get annoying and confusing, but in the end made for a very mysterious and enjoying read."
"Don't stop reading this book!  Once you get thought the first little bit (and it is not boring... just building slowly and with purpose), you won't be able to stop.  Like the trains that permeate the story, moving it along and giving it reason, the book begins slowly, like a chugging locomotive trying to pull its passengers, overcoming inertia, and then builds as the story weaves itself in and out of the lives of each character, ultimately racing along like a runaway train rushing headlong with its full inertia, dragging all the passengers (and you) to the final conclusion while making you unable and unwanting to put it down.  Once you figure out the mystery you will watch the characters as they put together the pieces and make decisions leading to their ultimate destinies... and you will be unable to turn away, watching, wishing.As you read, you meet each character through both her own eyes as well as through the eyes of others... very intriguing.  And I love the use of paralleling the characters and their lives... wonderful!  When you begin reading, you must pay attention to the dates... they are important.As a warning to those who become engrossed and completely absorbed into books and their characters I must say that during my first couple of chapters I did feel nauseous, but only because one of the main characters was ""feeling ill"" (and it was not due to content).  Again, this is only because I allow myself to really enter the lives of the characters.  But I am so happy that I did not let that deter me from continuing.  Read this book!"
"I bought this book, ""The Girl on the Train"" because I had heard that it was a great book, with lots of plot twists and turns.  I had heard that it was a similar type book to ""Gone Girl.""  It does have lots of plot twists.  It is similar in type to ""Gone Girl.""  It simply is not my kind of book.  I like mysteries -- and this book was definitely mysterious from beginning to end, but it was definitely too dark for me.  (So was ""Gone Girl, so I should have known better)  I don't want to give away the plot, but I will say this -- If you want a feel good book, this is definitely not the one for you.  I like to finish a book and feel better by the end.  I didn't see that happen here.  It was well written -- each chapter takes on the persona of one of the main characters, so you really do get to feel what they are feeling and doing.  It does bounce back and forth through time, but the chapter headings will let you know that."
"Paula Hawkins hit the ball out of the park with ""Girl on the Train.""  It is very interesting and a page turner from the very first page.  Ms Hawkins slowly expands the story from a sole character riding the same scheduled trains to and from work every day, or so the reader is led to believe.  Nothing is as it seems.  There are two more women added as primary characters and here's the thing I've never experienced before, Ms Hawkins continues the story as each of these three women, seamlessly, speaking as each of them in the first person singular.  Just pay attention to dates and times of trains.  That's all I'm going to say.There are many, many reviews that you can read here that will tell you the whole plot.  I would never begin reading a book knowing the plot and I won't do that to you here.  What I will do is comment to people who have come to trust my taste as to whether they will enjoy this book.  Is it worth the money?  Is it worth your time?  To both I will say very big YES's !!!Paula Hawkins can write and reading her is such a pleasure after reading some of the junk that has been put out to us from really major writers.  You will enjoy the way she treats the English language and you will enjoy this very unusual story as it is narrated by three different women from their own points of view.Buy it.  Have a good read."
"I have to be honest even with all the amazing reviews I still think I barely liked it.  I bought it because of the zillion good reviews and I am sure that is why most are buying it.SPOILER:I am ok at predicting plot twists but I feel like this one was very very obvious. I mean from the second they tell you Megan babysat and he smiled at her and then a few pages later ""he"" smiled at her driving by it was very obvious that it was Tom...I mean you can't help but compare it to Gone Girl and although I did not like the ending of Gone Girl , Gone Girl blows this book out of the water. Flynn's book is so smart and clever this is kind of boring and mostly about an alcoholic who you don't feel for and I could not even get myself to like a single character or be interested in any of them.I did not care for it at all to each his/her own."
"Really, more of a 2.5 star review. The initial premise of a troubled woman who becomes engrossed in the ""passing lives"" of a couple whose home she sees daily from her train commute is a good one. Unfortunately, it was the highpoint of the book for me. I'd guessed the plot by about page 60, and really kept reading to see if I was correct. (I was) I truly kept hoping I would be surprised. The story is told from the point of view of three women: Rachel, Megan and Anna, with Rachel being the main character. She's a drunk. Eventually, she becomes an such erratic unlikable, needy repetitive drunk, I was just kind of hoping she'd jump from the train. The plot is facilitated by convenient blackouts, which I could buy into, but it's the clipped points of view of the other two characters that I found to be weak writing. The chapters from Megan and Anna's POV are limited because they're clearly holding back information they know--particularly Megan. A red flag example is a short Megan chapter dedicated to inner thoughts about her lover, whom she refers to as ""he."" The lack of a proper noun tells me the ""he"" she's having an affair with in this chapter is a different ""he"" than was mentioned by name in an earlier chapter. With only so many characters in the book, ""he"" became quite obvious. If you don't think too hard while reading, I can see where The Girl on the Train is an interesting book. I don't think the plot is anything close to masterful."
"The Girl on the Train is the perfect thriller to read on a trip--it's quick and easy to read, it's intriguing, and it keeps you guessing.I have to say, Hawkins has done a great job at creating a slew of characters to dislike. I don't mean that as a bad thing, though. I thoroughly enjoyed reading a book where I felt like I was my own detective, trying to solve a mystery where I couldn't even trust the narrators. There was some type of a plot twist around every corner, and in the end, I was very much satisfied by the climax and conclusion Hawkins created. (I'll add a quick caveat here that there was one part of the story towards the end about one of the character's backgrounds that is so quickly explained, that it felt like an afterthought thrown in for necessity, but not development--that was disappointing).The only major complaint I had about this book was that so much of it felt unoriginal and cliche to me. The characters were somewhat dull: Rachel is an alcoholic, Megan is a restless obsessive, and Anna is a narcissist. But very little of each of these character's traits were developed further. And the men in this book were so black-and-white that I sort of pity any man who reads this book because the stereotypes are so plain to see--the men are either doting, kind-hearted lovers or oppressive, jealous villains.But then again, maybe these cliches were exactly Hawkins point--to make the setting and characters so ordinary that it made the story just that more chilling."
"It took quite an effort to get through it It really draggeedandwas depressing at least half way through it. After reading, I will skip the movie."
"This is a tough book to review, because I cannot honestly say that I disliked it. I liked it. Begrudgingly, I liked it. It was a quick and easy read. I switched back and forth between the Kindle and Audible versions and though I liked the acting in the audiobook, I found myself just wanting to read because I could do so quicker than listening.This book reminded me a lot of Gone Girl--seemingly complex characters that somehow seem completely base when you get to know them. There is no one to like or root for, which is frustrating, and you are not sure who to trust because there are multiple narrators. Everything leads up to a reveal, which I believe most readers will be able to figure out about halfway through the book, and then the story just ends.Unlike Gone Girl, I believe it was mildly well-written, capturing voice especially well. I also did not feel as if my time was wasted because it was such a fast read, and I did find myself thinking about the stories when I wasn't reading. I gave it three stars because emotionally, I let myself get involved, and any less stars would have been dishonest (but oh how I longed to give it only two!).This is a good beach or vacation read, something to excite you during the mundane winter months or pass the time on a long trip. It is not a life-changing journey, nor is it something that will leave you feeling as if you learned something, but it will certainly keep you guessing."
"I'm usually not a fan of mysteries like this because the ending seems to be obvious early on in most authors' writing. But it came highly recommended and I got it for a long airplane flight which proved to be a great idea!  It took the first person view of several of the women involved and really twisted the possibilities around. This was entertaining, suspenseful, not cookie-cutter at all, and actually had me guessing almost to the very end. I'll definitely recommend it to others and look for more books by this author."
"This book made feel goosebumps. Certain parts were written very well that it had me looking behind my shoulder. Good mystery had me guessing pretty much the whole way convincing me along the way that it could of been others. Only negative to me was that some parts felt like fillers pointless and dragging on very few though. I recommend this to any mystery reader, people struggling with alcohol (me), and I personally think those books are awfully written but any fan of fifty shades of grey would enjoy this. Watching the film later."
"I typically don't read bestsellers, because I want to give my time to relatively unknown authors who are struggling to get their books into the hands of readers. However, my book club recommended The Girl on the Train and I didn't want to comply so I read it. OMG! I haven't put it down in the last three days and it took me three days only because of work obligations. There are so many reasons why I loved this book. First, technically it is superb! Second, the transition of Rachel is exactly how it should of been stronger, but still flawed. Anna, the one person she hates and desperately doesn't want to have something in common with now shares a forever bond. The book was exceptional! Congratulations to Paula Hawkins!"
"I know that I'm one out of thousands who wrote a review for this book but I just couldn't help myself in relating my viewpoint.  I bought the book from amazon because every article raved about the book, calling it the new ""Gone Girl"", which I also read.  The story revolves around three women; the girl on the train, Rachel, who really should be the ""woman"" on the train because she is no longer a girl, being in her thirties.  Meagan and Anna are the other two women in the story.  Rachel, who is out of work and an alcoholic, gets on the train every day to go to a job that she no longer has and returns at the end of the day to where she shares a flat with another woman.  She is also an ex-wife of a man who has remained in their home, with his new wife, the one who caused the divorce, and their baby.  The new wife is Anna and Meagan is their neighbor.  These people all live in homes bordering the train tracks and so Rachel, on her travels to her non-job, passes by and watches them in their daily lives, still pining away for her ex-husband and builds an imaginary life for Meagan who lives with her husband a few doors down.  As each woman speaks in the novel, you get an insight into what really is going on in her life.  The problem with the story is that Rachel, Anna, and Meagan all appear to have the same personality which confused me and I found myself going back several pages to see which woman was talking.  Since they each had different problems and lives it would make sense that they had varied personalities and would not sound like Rachel.  And even though Rachel didn't want her flat-mate to find out that she lost her job, I couldn't relate to the fact that she was spending every day traveling into London and back again, just to spy on her ex-husband, etc.  Many times I wanted to put the book down and forget it but once I pay for something, I force myself to read on, hoping it will improve, thus the ending, which I found a little more to my liking.  I can't say that this is the ""new"" ""Gone Girl"", because the story is different and I couldn't really get hold of the characters as well as I should.  It's the kind of novel that you take to the beach if you're near one, or read in the backyard for an afternoon.  For a first published novel, I think the author tried to put the story into perspective as she saw it, but I felt I had to push myself to finish the book.  Happily I did so that I could enjoy the ending."
"I was so excited for this book, and I am so genuinely disappointed. There was nothing original or ""thriller"" about it plot-wise, the main character is highly unlikeable (there are no redeeming or even EXCITING or INTERESTING qualities about ANY of the characters, but the main one is just an unlikeable, bland, boring person), and the whole book is really very boring until the last 15 or so pages, and the action that fills those pages is VERY predictable. There's no plot twist, there's no hero or heroine, there's little to no character arc/development. The only reason I finished it was because I kept hoping for that spark or twist or something that people kept raving about. I would give it 1 star, but I feel that it does have potential to be a good movie if done correctly; I'll be seeing it."
Got this book to read before seeing the movie. Loved it!
"Two abusive men, three unstable women.. what's to like about it..  much hype some really unlikeable people.."
Lots of people like this book. I found the characters unlikable.  The story became tedious.
Both the book and the movie held my interest which is saying something with modern literature.
Read the book before seeing the movie.  The book was a page turner.
Keeps you guessing. A little bit slow in some parts though.  Would recommend to a friend. Great Book overall though.
One of the best books I've read in 2016. I could not stop reading.
Alcohol says it best!!
"This was a great read, finished in a couple days as it really kept my attention. It felt a bit obvious but it was still enjoyable."
I recommend everyone read this book.The twist at the end was difficult to see coming.  This is an exceptional novel.
"The Girl on the Train asks questions that our society shies away from. How important is it for a woman to be a mother? If someone cheats, who is to blame? Should an alcoholic be trusted and how much is too much?Rachel tries unsuccessfully to put her life together after her marriage crumbles. She rides the train to and from London everyday, caught up in her thoughts and swimming in the aftereffects of a night of drinking. The train always stops at a row of houses, where Rachel sees Jason and Jess living out their romantic lives. Rachel witnesses an argument between Jason and Jess and the next morning Jess is reported missing. Rachel is thrown into the mystery surrounding Jess’ disappearance while clashing with the lives of her ex-husband Tom and his wife Anna.A cast of suspicious characters make an appearance as Rachel works to discover the murderer. Though the killer’s identity is well hidden, the story reads less as a “who done it” and more like a sympathetic narrative of a suffering woman tossed around by circumstances. I identified with the struggle of the three different narrators, their ugliness ringing as true as their virtues. This is a great summer read and will keep you up as you rush to discover the ending. It is definitely worth missing sleep at night!"
"If you haven't read much up on this book yet, I highly suggest not reading about any of the characters or even a plot summary before reading the book. I think it might take away from some of the elements of the writing that I personally might not have enjoyed otherwise if I had done so. (That said, I mention the main character in the next sentence but it's vague enough to not give anything away.) The main quality I found endearing about this book is the main character, Rachel. She's a hot mess in a dark place and I've definitely had times in my life that felt somewhat similar to that, so it was interesting to see how she handled some very less than comfortable situations. One of the main twists I actually kind of expected so I think that made the book seem a little bit less suspenseful to me, which made this would have been 4 star a 3 star for me."
"It was just okay! Maybe because the book was hyped up so much, I expected a lot more. Instead I found it to be a bit shallow in terms of the plot and character development. It wasn't clear why the police kept on jumping from one suspect to another without really having reasonable leads or evidence... and why certain characters were introduced and portrayed the way they were (other than to mislead the reader). It was a quick read though... and worth reading if one is planning to watch the movie."
"Will keep this short and sweet - good book, chapters are broken up by character which I found very interesting and unlike most of the books I read. A good portion of the book dives deep into each of the main characters, namely Rachel. In general the book kept my attention and was easy to follow. I do remember the moment I couldn't put the book down - around 80-81% (read on my Kindle). <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008A> I don't usually have reactions to books like that and/or find time to read consistently (have 2 kiddos under 3).Have not seen the movie, probably wait until it's avail at home. Have heard from many that it strays from the book (not a big surprise), but what seems so silly is that the book is based in London and suburbs, why is the movie in NY? I love NYC, but come'on!"
"I became interested in this book after seeing a preview of a teaser of the movie featuring Emily Blunt which is coming out this year. After doing some research, the summary sounded intriguing and I decided ""Why Not!?"". So glad I did.I couldn't put this book down and read it within two days of its delivery! Even covering my reading light with the comforter so I didn't disturb my parter. He appreciated that, haha.The story is told from different viewpoints, keeping you guessing as to who did what until the end. I've heard it's similar to Gone Girl, which yes, I have yet to read or see the movie...gasp, I know! But, if you like the mystery, who did it book type of storyline, then I recommend checking out this book. Now, just waiting to see how Emily pulls off the lead character."
"A rare treasure, written with verve and suspense, impossible to put down, and yet it needs perspective, standing back from it, contemplating the nuances, the self-absorption, the narcisistic nature of alcoholism.  Narcisists don't have to be beautiful, they don't necessarily revel in their self-esteem.  Quite the contrary, underneath it all they fear they are not beautiful and their self-esteem is absent or damaged, but they are absorbed in their own reflection, content, in fact surreptitiously delighted to subject those around them to their compulsions.  Yet Hawkins has turned it all into a mystery thriller.  Her recourse for the character's catharsis is chilling.  Are all women masochists?  And do they love the sociopath in compelling men?  This book is exceptional, far more than just a ""good read"", despite the occasional and very minor slips in syntax."
"I enjoyed the first three quarters of this book. It was exciting and fast-paced, and I enjoyed being pulled into the main protagonist’s mess of a mind. While she was a wreck and an alcoholic, I still found her sympathetic enough to be likable. One of the themes of the book was that no person or family is perfect, and I think the author did a good job of conveying this. I also enjoyed the buildup as we discover what’s going on with the other woman, Megan, in this story.My disappointment came toward the end. Maybe I’ve read too much fiction, but I didn’t find the twist all that exciting or interesting. Because of this, I did enjoy “Gone Girl” and the awesome use of the unreliable narrator a lot more. Given all the positive reviews, it seemed like “Girl on the Train” was going to lead up to something really unique. Given the deteriorating mental state of the protagonist, I was preparing myself for something along the lines of multiple personality disorder or finding out a character wasn’t real. (Not that those devices are completely unique—but I was still waiting for something kind of off the wall) Instead, it just becomes a terrifying domestic dispute. The men in this story are also very unlikable and needed a few more redeeming qualities.I’d recommend it for a fun summer poolside read but don’t expect too much."
"The story starts of from the viewpoint of a woman so depressed and in such psychic pain that she regularly drinks herself into oblivion. She lost her husband, her job , rents a small bedroom from a friend, and  pretends  to take the train to work each day and sees  the back of houses on her old street as she goes into London.  She daydreams about a  couple a few doors down from where she used to live  and she occasionally  sees one or both of them and others as the train passes.  She imagines their life together as perfect and as what she had so longed for.  She is so devastated about being left for another woman who had her ex-husband's baby and she feels so sad that she lost him and agrees with him that she was to blame.  The sad part is, she had  been systematically taken apart, her pride, her will , her sense of self , by  a sociopath who enjoys seducing, controlling, and then draining women of any sense of worth and when he succeeds, abandons them as they are unworthy.  Some tiny little glimmer in her peeks out  and she ends up intervening in the life of the husband of the young couple  when  the wife disappears and the husband  is a suspect (and she has seen another man with the wife).  Very difficult to read and harder to put down and, while true to itself, nothing is as it seems.  Psychological thrillers are not my favorite, this was recommended by a friend, and was compelling."
"""Twice a day, I am offered a view into other lives, just for a moment. There’s something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home.”Rachel Watson rides the train to and from London every weekday. The train stops at the same faulty signal, near where Rachel use to live with her then-husband, Tom. While waiting at the signal, she looks into her favorite track-side house, hoping to see the man and woman who live there. Although Rachel doesn't know them, she calls them Jess and Jason. Rachel has woven a fantasy about them, and they have the perfect life. Except they don’t.Desperately unhappy, Rachel has developed a drinking problem. She is unable to accept that Tom has remarried and lives with his new wife and their baby in the house he shared with Rachel. Rachel has made a nuisance of herself to the point of harassment--calling Tom repeatedly and stopping by to see him, especially after she’s been drinking.What Rachel sees from the train one day will compel her to insert herself into Jess and Jason’s lives and put her own in danger.This story was quick-paced and hard to put down. Although I cringed at some of the things Rachel did, her character was so well-developed, I could sympathize with her. The Girl on the Train is an excellent debut novel, and I can’t wait for more from this author. I highly recommend this book for readers who like a taut, well-written psychological thriller."
"This is not a good book. The ""twist"" was obvious early on and not much of a surprise. What is with these female novelists who write these absolutely pitiful female characters who are so dependent on a man and popping out babies to give them social status that they are utterly broken and inoperable without these things. BOO!"
"This book started off slow for me.  And I thought a little confusing.  I kept getting bored and putting the book down.  I also didn't like the main character.  Then about midway the whole tenor of the story changed.  But I still couldn't get in to it.  Then, bam, near the end the story picked up speed and turned very intense.  And I still didn't care what happened to the characters!I like a good mystery but this one was convoluted with unsympathetic characters.  I was sorry I wasted my time."
"3.5 stars actually. I was a fan of Gone Girl and this book is structured similarly. The first half was really suspenseful but, just like with Gone Girl, I figured out about half way through who the real villain was. That takes some of the suspense and enjoyment out of the reading. Another issue I had  is that the entire narrative depends on the main character's frequent and complete alcoholic blackouts. Now granted I don't know much about alcoholic blackouts but they seemed a bit too convenient in terms of the narrative. In fact, without them, the entire plot wouldn't exist. So, in summary, if you liked Gone Girl you'll probably like this one just don't expect to be too surprised when the killer is revealed."
"I read the reviews prior to buying, and I assumed I wouldn't be able to put it down, as many other reviewers stated. Actually, the opposite happened. I just wasn't too interested nor involved in this book. It took me a while to finish, which is a disappointment for me. I kept reading, hoping that it would get better, and it just didn't for me. Sure, the story offers some twists and turns, but it was just too slow. My life is not changed after reading it, as I like for it to be after reading a great book. Other reviewers say it is similar to ""Gone Girl,"" and was recommended to me after I read ""The Kind Worth Killing,"" both books in which I gave 5 star ratings to. This book is a shame compared to those. It just did not keep me intrigued."
"This story moves, propelling the reader onward.  The author is a good and descriptive writer and gives an immediate impression of the gist of each of the characters she follows.  If you are looking for a suspense read that will pull you in and make you want to finish the book in a weekend, this does the trick.Rachel, the ""Girl on the Train,"" who imagines the lives of a couple whose house she passes every day, is a drunk.  Daily, her train also passes the house she used to call home, now inhabited by her ex-husband and the woman he left Rachel for.  Twice daily on her commute, Rachel alternately mourns for the life she lost (and curses the women who supplanted her) and imagines the perfect couple down the street from her old home whom she views from her commuter's window but doesn't know.  Maybe due to her reliance on being drunk to cope with a life that has severely disappointed her, Rachel often is hesitant to act when contemplating a decision.  This does make some of the chapters repetitious at times, but the author's strong sense of place and use of description largely mitigates this criticism.Comparison's to Rear Window are obvious.  As with the Hitchcock masterpiece, Rachel gets involved when she witnesses an incident from her train that is out of sync with the imagined life of the couple she views every day - the couple about whom she has constructed a vivid, if alcohol fueled, perfect life.  There are a lot of plot twists, though this is the kind of book where most of them are revealed by the three protagonists and not pieced together from a well laid foundation of clues.A good book, quick read and pretty good freshman effort from this author."
"A fast moving story involving several people. Those being Rachel (The Girl on the train) Tom her ex husband Annie his current wife, Megan the woman who goes missing and Scott,  Megan's husband. Of course also members of the Constabulary . When Rachel was married to Tom she was not able to bear children and eventually she became more fond of the bottle than anything else. This quite often led her to have trouble recognising what was real and what was a dream. The story is narrated by the 3 women and explains to you what was going on with their lives. So long as you don't mind a bit of foul language the story is quite gripping and even though it is of fiction what happens probably happens a lot more than we realise.Well worth a read."
"Well, thanks to Joe Hill my interest in reading has reached a high I haven't reached since 5th grade, when I read classic, Elementary books such as ""Holes"", ""Where the Red Fern Grows"", and some other titles I can't pull out of my ass right now.Joe Hill's books created a reading monster, and before I even finished ""NOS4A2"" I order Paula Hawkin's, ""The Girl on the Train"", a first person narrative about an alcoholic, divorced lady, Rachel, who's black-out antics may or may not have lead her to kill a blonde whom most likely reminds her of Anna, the woman who Rachel's husband left her for. In contrast to the tremendous, fantasy, 3rd person writing of Joe Hill, ""The Girl on The Train"", is rather straight foreword.This doesn't make ""The Girl on the Train"" bad, I love the book! Read it, it's a really quick read and it puts its reader in the shoes of multiple characters with a clever-ease that isn't confusing like I've found some other novels to be. But...if you're picking this book up after reading possibly one of the best books of your life, prepare to plateau in dissapointment.In vulgar terms, it's like if you dated a guy with a ten incher and you both break up, then get with a guy who's like 7 and a half inches. See the new guy is big, but he's not a porn star, and that makes your downstairs mixup, quite sad."
"The book departs from a good premise. Rachel, a conflicted woman (not a girl by any chance) spying on her former husbands new wife and some neighbors which houses rest in the path of the train that she takes every morning to work. Or to pretend she works. She's a full blown alcoholic drifting on a world of fantasy.Cleverly, Hawkins jumps from her point of view, narrated as a diary of sorts, to the view the three women in the novel. The observed neighbor, Megan, who has a complicated life and demeanor far from Rachel imagination. And Anna, her former husband's new wife.The conflicting POV work fine for a while, until half the book. There it stumbles a bit with contrived twists. Perhaps the weaker point of the novel (spoilers aside) is that in many ways pretends to be a whodunit, with a very small pool of suspects. The best point is the characterization of the women (all of them, even Rachel's roommate, poor old good-sport Claire; exception noted for non convincing detective Riley), and the misogynous dark world they inhabit, where beyond roleplaying as companions, mothers, wives, lovers, sinners or victims, there's not much left for them to aspire.Good first fiction effort by Hawkins."
"This story got my attention from the first page and I truly enjoyed the whole ride. When writing this review, I was trying to find something that I didn't like about it,to be fair, but couldn’t find anything and this is what my 5 star rating shows.The plot basically revolves around Rachel, who takes the same commuter train every day and suddenly sees something rather than usual, that changes her life for ever. This particularly event and a few mental-life crisis moments will make Rachel figure out that what is in front of you, sometimes is not always what it seems to be.It is told through the voice of three different women, which gives the narrative a more clear insight and adds mystery to the story.I have read Gone Girl before and I can say is one of my favorite thrillers of all time.I thought I was hardly ever gonna have the opportunity to read something similar to it, but let me tell you, I did and it was thanks to Paula Hawkins.There were sometimes that I couldn't believe what I was reading, it has an original  storyline that keeps your hearth pounding, gripping and wanting for more. I totally recommend it.Favorite Quotes:- “Life is not a paragraph, and death is no parenthesis.”-“I have never understood how people can blithely disregard the damage they do by following their hearts.”- “It's  possible to miss what you’ve never had, to mourn for it.”-“The holes in your life are permanent. You have to grow around them, like tree roots around concrete; you mould yourself through the gaps.”-“I’ve been the fool. If he does it with you, he’ll do it to you.”"
"This is a page turner. I was completely engaged in the story and always in suspense. I loved how the writing alternated between characters and how you really get in their head and yet see what they think of the others! The alcoholism was accurately portrayed. So glad I did not watch the movie first as I wanted to create my own visuals and see if the director was able to bring it. Good movie but disappointing in regard to being true to the story and bringing the suspense. For one the setting takes place in the USA in the movie. Wtf? I wanted it to be in England! Too many things missing from the movie as well, but thats the way it is. Books are ALWAYS better! Great read. I recommended it to my friends and they were NOT disappointed!"
"As appears on Goodreads.com I finished this on St. Paddy's Day and I'm still torn between 3 and 4 Stars. Author, Paula Hawkins had me spell bound. Her writing is fierce - she certainly knows how to spend a very suspenseful tale, keeping the reader quickly turning the pages despite ALL of her very unlikeable characters.Rachel is Tom Watson's ex-wife. She is quite pathetic. She's a drunk and unemployed. But each morning she rides the train to London (to save face) pretending she's just another commuter. And the train always stops very near her old house where she was happy and hopeful with Tom. A few doors down live a beautiful couple that she's dubbed ""Jess and Jason."" She imagines their life together, giving them wonderful attributes and marriage. Looks can be deceiving as the real ""Jess"" - Meagan - shows us. Tom's current wife hates Rachel and truly believes that Tom's ex-wife is unstable and dangerous to her, Tom, and their baby daughter. Everything is going as smoothly as each woman's situation can go until one of them suddenly disappears. Rachel must interject herself in the investigation. After all, she's invested a year of mornings and evenings watching this woman. Bad decision, girlfriend.The story line is told from each of the three women's altering POV, and that technique is powerful and makes the novel work. As I've said there is not one redeemable or likeable character in the whole book, but the reader is also a Rachel - a voyeur of a sort like in ""Rear Window."" Something bad has happened and we know it's coming and we can't shut our eyes. We readers must know what happened and by whose hands."
Wow...this book had many twists and turns...really enjoyed it..there were times when I could not put the book down..Great Read
"I only wish she diddnt end up alone... And that the girls would have stayed friends, and that the guy would have suffered more."
"Ugh....it took everything in me to even get to page 50, at which time I skimmed quickly to the end and wasn't impressed at all.  If you like Gone Girl then you'll like this.  I liked neither."
"So well written, such a twist! I usually figure out rather quickly who did it but this one kept me guessing! A must read!"
"It was an interesting way to read a book, from several points of view. I kept wondering how it was all going to pull together."
Better than the movie
"I can't decide if I really liked this book or not. I kept reading just to find out the who and why, but found it hard to like any of the people."
Confusing at times in the beginning and then frustrating at other times. Keeps you off balance and eventually you can't put it down.
Great read!
"It was alright. TBH I don't understand all the hype about it, but it was a pleasant enough read. I wanted to scream at the heroine throughout pretty much the whole book. I think my biggest problem with the book was that I didn't actually like any of the characters in it, not even a supporting character. I found it hard to connect with the story because of that."
It kept me reading wanting to know what would happen next! A good mystery with a little twist.
Great read
I could not stop reading this book! The characters felt so real. It is a must read! Highly recommended! :)
It think I was expecting a lot more going into it. It wasn't terrible but it was a little too dramatic for my taste.
LOVED it!
I'm not usually into mystery/thrillers but this was very entertaining! It is a little slow to start but it makes up for it later. Just read it.
Loved loved loved this book.
great book
Quick read. Suspenseful till the end. I enjoyed it up until the very end. Surprise ending that I never saw coming.
The Girl On the Train was a really good read. Kept me guessing until the end. The author really captures the voice of the main characters. Great job.
Boring!
"I liked the story, but wasn't thrilled."
This book builds on events slowly but keeps the reader engaged all the way to the end. I would recommend this to all my reading friends!
"The book's opening chapters grabbed and held my interest. Then my interest began waning and quickly was transformed to annoyance, impatience, outright irritation and finally, full-blown dislike. I ended up really disliking this book. I thought the plot was so implausible and contrived - and, of course, many suspense/mystery novels are implausible and contrived, but this is yet another one of the type that has no foot in reality - as to be unacceptable. It veered into absurdity. More than that, however, was my increasingly intense dislike for all of the characters - every single one of them, but probably most of all, the main character, Rachel. I found her alcoholism, her black-outs, her laxity, her passivity, her strange behavior even outside of her alcoholic binges, everything about her just repugnant. But that was true of every character for different reasons and to varying degrees of dislike. The stylistic technique of alternating ""voices"" was OK and the different female characters represented in those voices were fairly well distinguished, enough so as to follow ""their chapters.""  One thing that I did appreciate, and it stands on contrast to ""Gone Girl"", was the absence of detailed, specific, ""graphic"" sexual material. There were indirect references but we weren't forced into the beds, bodies and minds of people in sexual encounters - and I appreciated that!  I didn't find any obvious type or similar types of editing errors, also appreciated. I thought the basic style and quality of writing was OK, outside of plot. Character development was OK, but they were just so thoroughly unlikeable and unlikely, in my opinion.2016 has been a year that for me, as an enthusiastic reader, has been a year in which I have learned to distrust blurbs, critics, and reviews in general.  I have read too many books this year that were glowingly reviewed, best-selling, even award nominees - and yet left me thinking:  where have all the great novels gone? Do I have to return to beloved books of the past and re-read?Apparently plenty of people like this book a lot. I'm not one of them."
Very suspenseful. This book will keep you on the edge of your seat and engulf you the entire time. One of my new favorites.
I got a chance to read over a 3day Christmas break.I didn't put it down.A must read before they make the movie
Fantastic book! A page turner for sure!
It was a fun read. I enjoyed the main character and could identify with her struggles and pain. She was very real
It's a hard one to ever put day
Good Read
"Didn't like the characters, and found the plot very predictable."
"It took me 50 pages before I understand what was going on and that there were actually three different people's point of view. Once that happened the book was amazing. I was on the edge of my seat all the way to the end. The only reason I gave it four stars and not five was because there were too many spelling errors. Being an English major, this drives me crazy. If you need someone to proofread your book, let me know. I'm free"
"Starts as a chick flick, then shows out as down and dirty drama.so different from other normal style of explaining real life.just buy it."
Good book.
The story line was too slow until the end when the story was reaching it's conclusion.  I lost sympathy with the main character as her behavior got boring and unrealistic.
As good as Gone Girl. I could not stop reading and finished in one day.
"when you need something new to read, this book might be interesting"
Would have been a five if they didn't talk like sailors.
Suspense that never let's up and keeps you turning the pages.
"A page turner! I couldn't put this book down! Sitting at the edge of my seat! I'm sad it's over, I hope a second book will come out!!!"
"I very much enjoyed this book. It was nearing the end before I figured everything out, and although there were some reveals I had not seen coming, nothing was out of sync with the portrayal of the characters. It was all one of those ""oh, that makes sense now"". With the back-and-forth chapters between characters and time, I would have done better with a hard copy of the book as opposed to the Kindle version as I couldn't remember the dates/times well enough without needing to look back (which is too much of a pain on Kindle for me to mess with). However, once each chapter started, it was pretty easy to keep up with whether the timeline was past or present so it wasn't a problem and made the story more intriguing than if were told straightforward. There were moments of suspense, but for me it was more thoughtful as I tried to work through what each character had been through, what they were feeling, the struggle with their past and their present, and how it affected their actions along the way as the book built up to ""what really happened"". I will read this one again."
"This book is appropriately titled because it's like watching a train wreck - you simply can't look away. Mesmerized from the beginning, I could not put the book down until I was finished. I HAD to know the end.One review I read called it ""Hitchcockian"" and I could not agree more. It reminded me of the movie Rear Window. Told from three different women's points of view, The Girl On The Train is a suspense thriller at it's finest.I am a character driven reader and writer and the characters in this book are written brilliantly. Rachel is a literal train wreck herself but the author wrote her in such a way that I felt sorry enough for her to want to know her story. And I really wanted things to work out for her. The other characters were so full of mystery and intrigue I felt unease about each one, never truly knowing them or what they would do next.And I loved how the book ended. The author didn't leave the reader with frustrating unknowns but wraps it up in a way where I was satisfied but can't stop thinking about the story. Brilliant. Excellent read."
"I'm flabbergasted by the rave reviews, especially that there are 17,500+ mostly positive reviews. At the 20% mark, I debated ending the boredom since nothing had happened yet. Once I got to about 50%, I was still bored and confused about what all the fuss what about because still nothing much had happened. But I slogged through and finished, and I'm still shaking my head. Not one of the seven main characters is likable. Most of them drink heavily. The pacing is slow and repetitive. The book felt so amateurish that I really question what has happened to the reading public that books like this and Gone Girl, another poorly written and over-hyped mess, are so popular. Are books with fully developed characters and carefully crafted plots too challenging for people? I just don't get it."
"What a waste of time.  This book is getting lots of attention while it should be ignored.  I should have put it down when 4D (Drunk, Depressed, Ditzy, Destructive) protagonist continues haranguing the ex-husband.  This one is hard to stomach, 4D has no clue as to her ex's character?  She goes to work for months after being fired? 4D can't remember what she did while drinking but later in the book does.  The only cheat the author didn't succumb to is magic."
"Rachel rides the train every day past her old neighborhood and feels regret for the life she used to have.  She sees the new neighbors and imagines the life they're living.  Somehow she gets involved when the woman she's been watching goes missing, but Rachel is a raging drunk and her memory is sketchy at best.This felt like it took forever to read, none of the characters were likeable,.  However, I did learn that gin and tonic is available in a can, so there you go."
"Meh.  I wasn't very impressed.  While the story line was okay, I felt that it was predictable.  I think all the hype set me up for disappointment.  I felt that a lot of things were repeated, and grew tired of reading the same types of details used to describe the characters.  I thought it was interesting when the author went into detail about alcohol induced blackouts, but once again, mentioned it so many times, which played a part in the predictability.  The way the story wrapped up was especially jarring and disappointing.  it was unrealistic, and again, contributed to it's predictability.  its a short and somewhat enjoyable read, and many people enjoy it.  If you're looking for a book to jolt your senses, push buttons, or affect your emotions in any way, this book is not for you."
"This novel was a page turner for me.  I hated putting it down.  However, none of the characters is likeable and they are all rather depressing.  That doesn't bother me, as I like novels that have interesting character development.  I did think most of the characters and many of the events were unrealistic and over the top, but that is true of many novels. Think of science fiction and fantasy novels, for example.Rachel, the main character was an alcoholic and I kept hoping she would straighten up and quit drinking.  Much of the time I just wanted to shake her for making repeated poor decisions.  Her ex-husband Tom had left her for Anna.  They had a baby, something Rachel had not been able to do.  Anna and Tom seemed to be happy, but then he was cheating with Megan whom he hired to be a babysitter.  The story is told in alternating chapters by these three women.As I said, the novel kept me reading and wanting to know what would happen next.  I kept trying to figure out who was a reliable narrator and who committed the murder.  It was well written too. I guessed who the murderer was after reading about 80% of the book, but I occasionally thought I might be wrong.Even though I liked it a lot, it is not a book that I'm likely to remember a few years from now, perhaps because several of the situations seemed contrived."
"A got drawn into this book as much for the story about the dark journey of an alcoholic hitting bottom as for the tale of whodunnit.  I felt the author was quite good at detailing with accuracy and nuance the bizarre, guilt ridden, unreasonable inner world of a woman lost in blackout drinking.  The main character is pathetic, but she is sympathetic enough that I found her ultimately heroic.The author adeptly crafted a whodunnit tale with enough twists and turns, weaving a web of storylines with just enough believability that kept me guessing long enough.The authors strength was her keen understanding of the human mind at it's darker limits, reminding me a bit of what I loved so much about Crime and Punishment."
"I couldn't wait for this book to be over. I purchased it because it was on the 'recommended' list if you had enjoyed A. Doerr's exquisite novel  All the Light We Cannot See...which is on my top 10 forever list. It is unfathomable to determine the logic used to couple it with Doerr's masterpiece, but I assume this is why Hawkin's book has sold so well.There was not one character with whom to develop a  hopeful compassion (key ingredient) and draw you in intimately. I hung in and kept reading The Girl on the Train thinking Hawkins would somehow pull it off but alas...the depressing story  laid itself flat all the way to it's merciful conclusion.  Save your money. Pick up Lady in Gold and All the Light we Cannot see and sink into something you wish had no last page."
"Rachel is fat.  Fat fat Rachel.  Rachel drinks.  Drinks, Rachel, drink.  Rachel is unlikable.  Poor, poor Rachel.  Add in ex-husband Tom, who is shown to have about as much personality as paste.  New wife Anna, who slept with Tom while he was married to Rachel, and seems to exist primarily to whine about Fat Rachel (and Anna can't seem to think of Rachel without saying that she's Fat).  Scott, who sleeps with Rachel even though she's Fat and his wife has been murdered, and Megan, the murdered wife who has a history, but again no personality.  And finally, Rachel's roommate who exists solely to complain about Rachel's drinking.Dull.  Tedious.  You don't care about any of the characters.  And you can't really guess who dunnit as there are so few clues.Ah, well, if cured my insomnia for a while."
"It took me a bit to get invested in this book, but once I did I was hooked. The premise is basically a woman, who is an alcoholic rides a train every day and passes a house where a couple live, and makes up names and a happy, perfect life for them, and then one day something happens. That's about as much as I got from the blurb, and as I didn't read any other reviews, it took me awhile to figure out how this could even be interesting. However, there is much more to this story. The author fills in the plot holes slowly, and through different perspectives, but it all comes together. There's a twist at the end I began suspecting, but then when it came it was still gratifyingly good. The main character, Rachel, is pretty frustrating, but it's nice that she gets her, for lack of a better word-balls about her there at the end. They're making a movie of this with Emily Blunt and I'm very excited to see that adaptation as well. Great read."
I have NO IDEA why this is #1 on the best seller list. It is OK not great. Read this book if you are on vacation or taking a flight and want a book that won't make you think. It's an easy read. None of the characters make you want to care about them or solve the case.
"Read from November 29 to December 01, 2015 I can't really write a review because I think I'm lost somewhere in the book. Paula Hawkins has a vivid imagination and a talent for sharing it with us in the form of a book. There needs to be 'other' characters besides the 'main' characters, and there are. But I found myself getting ahead of the writer with my own assumptions and a couple of characters are left scratching their heads and squinting their eyes wondering when there turn will come or that's how I see them.I wanted to be surprised in the end and I wasn't. I was even a little disappointed, but that could be my own vivid imagination getting in the way. I may even go back and read the last few chapters to see what I may have missed.4 stars for The Girl on the Train. I really did like it. I liked the concept of the part the train played in it all, a very good character by the way. I do recommend the book. Maybe someone can fill in some of the gaps for me. (less)"
"I found the character of Rachel to be quite enjoyable, just because she's so difficult to like. In fact, all the characters in this book are difficult to like. They're all flawed. They all do awful things and are general a-holes. Still, you can't help but look at them and wonder if you see pieces of yourself in them. Have you ever cheated on someone? Been cheated on? Lied? Been a little too violent in an argument with a SO? Drunk-dialed/texted an ex, over and over, or just embarrassed yourself by being able to let go? Made a fool of yourself? Came to work hung over and useless? It's a good read, for sure. I'm sure reviewers like to use words like ""unflinching"" to describe it.I personally just enjoy books with characters that beat back the stereotypes. Rachel totally did that. She's overweight and totally makes a fool of herself repeatedly. You're disgusted by her weakness, and yet if you've ever been in a relationship, especially one that ended poorly, you can probably feel a glimmer of understanding.Hollywood will undoubtedly make this into an unrecognizable mess. But oh well, such is life."
"""Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning. Every day she rattles down the track, flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes, and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck. She's even started to feel like she knows them. ""Jess and Jason,"" she calls them. Their life - as she sees it - is perfect. Not unlike the life she recently lost. And then she sees something shocking. It's only a minute until the train moves on, but it's enough. Now everything's changed. Unable to keep it to herself, Rachel offers what she knows to the police, and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next, as well as in the lives of everyone involved. Has she done more harm than good?""I found ""The Girl on the Train"" by Paula Hawkins hard to put down; it's definitely a page turner with many quirks. I've read that Hawkins is being compared to Gillian Flynn which is difficult as this is Hawkins' debut novel, but I'm hoping Hawkins continues in this genre.I enjoyed the way that Hawkins draws you in, the way that you think you know what is happening; but as the story unfolds you start to question Rachel and her judgement. I did realise whodunnit, but this didn't detract from the novel (as I was near the end) but it was the circumstances and the characters who were the true ""twist"".Four and a half stars - I look forward to Hawkins next novel."
"This book is told from three different perspectives: Rachel is an alcoholic who rides the train to and from London every day, watching the houses and imagining the peoples’ lives. Megan is one of those people, and she spends every day fighting within her own head about what to do — does she still likes her husband, or should she run away? Anna is the new wife of Tom, Rachel’s ex-husband. They live in Rachel’s old house with their baby girl, Evie. Rachel, depressed with how her life has turned out, spends her days drinking, usually ending with making a rude, drunken call to Tom.One day, Rachel sees Megan’s face in the news — she’s gone missing. Rachel has to battle her blackouts — she knows she saw something important, but she can’t remember. She knows she has to help.This book, widely regarded as the next “Gone Girl,” is a psychological thriller. It’s a strange feeling, as a reader, when the main character is such an unlikeable woman who is unwilling to help herself. However, with more and more information, more revelations, you begin to see why she is how she is. She has to fight for herself, for people to believe her, to have purpose in the world. “The Girl on the Train” is a solid thriller and I will definitely be reading any future books from Paula Hawkins."
"I didn't really sense any ""suspense"" in this novel until I reached the half way point. I was annoyed with keeping track of chapters with dates, and there are three different female voices which makes this a difficult type of book to read on a Kindle. I almost quit half way through the book because I just didn't like anyone in the story. However, I'm glad I finished it because the author did eventually bring the story to a satisfying conclusion. I have read reviews that compare it to Gone Girl and it doesn't rise to that level at all. I think I would have edited out half the alcoholic stupors for Rachel because I just got tired of her reasons and excuses for being how she was. The book is simply Okay."
"This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  It was a page turning psychological thriller that was hard to put down and can easily finished in a day or afternoon of reading.  The main character, Rachel, is somewhat of a sad case that has not gotten over her failed marriage to Tom, who has moved on with another woman, Anna and recently had a child (something she was unable to give him).  As if the divorce and her inability to have children is not enough, Rachel is constantly reminded of Tom’s new life without her every day as she passes by their home that was once hers on the train each day.  She is obsessed with them and their neighbor Megan and her husband.  The story is told from the perspective of the three women; Rachel, Anna and Megan.  As Rachel’s life continues to disintegrate throughout the novel, her obsession with the couples along with her drinking problem continues to get worse.  As her life falls apart, she becomes engrossed with Megan’s disappearance and trying to solve what happened to her.  With the three perspective stories the reader is left trying to figure out what eventually happens to Megan upon her disappearance and how all three women are connected.  The climax and ending of the book is truly shocking and will leave you wanting more from Paula Hawkins.  The plot would make an excellent movie and I am looking forward to more work from this author."
"Great read!! I rarely give 5 Stars but this book totally deserves it.I loved the plot; a very sad, lonely, drunk, yet sympathetic woman cannot seem to let her ex husband go and move on with her life. She certainly has reason to be angry with him, he dumped her for another woman, but 2 years later she is still obsessed to the point of losing everyone and everything in her life. At times you really feel for her but other times you just want to shake her and tell her to get over it.One drunken night, while she (Rachel), acts on an impulse and decides to show up at her ex husband's house, she finds herself in the middle out of a missing persons investigation.The story is told alternately between the points of view of Rachel, Anna (former mistress, current wife of Rachel's ex) and Megan (missing women).  As the plot unfolds, we find out more about each woman, their lives, histories and motives. We also realize how little people really know about others and how outside impressions can be very deceiving.While reading this book, I didn't really find myself reflecting on the writing style. To me, that means it was written seamlessly for the story. The book was easy to get hooked on, I couldn't put it down once I got started. The ending was not what I had expected. Although  the 'bad guy' was one of several on my list, I really didn't figure it out until very near the end.I highly recommend reading this book. I'd love to hear others thoughts on it. It would make a great book club read."
"I have not been intrigued by a new novel, in quite some time, as I have a habit of sticking to my favourite authors.  When I read the premise for 'The Girl on the Train', I was so curious and excited, I immediately bought a copy of the novel.In short, I liked the book....but I did not love it.  I enjoyed the diary format, the 3 person point of view, and I even thought that it was very interesting and refreshing that the author made each of the characters quite unsavoury and almost un-likeable.  What caused me to rate this story less than a perfect 5 stars is that, although it was very readable, it seemed that certain scenes were repetitious, especially noticeable with Rachel.  And... Although the ending was good, it just seemed anticlimactic.I am also quite curious about what this author does next and how ""The Girl on the Train"" translates to film."
Gripping and compelling the whole time. Unpredictable twists and drama throughout the book. I can't wait to see the movie.
"definitely not for me, not for man"
What an amazing story!  I literally did not take a break from beginning to end.  So many plot twists and turns!  Awesome!
A riveting mystery. Don't try to watch tv while reading this or you will be confused.
"Entertaining and quick read. However, if you are a law and order junkie like myself, a bit predictable.  Good beach read."
"Wow,  I couldn't put it down.  Rachel's voice  is so real my heart ached for her.  A page turner to the very end."
Great suspense!
My first read by this author. Good writing and she definitely pulls you in. The book keeps twisting right to the end.
This book just grabs you! Could not put down. Had me thinking about it for days after I finished the book.
A great novel with many twists. It will keep your attention right to the great ending. It was hard to put down.
"This book  had me enthralled from the start , the ""heroine"" of the book evoked feelings of sympathy as she stumbled through her life , a victim of a cruel  heartbreak  which leaves her as a pitiful victim , though it is easy to understand her despair and feel for her as she weaves her fantasy to distract and escape from the hopelessness and unfairness  of her situation .  This is a compelling thriller and I really couldn't put it down. Was the conclusion as twisted and clever as I would have hoped? I can't say it left me with a big ""wow"" factor as I would have liked but still a satisfying conclusion. I like the way the 3 female characters were involved in the storytelling and like all good books I became emotionaly involved in some way with each character .  Defiantly a good read I recommend it."
"...then read this book. Otherwise, skip it. I promise. One day, I will find the person who took the bribe cash to get this $16 cinder block onto the NY Times Bestseller List, and I will not allow them to get away from me until they are able to recite the definitions for ""Hitchcockian"" and ""psychological thriller"" from memory.The writing is stilted, the timeline is funky, the flat characters are pancake flat, and the main and round characters are written just well enough to keep you from beating your face in with whatever vehicle is carrying this work to your unfortunate retinas. If anything, this book made me wonder what type of activities the author had time to engage in while writing it, because she clearly wasn't working on any kind of character or plot development."
"I finished this book a few days ago after several people at work started reading it and saying how good it was, so I of course had to read it. But whoa was I not prepared for my mind being blown and all over the place with the writing style. I enjoy a book that gives point of view from different people don't get me wrong,but when there is so much switching back and forth and with dates involved it becomes too much. And once I finished I sat there for a good 5 minutes still in shock, because of who did it and my unanswered questions. Overall I would say I liked it, but it won't be a book I would read again, it took me well over half the book just to get into it like everyone else did. But it's worth a read, and four stars."
"The Girl on the Train had my attention at times, other times I felt like I was just trying to get to the end. The main character, Rachel, is a divorced, jobless, alcoholic. She shows up at her old house (which is now being lived in by her ex, his new wife and their daughter) and doesn't remember it the next day as she suffers from alcoholic amnesia. She makes up a pretend life for the people that live a few doors down from her old house as she passes them by everyday as she pretends to go to work. She then learns the woman in said house is now missing. She was in the area that night but cannot remember anything because of a blackout. The story then goes on with Rachel trying to fill in the missing pieces that night.This story is told from three different pov. We have Rachel, the amnesiac alcoholic, Anne, the mistress and now wife of Rachel's ex, and Megan, the now missing woman with a lot of secrets. Most of the characters in this book are rather bleak. The only one I found likeable was Rachel's roomate. I think she may be the only sane one in the bunch. This book could be redundant at times with Rachel always drinking but never remember what happened. But she somehow found her way home each time.I give it three stars because it was an okay read. I probably wouldn't recommend it to my friends but if you can't find anything to read this book can pass the time."
"This books is pretty good-- not amazing. Many others have already given a synopsis, so here are my pros/cons:Pros:-The book is a quick read and is entertaining.- I liked the overall story quite a bit (the writing style was lacking)- I hate when I solve the mystery too early. This one had me guessing for quite some time, and the ending was believable-- accomplishing both of those tasks is rare.Cons:- The writing style. The story is told in first person from 3 different characters, but the style never changed from character to character. They felt one-dimensional and the change in perspective seemed more like a device to tell the story than anything else.- I didn't like any of the characters. This doesn't bother some people, but I like having someone to root for.- While the ending was believable, it felt rushed. Once you figure out what happened, you get about 10-15 pages of resolution.I'd recommend this book as a fun, (relatively) cheap read. Not a must-read by any means, but I enjoyed the book."
"The movie, primarily because of Emily Blunt's acting, is much better than the novel.  Emily Blunt kept my interest.  The novel took way too long to get moving so that I was ""ho hum"" when are we going to get on with what's actually happening here. I gave the movie three stars because Blunt's five star performance averaged out the ho hum tediousness of the novel's story line.  I can't for the life of me figure out why the novel became such best seller."
"I have no problem tossing a book to the side after a couple of chapters if I don't like it. This one I wanted to throw across the room! I just can't understand the good reviews, but I had to keep reading to see if I could figure it out. I never did.I tried skimming once I got halfway through, but it wasn't easy. The book is told from the point of view of different characters but they all sound the same. Not to worry, you know you're reading about the main character if she is constantly worried about her next drink.This trend of going back and forth, writing chapters from the perspective of different characters and at different times (which she also does) can be the mark of a lazy writer. It takes time to create a single narrator, and I don't think this writer had the skill."
"I loved  this book I read it twice which I have never done before. if you were a heavy drinker or if you knew one in your life you will relate to Rachel, who is the main character in this book. the beginning was hard to follow for me. the book is told in three characters Rachel, megan, and anna. who by the way are all connected in  some way which you find out as you get to know these people. Rachel gives a lot of misinformation thru out the book aka blackouts dreams ect. related to her being an alcoholic which adds a Hitchcock feel to this story. it is a mystery novel . the book is slow in the beginning till you get to know who megan and anna  are, but hold on the book takes off like a running train lots of twists in this. Rachel was awesome throughout the whole book and the ending is awesome  I can't get Rachel out of my head!!! without giving anything away you will have a different perspective for Rachel and be amazed of what she can do in a crisis.  I hope there is sequel"
"This was a book I could not put down.That being said, in some ways, many ways in fact, it reminded me too much of Gone Girl.Perhaps this is the London version of Gone Girl.Girl on the Train is fast-paced, riveting and engrossing.I could not feel any sympathy for any of the characters. Rachel was a victim of her own habits, clumsy, dull, needy and relentlessly foolish in her behavior. I simply wanted to shake her and tell her to leave well enough alone, but then of course there would be no story, no conflict.Anna and Megan were shallow, greedy and wanting and taking what wasn't rightfully theirs to take. Megan's wanton nature did her in. Hers was a sad little life that might have turned out better if she had made better choices.Anna's life was a full circle, ""what goes around comes around"" tale.And the men were despicable brutish abusers!Seldom have I disliked so many characters in a novel!I did enjoy the book, but compared to Gone Girl it was a bit disappointing. It was written in the same style.. First one character's narrative, then another's, but the adversaries in Gone Girl were clearly more clever,  more attractive and even more resourceful.Though there were twists and turns, Girl on the Train was plodding in places and I really don't care what Rachel does next!"
"I heard this book being hyped as the next Gone Girl, but it definitely isn't.  It's a good book, don't get me wrong, but I just felt like the story was sloppy... Maybe because Rachel was so sloppy with her drinking and her behavior (and in turn her narration) but it's hard to get behind a character that is so non like-able.  Maybe if there had been more telling about her relationship with Tom in the beginning, so you are able to develop some sympathy for her before you meet her as a black out drunk.  I don't know.*SPOILERS*All that aside, I did spend the whole book trying to formulate who I thought was the culprit, and at one point I was thinking that it could have been Rachel that killed Megan so obviously the plot was well written and spun together.  I had suspicions early on about what was going on with Megan and I was right about those assumptions, but did not expect the end with Anna.So overall, a good read that kept my interest... the comparisons to Gone Girl though really set it up to disappoint some readers I think though."
"Truly keeps you guessing to the very end! I read this in 3 days, very surprising. Can't wait for the film."
I couldn't put the book down! There were twist and turns on each page. Never would have guessed who the killer is
I couldn't put it down once I started reading it.
Loved it!
Both my mother and I read and enjoyed the story.  Look forward to reading another book by this author soon.
Started a bit slow and the middle was a bit boring and confusing towards the middle. Was shocked by the ending.
Couldn't let it go. Bestseller!
Good mystery telling the story from different points of view
Just get it.  A great read
Great read.
When I started reading I was like what is this but quickly I got taken in and then couldn't put it down. Great read
I did not really enjoy the book.  It seemed too long for the story.
Fabulous book
A page turner for sure! Great!
I enjoy thrillers and this book lived up to the hype. I was on the edge of my seat til the last page. Loved it!!
This was a great thriller! I  couldn't put it down.  Great escape!  I didn't want it to end. Great read!
Kept me guessing the whole time. I was on the edge of my seat. Never saw it coming. Good read!
Great book. Couldn't put it down.
I do recommend the book. It is easy to read and  keeps you in good suspense for a while. The end is a little predictable.
I enjoyed the way the novel was sewn and woven in time. It was a very improbable plot but empowering to know that the bully got his due.
I loved how well this book was written and the story.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves thrillers
"Hard to put down this weird, weird book!"
Excellent book.  Look forward to seeing the movie.
What a thriller. The book makes you think you know- until you don't! Great read. Can't wait to see the movie.
The main character was an alcoholic and  consequently she couldn't remember or justify her behavior.  Plot was confusing and weak.
"Good start, somewhat slow in the middle but an really unexpected ending!!! Wow!!!"
"A quick, intense and insane romp through the lives of a few folks who you know could be your neighbors...despite your hope that they are not."
"Anyone that likes multiple viewpoints of the same scene this book is for you. Intrigue, suspense, murder, and lust make this book intense and believable."
Fantastic book. Haven't seen the film but the book was great
Loved this book...it keeps interests and moves very well. one if those hard to out down books.
I enjoyed this book. I liked the character development. I did have to go back from time to time to see which character I was reading about and the story was choppy at times but I loved the final chapters and couldn't put it down since I just had to know what was going to happen. I liked the premise of someone on a train fantasizing about the lives of the people they watch daily from a train window. I hope to read more from this author.
"Overall liked the book - but it is not something I would re-visit as (1) There is not too much sub-text or character details that I want to re-visit after the reveal and  **spoilers ahead**(2) though there is some attempt at describing and analyzing issues related to infertility, baby death, alcoholism, the author does not dig too deeply to surface the complexity around them. For e.g. it would have been great to know more about the killer - not the motivation, which was clearly laid out, but just more about the killer's tastes, personality, etc.The multiple narrator touch seems to be a new thing in literature, especially the unreliable-female-narrator. It works for a larger extent, but of course, I can sense the struggle that the author might go through with trying not to reveal too many spoilers.Recommended for its good premise and pace. Made some difficult reading for me as some of the issues mentioned drove home."
"Except with Hitchcock I haven't read a compelling book that gives the reader a separate scene that allows complete third person omniscient perspective. On this train Rachel rides daily into London to a job she lost months ago. Her perspective out of the train window and when the train stops she can peek into the homes and lives of two separate families. On the train back to her flat, she often begins drinking canned gin and tonics that eventually lead to her alcoholic black outs. She is obsessive about her lost life with her ex-husband, her infertility and a mystical couple who live a few doors down from her previous home.Not only does Rachel observe the back terraces, but she notices clothes and oddities that are discarded by the train tracks below her.As the story unfolds, Hawkins develops each character into deeper, darker aspects of what we first know. Rachel is written to be dark from the beginning, however what the reader doesn't expect is the other characters are equally complex and dark.I highly recommend this book. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the editing, e.g., misspelled words, incorrect word choice (then versus than). That flaw was distracting, but not so much as I didn't finish the book."
"Warning: This is not a happy book. It takes place in a suburb of London and is full of broken people living broken lives. However, how these broken people are revealed and how they all relate to a murder is what makes the book interesting. The mystery is told from three different women’s points of view, each telling their story in the first person. It can get little confusing, especially when they jumble time periods, but you slowly learn the whole story by listening to each one. I was intrigued in the first third, bored somewhat by Rachel’s interminable alcohol black-outs in the middle, but then was gripped through the final third as the full truth began to be revealed. It has almost no action (until the end) and is mostly a lot of sad people talking about their sad lives, but the way the author broke up this murder mystery made it interesting. Kind of how I feel about the romance in the movie “500 Days of Summer” where the story is pretty simple but the reveal is the fascinating part. So I enjoyed it, but don’t read it if you need a lift of your spirits! 3-1/2 stars out of 5."
"This book was ok. The blackouts of the main character seem a stretch, especially toward the end of the book. While I like the premise of the story unfolding through different character voices, the development of each character is shallow. You know each of the characters has demeaning, undesirable qualities, but they are just blah and predictable. The only nice character, Cathy, comes across as a doormat.As the book progresses, it becomes very predictable, which is disappointing. Without divulging too much information about specific characters, I felt at loose ends wondering what happened with some of the remaining characters. The ending was somewhat abrupt, almost as if the author had reached her quoto of pages and decided to call it quits before tying up the loose ends.I did see some style, plot, and character similarities  between this author and Gillian Flynn, however, Flynn's writing is more developed. I wouldnt say the book was a total wash, but I fail to understand the rave reviews."
"I read the reviews on this book. People comparing it to Gone Girl and such. Well I thought the book was pretty good, but it was no Gone Girl.The main character is hard to like. She exudes self pity and naïveté to a degree that sometimes makes you roll your eyes. I get it. Things are hard and she is confused. We've all probably felt that way. It's just ... Well I wasn't against her but I wasn't exactly cheering for her either.There is a neat little twist near the end of this book that did surprise me and ultimately I was satisfied at the ending.This book is good beach reading. I wouldn't call it riveting and it is easy to feel depressed as the story unfolds and you get caught up in the messes of these peoples' lives. But it's interesting enough to slog through to the end. I was glad to be done with it though."
"I originally wrote a very short review complaining that the author lifted the idea of her book from Agatha Crhistie.I'm editing this now because I think readers need to know some specific negatives about this, especially in the Kindle edition.About the novel: This is sort of a psychological mystery. It provides great suspense until midway, then it falls flat.  We think we have a complex, scary kind of lady on this train and that she is up to no good. In fact, the plot of the story is way less interesting and the mysterious crackpot isn't.I don't know why Hawkins uses triple narration. It does not move the story forward, in fact, the story doesn't know what direction it's going with this style narration. I kept saying, okay, when is this taking place, and thinking I have a chronology when I don't.Reading this in Kindle is excruciating. In a book, I'd be flipping pages backwards to check on who said what, when, and in regard to whom. With Kindle, you can only Go To a location or a page and Lord knows how you figure that out from the Table of Contents.If you think you'd like to read this, for godssakes don't buy it for Kindle."
Was I the only person who thought this book was terrible? Aside from being completely implausible (but not ridiculous enough to be entertaining or diabolical enough to be disturbing) the protagonist was annoying. I hate to describe a character so teenager like but there really isn't much of a redemption in her character or a better way to say it. She's self aware enough and self loathing enough that I couldn't relate or empathize. I struggled to finish this book.
"Yes, it is similar to Gone Girl, but Gone Girl is much better.The Girl on a Train starts amazingly and is seductive at the beginning, but at the third of it, starts losing its power. The story is narrated by three women and you cannot distinguish their voices. All of them describe, tell and narrate exactly in the same way, so it's like they don't have a personality of their own. At some point the descriptions are a little boring, and the action is missing.In summary, it starts great, then it falls, but the ending is fine. It actually makes a clear feminist statement. The topics that you can analyze from the book are many and they are relevant, the idea is ver good, but something is missing."
"This author certainly knows how to weave a sad tale of loneliness, sadness and how one person's selfish, evil acts can affect the lives of so many others. This book is definetly a page turner. After a certain point I knew who the killer was, but did not expect the person who steps up in the end to do so. The story line does keep your interest, but I had to put it down every few chapters and take a break from the main character's sadness. To me that speaks of the author's ability to absorb you into her words. I gave this book 4 stars because, even though it is well written and certainly worth reading, I do not have any interest in reading it again, I only rate books I would re-read 5 stars."
"I liked the book.  Held my interest all the way through, but I found the ending to be a bit disappointing, and somewhat contrived."
A LITTLE CONFUSING AT TIMES.
Engaging with enough twists to make you wonder. Slow start but amount of moving pieces pulls you in. Good summer read.
A little boring and frustrating in parts
"Original, inventive, puzzling book that explores the thought processes around a suburban woman's bleak life."
"I know The Girl on the Train has gotten rave reviews, but when you get right down to it, it's a boring read.  I would not recommend it."
Hard to stop reading!
I thought it was good but it took me a while to get through because I kept getting confused.
not as good as I thought. Kept waiting for something to happen. Ending was typical mystery ending.
Omniscient voice would have been much easier to follow. And I jut couldn't make myself care about Rachel until the lat two chapters.
"This is an exciting read.  I like the way the chapters are divided up by the characters of the narrative, all of them women.  And, the women are not entirely likable.  I found myself unsympathetic at times, but drawn to their flaws, dramas, and insecurities.  It was a view of modern women but not the most modern of sensibilities--a pseudo-'60's millennial feel for one of the characters.  I don't want to give anything away, but one habit I had was to constantly check the dates of the narrative, whomever the author was focusing on--it goes back and forth, and drives the narrative forward and makes it suspenseful, but a bit hard to keep track of. What I liked about the read is that I commute daily to work on a train--reading standing up in a crowded train, sitting down, even missed my stop a couple of times.  Definitely worth reading..."
"Poor alcoholic Rachel.  As she commutes daily on a train, heading towards a job she longer has, passing the same scenes daily, she creates a world of her own.  She fills it with characters that she assigns the perfect life, the perfect love.  Filling worthless, filled with longing for her ex husband and jealousy for his current wife and their new baby, she's witness to a murder.  Of course she's viewed with doubt.  After all she's an unreliable drunk who suffers blackouts and is obssessed with her ex husband's life. She sounds crazy and is viewed as such.  Twists and turns.  Some surprises.  I began to suspect who the murderer was half way through the book.  Still a good read that I kept going back to.  I felt real sorrow for Rachel.  Unable to move forward with her life, unable to admit that her past life is over, unable to decipher what memory is real and what is blurred by wine.  First time I have read htis aurthur.  I would read her again. Her characters are believable and I wanted to find out what happens to them"
"Wonderful idea, poorly executed towards the end. I really wanted to like this, but the last half of the book DRAGGED. Maybe one good reveal every 45 minutes (used the audio book). It also started to feel a little messy and disorganized with the jumping perspectives and timelines. 3 stars because while a solid half of the book was annoying, I enjoyed the tail end."
"As I started this book,I was sure that I reading the story from someone who had suffered a major head trauma and was trying to remember something that was important at a place she no longer lived at.  I didn't realize that there was 3 different women telling different but connecting tales. One was an alcoholic, another a stay at home mom whose husband she stole from his wife (the alcoholic), and emotional distressed wife, having an affair with the husband of the other two. One of these women winds up dead .The solving of her murder falls to the other two because of their connection.  My impression of Rachel,the girl on the train, leaves me hoping there is a better future for those who try"
"I tried so hard to like this story and stick it out, because I hate to give up on a book. Rachel, Anna, Jess/ Megan, Scott and whoever else ( ex hubby) were just so unlikeable. I couldn't identify with any of them because the protagonist was....well a train wreck from the beginning to end, and as far as I was concerned never got back on track. I understand being in love and having ones heart broken and everything else she was going through was awful, but it was really hard to identify with her on any level, because I didn't like her, and I tried. I didn't like her roommate either, who pops up a lot in the story. Towards the end when the truth came out it could've been exhilarating because I wasn't really expecting that, but personally I was just glad this train had pulled into the station and I could step off! Felt like all these characters should of been tied to the railway tracks,  Not much to say, it was a page turner, but only because I wanted to get to the end as fast as I could !"
"I think the most surprising portion of the book encompasses Rachel's past. The complex, and tragic way the characters connect was interesting and made me want to read more.I will say that I called the ending. There was a portion of Megan's narration that just made it click. Of course, the book then distracts you into other appealing ideas, but they never quite pan out.The characters can be a bit of an annoyance. Rachel can be frustrating since she readily makes things more difficult for herself, and Anna is just a terrible person. When she talks, the malice is tangible.Overall, I did like it. I mean, I read it in two days, and I'm still looking forward to the film."
"Rachel Watson is the miserable poster woman for a Borderline Personality-disordered alcoholic who is depressed, anxious and has no redeemable qualities as a human being.  The premise itself is interesting; the point of view of the voyeuristic train passenger who imagines the lives of those living along the tracks of her daily commute.  Rachel finds herself in the middle of a mystery she feels compelled to participate in as a main character.  Just when you think her obnoxious and unreliable participation will actually contribute to something positive and meaningful - you are reminded that she is so shallow and self-serving that nothing good will come from her interference.  The other characters are equally as shallow and self-serving.  Although the book is very well-written and certainly interesting in it's telling, I couldn't help but be distracted by the fact that everyone was unlikable.  Ultimately, I was disappointed in the fact that Rachel never became a better person and we never learned the source of her sociopathic behavior. There was no one to root for  (not even the police) and in the end I am baffled as to why everyone was as deranged as they were."
"Great novel to read by the pool, which is just what I did today. I caught the twist earlier than I was supposed to, but it didn't ruin the outcome for me. Being American, I liked the small differences in the language. Otherwise, the  story could have taken in Anyplace, Anywhere. The trains add an nice change of scenery. I'm rambling, but it's so hard to write a review like this without spoilers. Bottom line, I enjoyed this book and will recommend it to others!"
"The first half of The Girl on the Train was great. The characters were believable and their intersecting narratives helped to drive the novel forward. However, about half-way through the book, just about everything falls apart. The characters start engaging in activities that are contrived and clearly not believable.  (Is it even remotely believable that the main character would have sex with one of the other main characters?  (Note: I'm being intentionally cryptic to avoid spoilers)).  At that point, the narrative becomes strained and intentionally drawn out.  Finally, it is a well-known device of poorly written mysteries for the killer to ""tell all"" near the end of the novel.  The best mysteries lay out all of the pieces of evidence as they proceed and there's no need for the killer to engage in revelations at the end of the book because everything has already been laid out.  I raced through the last third of this book simply because I wanted to be finished and move on to something more rewarding."
"This is one of the best mysteries or novels I have read in a long time.  The story is about a woman, Rachel, who has been destoyed by the betrayal by her husband.  He left her for another woman and he and the new wife now have a baby.  This was a goal which Rachel dreamed of even spending thousands on experimental fertility procedures.  Her husband claims they couldn't spend anymore for that, but that it was all right to take expensive vacations..  After the divorce, Rachel drinks too much and loses her job.  However, she continues to ride the train into London making believe she is still employed.  Each day she passes her old neighborhood, an upscale subdivision where her ex-husband now lives in her house with his new wife and baby.  Down the street is another couple, a beautiful perfect couple, and Rachel begins to dream that this could have been her and her husband if only her dreams turned out.The author spins a story of intrigue and lies among married couples and the terrible tricks that are played.  She drops clues along the way, and the reader needs to be watchful and gather them up.  I recommend this very highly.  I believe this is a first novel, and I can't wait to read Ms. Hawkins next book."
"SPOILERS AHEAD.Better than expected! I didn't think the characters would be as well and fully developed as they were. My only issue was with the reveal of whodunnit at the end. I won't give it away entirely, but the person who actually committed the murder behaves completely opposite of how an actual person with their mental issues would behave. The author paints the person like a children's-story villain, not an actual human with the issues that would compel them to behave in the manner that they behave.Otherwise, everyone else acted and thought and behaved in a manner consistent with actual human psychology, and I was very impressed."
"While the novel is entertaining and one of those books you can read in a day, and though it keeps the reader in suspense some of the time, the prose is quite prosaic and the ending overly melodramatic (and in some sense a bit absurd-- as if written for a Hollywood blockbuster). Most of the characters are wholly unbelievable and superficial, and in some sense the gender stereotypes the book promotes has set us all back at least a few decades. Overall, the book was a quick read and it was, admittedly, gripping up until the last couple of chapters-- just as a bestseller produced for mass consumption should be. Beyond that, it cannot be defined as art or true literature, as intellectually pretentious that may sound."
"I'd looked at this title and read the blurb many times before I relented and bought the book.  I think I've been reading too much to know the difference between good writing and bad.  While the pride flowed well in this book it was often times confusing.  Jumping between dates, Megan, Rachel, and Anna, I often find myself flipping back pages to see if what I was reading happened before or after doomsday.  Then when I got about 75% done, the bad guy became blatantly obvious.  No real physiological twist there.  I guess this is a good book.  It spent too many weeks on the NYT bestseller list to not be, right?  And it's already been optioned for a movie.  Have readers in general just gotten easier to please?"
"This thriller sucked me in. I loved how slowly the author unraveled the layers for the reader but still left enough questions to keep the reader doubting and questioning their own conclusions. I also applaud her strong multifaceted characterizations of all the female characters. They are all flawed but also real and they lack any shallow pretense. There is a melancholy intensity to all of them without being trite amd I appreciated them and the writing and story more for it.Writing from different character perspectives is difficult to achieve successfully but Hawkins does a great job of it.Highly recommend this book if you enjoy the combination of sharp, smart writing and thrillers."
"This book really had me captured and sucked into the story. I would have read it straight through if I could have. The writer had me constantly trying to figure out who the ""bad guy"" was. I think that the writing was superb and the book kept me guessing.I highly recommend reading this book. It was full of suspense, drama, and a lot of twists and turns. Worth the money that I spent. The only downside is that the author gives your first person narrative of 3 women in the book and from time to time I had to keep flipping back to the beginning of the chapter because I'd forget the time line and who was narrating. The book has a lot of flash backs so it can get confusing at times. But over all I highly recommend this book!"
"I read this book mostly because I like to read books that are about to become a movie and feel like I've beaten the suspense of waiting for it to come out! anyways, I don't know what all the big fuss is about! I mean it's a good story and all, I didn't see that ending coming but I started to figure it out about 3/4 of the book. I got the audiobook version so the listen is always good! I get a good sense of the characters by who is doing the dialogue. I just felt like the story was being dragged on! I feel like it could've been shorter and we still could've gotten the same ending! I mean I get it! She's a terrible alcoholic but it just kept being dragged on and on! But again this is not my typical read, so for what it was worth it was ok. I think you'll be ok if you just want to wait for the movie though!"
"This was a nice, well rounded story with plenty to keep me reading. There wasn't too much going on and it was a pleasure to follow. Having said that, I didn't get what all of the hype is about with this book. It wasn't that powerful. The story itself was a great concept and told in 1st, 2nd and 3rd person. Rachel is a strong character and so is Megan and Anna.Rachel though, seems depressed and I think she's a little jealous of her ex's new situation. His new wife, a brand new baby. They moved into Rachel and Tom's old house and then he posts pictures on FB about how happy they are. Sad, but he isn't wrong for doing it. Everyone does it and though he and her didn't work out it isn't his fault that she is jealous or depressed.I had no idea beforehand how the end would come about and certainly don't want to spoil it here but it wasn't as strong in the suspense aspect as other rival novels in its genre and I couldn't wait to be done with it. I think this book tries really hard but it just can't get it done. It's not Gone Girl and it never will be. But It was still worth the read if you like books in this genre, though I expected more of a racy, suspenseful experience."
A very disappointing read I found myself telling the characters to get a life.  It took me a couple chapters before I realized that there were three different girls as their voices were so similar. They make the most stupid spur of the moment decisions that get them into really bad situations especially Rachel and Megan. Anna is a piece of work I didn't like her at all.  I really didn't like any of the characters in this book and I found it very depressing and had to make myself finish it.  A few other people I spoke to about the book said that they couldn't finish it and that if I did I should tell them what happened. I am curious to see how they have made this into a movie.
"Honestly, I just don't like you. Yeah, you.... Rachel, Anne and Megan!I don't like your guys, husbands, and boyfriends in this book, either! In fact, I don't like ANYONE in this book!Does the writer make attempts at creating sympathy for some of these characters? Yeah...sort of. But there is a general disgust for everyone that is hard to shake off. I must admit, in the first couple chapters there is a fascinating draw to the narrative that did keep me reading...and reading...making me nauseous sometimes, sick and disgusted by stupid choices of our narrator, and then I became bored in the middle.I wanted to finish it, but I was sick of reading it. I put it down (metaphorically, since it's a Kindle) read something else and came back to finish it.And the finish was good. SCARY GOOD and mostly satisfying. No spoilers, sweetie! Just if you are looking for a book where you root for character and want to CARE for a main character, well....this ain't your book, baby. Much like Gone Girl where the unreliable narrative and unlikeable characters drive the story, this one has me shaking my head and drinking Pellegrino water!"
"Reading The Girl on the Train is like peeling an onion. The deeper you get into the story, the closer you get to understanding the central characters.  The main character, Rachel, is struggling on many levels. Half the time I was frustrated with her and the other half I wondered how and when she would regain her memory of that night when Megan disappeared and the part she might have played.  One of the most important elements of the plot is time. I would recommend that readers remember the key date, July 13, to keep from getting lost because Hawkins skillfully moves the plot in concentric circles around that date.  This is a page-turner. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"This is an excellent psychological thriller about an alcoholic and her imaginations from riding a train daily.  She gets involved in making up stories about a couple who live on the train route as she longs for her ex-husband who lives on the same street.  As a recovering alcoholic, I found it a little difficult to live through her drunken sprees and blackouts but it all comes together in the end with the unexpected ending. Highly recommend it."
"I've had this book and in my library for a few months now. It was recommended but I just wasn't feeling it. A friend was starting to read it, so I thought I'd join her and we could talk about it. Well I started on a Monday and finished on Wednesday! It's one of those books that you have to pay attention to the details, the dates, the names, etc...  It was an easy read, kept me on my toes and suspense filled. Excited to see what they do with the movie."
"Turning ""Girl on a Train"" into a movie is a new high/low in redundancy because it reads like a movie script, anyway; a novel for readers who like a lot of TV.  The characters are believable because they're ordinary, and they're easily forgotten because they don't say or do anything remarkable, clever, or challenging.  The device of the train is not exactly new, but a good writer with a feel for mystery and compelling characters could run with its possibilities.  The protagonist, Rachel, is an alcoholic filled with self-pity.  She is currenly exhausting the patience of her last codependent friend.  Oh, it's no use trying to review a book this shallow.  If only it had some wit or even a point."
"This book really wowed me.  I found it simply by seeing it listed on Amazon.  I didn't read a review, just took a gamble.  I don't read a lot of thrillers, but want to read more after this one.  Don't compare this to Gone Girl - it's way better, and way difference.  I really wanted to binge read this one, I wish I could have.  The characters were richly drawn, although sad in some cases, and the story was engrossing.  The story revolves around a woman not remembering critical (and potentially dangerous) events because she was black-out drunk, which was really unique and interesting - you got the sense of frustration on the main character's part to try and put the pieces of the puzzle together.  Loved it.....highly recommended."
"First and foremost, the writing in this book is bad. By the end of the first page, I knew it wouldn't even come close to living up to the hype and Gone Girl comparisons. The writing does not grab you or keep your attention, so finishing the book felt more like a chose than something I was interested in doing.The characters and the plot are poorly developed. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. Several of the plotlines end up being completely pointless (ie they had nothing to do with the final ""twist"" or the fate of the main character).. I guess they are supposed to increase suspense but in my opinion reading the book was similar to the experience of watching someone bake a delicious cake and then throwing it away. I kept reading even though I was bored because I anticipated a shocking twist and interesting resolution (probably in large part because of all the Gone Girl comparisons), but the story never picks up steam or becomes interesting.Ultimately, I would advise against reading this.. if you're like me, you'll probably read it anyway because of all the hype, but it's really not worth your time."
"A disturbing feeling. That's how I describe reading the life of the girl on the train. Her interest in complete strangers, a young couple who live on the same street as her ex husband and his new wife, is voyeuristic and downright creepy. She goes so far as to name them and imagine their relationship. This beginning sets up a dysfunctional mix of two neighboring couples and the ever watchful girl on the train--the ex-wife who is alcoholic and rides the train every morning to pretend she is still working a job so her roommate won't kick her out. In between her binges she puzzles over missing segments of her life that she fidgets with until convinced she has the missing part to the murder of the neighbor wife. If you like a snoop into  the lives of unstable, violent, and bizarre behavior this is your novel. The talent of the author that intrigued me was withholding information and weaving snippets of supposed truth throughout. At least it made me read to the end. This is a read with no literary merit. And personally, I would rather not have had these people enter my life. I found it disturbing and unsettling."
"It isn't hard to put yourself in the position of the narrator. Every day you ride the same train on the same route with the same people into the same huge city where you're another anonymous cog in the wheel. Your sense of being invisible has become literal; you no longer care what passengers think of you as you open the gins and tonic (they're sold in cans in England) that will make the day go by in a pleasant fog. As far as you're concerned, you're a nobody. And each time the train passes your ex-husband's house, which used to be yours, you know that you're nobody. You see the new wife, the one he was seeing before he left you. And you notice that the daughter they had is getting bigger.So, you've trained yourself to look a few houses down. There's a woman sitting in her front garden. Some mornings she's reading; other times she's drinking a cup of tea. The man who comes out and joins her is not bad looking, and so, with nothing else to do you start to make up stories about the lives of the couple. After all, if you were still married, you'd be neighbors. And you decide that you'd be friends. Until. One morning. When everything changes."
"Very slow getting started.  With alternating narrators and dates that are important but sometimes jump back and forth, I wished I were reading a book instead of my Kindle.  I ended up taking notes to avoid significant confusion.  I took notes up to about 41%.  By then everything was pretty easy to follow, but the dates continued to be critically important.  Once I got to 49% I was deeply involved and it was intense and enjoyable and I finished in about 24 hours, during which I did other things as well.  It was somewhat like Gone Girl although I ended up liking this and I totally hated Gone Girl because I didn't care if either character lived or died, in fact I wish she had died at the end.  These characters, while flawed people were at least sympathetic."
"I have mixed feelings about this novel. Like Gone Girl, it is a dark, surprising tale, and like Gone Girl, this novel features unreliable narration. Beyond that, I'm not so sure why there are so many comparisons between the two novels. I enjoyed the multiple points of view, and I appreciated that the characters were drawn with such unapologetic realism and complexity. That being said, there wasn't one likeable character in the entire novel, and while reading it, I desperately wished for just one positive nuance in any one of the characters. I also found that because this book was told out of chronological order, the various dates became difficult to keep up with. I was utterly delighted by the ending. I never once guessed what was actually going to happen, and in a novel of this level of dark suspense, that is a tremendous achievement. If you enjoy unreliable narration or a good, dark psychological thriller like Gone Girl or Mudvein, then I definitely think this book is worth the read. I will be very interested to see what Ms. Hawkins writes next."
"...and I cannot say anymore without completely spoiling it. In the beginning, it looked like a mystery built exclusively around the weakness of two of the main characters (one alcoholic with blackouts, one manic pixie dream girl wannabe unreliable narrator), but the slow burn ending and the perspective of the very sensible, cold and practical third protagonist brings on the reread element, just for kicks and foreshadowing.Only four stars because all of the characters (except Cathy, who is a cinnamon roll too good for this world) rely heavily on the reproduction / maternity angle for background issues and motivation, and I personally find it a bit of a cliché. It is still a great read!"
"While I typically don't take the time to write reviews of novels, since I feel a good review should include more thoughtful analysis than, ""this was a good book"" or ""I recommend it"", I feel the need to review this book. While I was inspired to purchase this book due to the abundance of positive reviews, I was quite disappointed. The story was flat, uninspiring. I heard that it will be turned into a motion picture, which makes me question, how many of the scenes will be of a disheveled alcoholic sitting on a train (doesn't sound too exciting of a movie)?The book was a quick read, I finished it over the course of weekend. You won't walk away with a profound understanding of alcoholics or anything of that nature. I say skip the book and just wait for the movie to come out, that way you'll waste less of your time."
I found the lead character was an alcoholic stalker who needed serious help. She should have been reported for stalking a long time ago. That said life is full of people like her and the other weird abusers unfortunately.The book was nothing like I expected and I  did appreciate the style it was written in. Some of it was predictable with character personalities to who did it. I guess my rating is due to expecting more from all of the hype it got.
"One of the best books I've read in a really long time. I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie, and I'm glad I did. They were both fantastic, but I think reading the book first gave me a better interpretation of the movie. Though the plot was twisted and dark, the characters were incredibly engrossing. As more and more information came to light, the plot just became more and more enticing. It is a little easy to see the ending coming from about halfway through, but there are enough other things going on that it doesn't take away from the read. It's just unbelievable to me that this is a debut novel because it's such an amazing read."
"Really, really good...better than I expected really, and with a lot of psychological complexity that doesn't fully come clear until the payoff at the end. Honestly found parts of it difficult to read. I normally really struggle with books about addiction or with addicts as main characters...much less narrators...so it's really a tribute to the writing that I found it impossible to put down, in spite of that.While I suspected/guessed aspects of that ending, that psychological complexity I mentioned still made the payoff really worthwhile. I found myself thinking about layers of that days later, in terms of the dimensionality of the characters themselves. I don't want to say too much due to the spoiler thing, but anyone who knows anything about trauma and how it affects people will probably pick up on a lot of this, especially in relation to the Rachel character and her spiral following her divorce.A great mystery story...and a great psychological thriller. I'll definitely be looking out for more by this author!"
"I wanted to love this book, but I was disappointed. The characters are shallow and boring. The ""girl""  and other  female characters are weak and present as victims. They have been mistreated, but fall into the don't help yourself mode of dealing with their circumstances. That's not me. The structure of the book felt contrived- as in I don't have an interesting tale so I'll add a confusing format. The telling was tedious and only got interesting near the end and then there was some additional prose that seemed to have no purpose as an ending. I'm sure it will be an entertaining movie w the right actors, but the book was a flop for me."
"I really wanted to give this book 5 stars, but the only thing holding me back was that I thought that the ending wasn't as detailed as the rest of the book and felt a little rushed. However, it didn't detract from the story and the story was fabulous in every way!  It took me about 3 or 4 chapters to get my head around who the main character was. It would have been helpful to have a little notebook handy and write down which character and date I was reading as the chapters jump back and forth a bit just as they did in Gone Girl and initially I found it difficult to follow but it is well worth persevering. Rachel, the main character is fascinating to follow as she embeds herself in the lives of others and tackles her own issues at the same time. I started to determine the answers to the mystery about halfway through and was pretty sure about it at about the three quarter mark. I would have liked the story to have given a bit more detail around the character of Megan as it would have been nice to see what made her tick also. Overall, a great and entertaining story. I would recommend reading if you like a psychological drama/thriller."
"I have not been able to get completely absorbed by a crime novel in a long time. If you add the fact that I tend to be a contrarian reader, i.e. I tend NOT to read what everyone raves about, I was incredibly surprised by how much I enjoyed this little masterpiece.Story is all told in the first person by the three main female characters, which keeps the pace fast enough to keep you turning pages but also gives you pause to think and absorb. You will probably figure out the culprit as you start delving into the thick of the book, but it doesn't really matter: Anna, Rachel and Megan will make you grimace, smile, cringe and always find a way to reach inside of you. That's the most stunning feature of this book: I read many novels that made me connect with THE main character, but I have seldom found myself in the shoes of all the key characters.My final piece of advice: pick it up before you go on vacation, or off for long relaxing weekend, maybe if you have long train commutes (ahem) ahead of you. I promise you'll be so captured you'll struggle to put you Kindle down."
"Now I see why The Girl On The Train is this year's Gone Girl.  Rachel rides the train daily to London, watching one particular couple as she passes their house.  She playfully names them Jess and Jason and creates their own perfect fantasy marriage.  But one day, the lady of the house is nowhere to be seen.  Rachel suspects foul play.  She confronts the police and nearby neighbors.  There's one huge catch: Rachel has a drinking problem.  She's an unreliable witness, and has an ugly past with the neighborhood.  If she keeps prying, Rachel could become the next headline.  Written from the perspective of Rachel, Anna and Megan, Hawkins displays her Train ladies as journal entries, taken in morning and evening segments.  Will anyone ever believe Rachel, especially the fateful night she can't quite remember?  Is Anna really the sweet, caring, overprotective mom?  And what about Megan, the missing artist with the twisted past?  Hitchcock in its styling, with enough red herrings to open an aquarium, and a tarnished heroine the reader can root for, The Girl On The Train is well worth the ticket. I can't wait for the movie!"
"On the cover of this book SJ Watson calls it 'Gripping, enthralling - a top-notch thriller and a compulsive read'. I agree 100%I simply could not put this book down.It is well written - tight, tense and thrilling all the way. Reading it is like riding a roller coaster.Who is telling the truth?Who is lying?Rachel, an emotionally unstable alcoholic who has recently lost her marriage and her job, rides the train to London every day, keeping up the pretence she still has a job.Everyday she passes the back of the street where she used to live - when she was married - and every day she looks.She makes up stories about the people in the houses - one couple in particular.Then one day she sees something; something that changes the way she sees these people and that will involve her in their lives.A compulsively readable, emotionally immersive, Hitchcockian thriller; this is an electrifying debut embraced by readers across markets and categories.I have read some really good books this year, but this is far and away the best."
"The premise of the story about watching people and their lives while on a train appealed to me. I can imagine making up stories about the people you would see every day.  However, I found I was not looking forward to reading it. The author kept going back and forth with dates and flashbacks and I found myself backtracking to see what date we were on. The story developed too slowly and the characters were just not all that interesting. I put the book down after reading more than half of it. I was just not enjoying it. I will not read another book by this author."
"It was a good read because I never read another story like this but, the characters were awful. Not one person, except the room-mate, had any good character traits so I found the story went nowhere. I found myself not caring about what happened to any one of these deplorable people. I also found the ending anticlimactic because it didn't matter who did what- the story could have gone in almost any direction without any surprise ending."
"The story is ok in a twisty / turning kind of way.  Since the reader jumps between 3 characters POV, we sometimes see the same event multiple times, from different perspectives.  I didn't have a problem with the story, which is a very convoluted "" who dunnit,"" with an incredibly dull and predictable ending.  Rather I found the characters flat and underdeveloped.  There are three voices, and they all sound exactly the same.  But for Ms. Hawkins telling you what character is narrating, you'd never know which woman is which.  The three narrators are given slightly unique traits: one's a drinker, the other has a baby and the last one is missing.  The audio book was superior because three women narrated so they had actual unique voices, which helped differentiate the otherwise similar characters.I wouldn't recommend the book, but if you need something to while away a short plane ride, it isn't terrible."
"Here's the deal. There is no doubt that the author is an amazing at describing places, people. and things, as well as developing inner thoughts. However, like the title, it began slowly as if the train is starting to move, and then the rhythm begins which is a good thing. What weighed me down was that there was not one strong character that took the lead. I could not connect to whiney women, and men I knew little about. The good news is that if you're a woman, you'll identify with the ""I'm every woman"" concept that carries through the novel. Nothing is new under the sun here, except finding ""whodunnit."" The novel could another editing go around as there are missing words that slow the read.  If you're a Hawkins fan, you know that there will be a whole bunch of reality mixed in with some mystery."
"Although the style of writing from each character's point of view is something we have all seen before, this novel really allows this method to develop the characters.  The reader gets to see, from all angles, what is happening.  The plot keeps you guessing:  I must have changed my mind seven times in trying to figure out who was responsible.  You definitely can elate to our main character's perspective when on the train, in particular if you ever were or are currently a commuter.  You get involved with her thoughts and you realize that you may have done the same type of fantasizing in your travels.  A few twist, but not so many that you get lost.  A good, fast read."
"Very well written and easy to follow in spite of the fact that it was told in first person by each of three different women from each of their perspectives.  The chapter would be titled with the first name of whichever woman was talking and it would go back and forth. Even though this sounds confusing, it was not.  None of the characters were particularly lovable, just flawed in their own ways.  It was very suspenseful and moved the reader along well.  Except for being the tiniest bit drawn out, it was very hard to put down.  I didn't figure out the ending before the point at which they wanted me to know the ending, and that's always good.  Would recommend it to fans of suspenseful novels and murder mysteries.  If you liked Gone Girl, you will like this as well."
"The main characters are all women.  The problem is that they are all so sick.  I could not ""root"" for any one of them.  I always need a character that I like and am on there side.  But no, not is this case The writing as a skill did not particularly create any differences between in any of the three women.  They were all one dimensional.  I know who the killer is and the killer is of course-sick.  Oh well,  it will help me like the next book on the night stand"
"I read reviews about how good a book this was; otherwise, I would never have bought it.  The reviews, however, are hyped, overstated in terms of the ""suspense"" and ""leaving you guessing at every moment.""  That is why I gave this book 4 stars, along with the complexity of the novel.  I read the entire thing in two sittings over 8 hours last Friday, but I had to keep reading to keep all the stuff straight--who was doing what, etc.  I almost had to draw a picture to keep track of what was going on.  The book is told from the perspectives of three women:  Rachel, Megan, and Anna.  So you always had to keep in mind what perspective you were reading.  Then whoever was telling the story, was dated and timed, like August  5, 2013, early morning, mid morning, evening, etc.  And then the next section might be July 5, 2013, so you had to think, ""Oh, yeah, this is one month before the last section, but now it is from a different woman's perspective.""  See how confusing this gets?"
"The novel is perfectly paced, even though I know some who said it was really slow in the beginning. I, personally, prefer when the author takes us into the minds of his/her characters, showing us who they are, what they want, what they dream about. I like a slow burn. I don’t need to jump into the action on page three. But it is just me.The main female characters are drawn beautifully. One is an obsessed wreck of a woman. Another is a manic, complicated and a very unhappy girl. Finally, the third woman is a mistress who becomes the second wife, and who gleefully gloats about it. What’s not to love about this assemble of women?The story is twisted. The plot is tight. The main narrator is unreliable because most of the time she is drunk and cannot remember anything. Important details are presented to us methodically. Our fist impressions of each character are slowly warped by each unexpected and twisty revelation. You will question everything and everyone.In the end, however, you will be greatly satisfied. The ending is immaculate."
"It's hard to give a book 3 stars when it really kept me tied to my Kindle. But there's a strange dichotomy here. It's a rather dark thriller which kept me guessing until about page 170, where I sort of guessed how things meshed together. But I did not like the characters. Apart from aspects of Scott, I could not feel the empathy a reader should have with at least one or two characters. Rachel, the alcoholic, is one of those women who seem to moan and whine and irritate people. She irritated me, and her frequent and total blackouts after binge drinking were not always convincing. Anna is such a typical weak and clingy type -- but at the very end she's suddenly this amazingly strong woman just when the reader expects her to fall apart. Megan's psychiatrist remains a very vague figure, as does Megan herself. In fact, Megan is the least convincing character.But hey, there's a murder ...nuff said, I don't want to spoil the book for you. The atmosphere right through is somewhat depressing and humour is completely absent. But I guarantee you -- the book will still keep you reading until the very last page."
"The writer has infused life into the most wretched of characters. The ugliness, the mediocrity of everyday lives becomes interesting. There is no glamour, no great beauty, no riches, no great philosophy revealed, or perfect and passionate love obtained. The author reveals that humanity in its rawest form, at its humblest moments has a story worth telling. In our every day lives the stories are not revealed, even when we play a part in them, we don't always  understand the story or our roles within it.  The author helps us to step back and view the lives of these characters, understanding their stories and leaving us with the desire to examine our own stories and the characters in them a little more closely. This book is a good read. Like a train trip, it is a pleasant and strangely comforting ride. The epiphany is not actually arriving at the destination but is broken up into tiny bits, distributed in observations and insights discovered during the ride."
I haven't re it yet but my wife loved it and couldn't put it down.
Not my style.
I really enjoyed it
"awfully coincidental, but page turner"
Really enjoyed the book.
Very good book!
Just ok.
"Love, love this book."
I love it.
Would not get my nose out of
Good plight
Pretty much fantastic.
Could not get into it.
"The plot, such as it was, was rife with holes and inconsistencies. There wasn't a single likable or reliable to be found. The women were all victims-of themselves, of men, of each other. The men were all abusive and two out if three were openly misogynist. I was astonished to find the author was a woman - as the woman-hating tone started early and ran so deep. I suppose you could write it off to artistic license if the book were otherwise engaging, entertaining or thought-provoking - but it's not."
A good read.  I enjoyed it.
too redundant
"I absolutely hated this book.  It was a nightmare of self-analysis, insecurity, drunken blackouts, and soap opera drama.Ugh!  Save your money."
"My first time ever reading anything by this author I found the book to be very entertaining.I was a little confused in the beginning with the characters,but I kept reading and just enjoyed the book all the way to the end. The ending was a shocker didn't see that one coming. This book is a definitely must read put on your list..."
Great story..loved the characters.
A must read!
a thriller indeed!
Very suspenseful - with a twist!
Page turner!!
"This book is so good, the most interesting, most shocking, best book I've read in years! The story will grab you and won't let go!! Read it!!!!"
Great read!
"Creepy, but really good!"
A tad hard to follow but great read!
Very exciting
"Fast read, particularly at the beginning ."
It was thrilling!
"This book is often compared to Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl, which was a much better book IMO. As I read this book I was often able to predict what would happen next, and the author's attempts to create suspense<U+200B> sometimes fell flat."
"The best thing about the book was that it did become very interesting in the last three chapters.  The most difficult part of the book was keeping the timeline and the characters straight. As a result, I had a difficult time finishing the book. Nevertheless, I try to finish a book club book so I can reasonably participate in the discussion. All of the characters are desperately flawed. It seems so unlikely to have so many dysfunctional people in one plot. If one is willing to suspend that disbelief, the outcome is, perhaps, less surprising. Therefore, I found it to be tedious even to the end. I am still surprised that the detectives, who had been so suspicious of everyone, were so willing to let the culprits go with only one standing up for the other. There was no reason for them to let them go without further investigation. Perhaps the story would take on a completely different aspect if told from the point of view from the detectives. As an English teacher, I would love to hear my students reconstruct the plot from the various points of view!  Fascinating idea!"
"An extremely well written book that I have found myself recommending to countless others. It is a real page turner that kept me guessing to the end. I thought it a really unusual and novel presentation of a psychological thriller; knowing the Victorian houses that line the railway tracks into London, I often found myself wondering about the people who lived behind their doors and windows . Writing the three main characters in the first person was an excellent idea allowing a more intimate knowledge of these women and none more so than the girl on the train herself. An unbelievably good, more than good, first novel, Paula Hawkins has a lot to live up to!"
"I put off buying this book because my husband always whines if I buy books written by women since he reads everything I buy and usually hates the 'female' point of view--.but this time--I read the book in an afternoon and evening and he decided to give it a try.  I thought maybe he'd hate it--it's first person ""female""...but he loved it--I totally lost him for the evening as he was engrossed from page one.The story is a sad one in many ways--especially if you or anyone close to you has an issue with addiction.  Simply reading the book can put you off alcohol for awhile.  The characters ring true--you ache for the main character and feel her confusion and fear.  I usually can figure out the 'who done it' by the time I'm a third of the way through most any mystery, but this one kept me guessing and even when I guessed right I didn't want to believe it.Fast paced--the kind of book you fall into and don't want to put down.  And--for all the men who fear women writers for their sentimentality--this is the perfect read."
"Like so many others have written in these reviews, I kept waiting for something momentous to happen.  Nothing.  It's just the stupidest story I can imagine. No wonder Hollywood has optioned it!  If you like reading about depressing alcoholics, stalkers, and ridiculous side characters, then this book is for you. No thank you. Yuck."
"I have about 75 more pages until I'm finished with this book. Yes, it's been dragging along for me and there are a few reasons:  1. The main characters lack real depth. I want to empathize or ""side"" with at least one of the characters but being unformed, they come across as one-dimensional and simply self-absorbed; 2. The book lacks suspense. The pace of the book is erratic because the author jumps back and forth in time for all of the main characters. These ""interruptions"" stall any suspense that should be building and growing and; 3. Like a STEREOTYPICAL day in London, the tone of the of the book is grey and gloomy which equated to dull for me.  I really wanted to like this book like the majority of reviewers and be able to tell friends and relatives, "" You really need to read this book!""  Not the case here.......but that's just my opinion."
"This is an engaging story of human frailties and trials. It is told in the first person, by different characters, which gives an extra layer of interest. There are no really ""good"" characters, but there is one very definitely ""bad"" one, and that identity remains a secret until almost the end. I read this book as part of a book club, and, as one of my fellow members put it, ""I didn't like any of the characters, but I loved thebook."" Couldn't agree more!"
"I like to read the really negative reviews, to see why someone hated a book I truly enjoyed.  The most consistent complaint is that none of the three main women characters were likeable, in fact, pretty much unlikeable.  I agree.  But so what.  You always have to have some likeable character?  Life is not like that.  If you need always someone likeable, stick to books written for teens.  Some had trouble following the plot.  It is not tricky at all, in fact, Ms. Hawkins is pretty ingenious in the way she plots this book.  A lot of books move backwards and forwards in time for seemingly no reason other than to be literary; this book has excellent reasons and it works.  Finally some claimed they figured out the (SPOILER ALERT) killer before coming close to being finished.  Baloney.  This is well-written, well-plotted, different and well done.  Sure if you think back on it some of it seems preposterous, but, there are very few mysteries in which that does not happen.  Congratulations Mr. Hawkins.  Well done.  Don't let the critical ducks nibble you to death."
"The storyline does a reasonable job of exploring the personalities of the characters, particularly the images in the imagination of ""The Girl On The Train"" in and of herself as she sees images from something of a distance, and frames illusions about what they mean. From my perspective this presents a tale of a person who really doesn't seem to know herself very well, replaces ""knowledge"" with suppositions, as well as other characters in the play, and as events unfold they grope through and eventually learn more about their foundations of themselves and among each other.Yes, there is some mystery that unfolds in a very slow way, and my guess is that we as readers actually know some people that have issues as told in the story that the characters will remind us of knowing. It is possible that some readers will ""see"" themselves in the tale. For those, that I'd guess would be in the minority, the work might trigger some inspiration although in and of itself I would not call this work inspirational nor would it qualify as dynamic: revealing; yes."
I didn't enjoy the start of this book and nearly put it down but because I didn't have anything else to read at the time I persevered and am glad I did. Whilst the whodunit side was fairly obvious by the third quarter of the book I was compelled to finish as I had finally found some empathy for the main character. I'm not sure I would bother reading one of her novels again but am not disappointed that I read this. The main issue for me was the dislikable main character who wasn't quite complex enough to be interesting either
Very thought provocative.
Great summer read!
I would recommend this book to people who like mysteriesMy husband is also reading the book  I love the detail that the novel goes into I enjoy reading  because books transform me to other places and help to inspire my imagination
Great
Boring
"I enjoyed it very much,"
Somewhat plodding though. Character development good. Enjoyed the British location. Should make a good basis for a movie. Going to remember the cork screw as weapon.
"So I needed to stop reading...when I clearly was so engrossed in these pages.  Loved the book, I don't read to try and figure out what's going to happen, in this case total shocker, I read to enjoy each page. Now I can watch the movie with clear expectations.  I recommend for a quick read"
"I can't believe people actually like this!  This is boring, predictable, and just plain stupid.  There are basically a handful of events that just repeat itself until the writer decides it's enough.  The characters are boring and not likable.  The plot is repetitive.  They are all one dimensional.  I had 5th grade students who write like this.  There is no suspense."
"Better than the movie and takes place in London.  make sure you pay attention to which character is ""speaking"" in each chapter or you'll get confused."
"Took me a while to adapt to the writer's style, but the story kept me going and I soon got accustomed to the very ""British"" style (and the somewhat anaccronistic setting as the story developed). No wonder it was adapted into a blockbuster motion picture!!"
"Not my usual genre (I am a historical fiction, nonfiction, period piece kind of gal) and I normally shy away from best sellers. Read only because a coworker said it was better than ""Gone Girl"" (which I did not care for at all) and my mom kept asking if I knew what all the hubbub was about this book. A few pages into it I was totally hooked and couldn't put it down (laundry didn't get done and the b.f barely got supper). I HAD to find out whodunit. A little predictable (I figured it out about halfway through) but still an engaging read through to the end. Definitely had a Hitchcock vibe and would make a great movie! My mom, also an avid reader, was a little more lukewarm about it. She thought it was okay, but definitely not her style (she is a romance/historical fiction/Nora Roberts fan). We both were entertained and decided in the end it was money well spent (but then when is money spent on a book not well spent)."
"Okay, let me first admit that I am not a fan of 'psychological' novels, and had I known this was one, I wouldn't have bought it.  Nor am I happy with authors who use something like psychology and/or addiction to get the character to do something totally brain-dead.  This author used both.  This is one of those stories that would be an essay if the heroine just used some common sense (just a teeny bit of common sense!) in the first chapter.  In addition, I didn't like a single character in the book and was severely tempted to stop reading it, but I knew I wanted to write a review, so I must read the whole thing.  The character closest to likable was Cathy, who was super-nice and a major enabler of Rachel's psychological and addiction problems--basically a doormat and doing all the wrong things."
"A caution I neglected to heed was all of the comments comparing this book to Gone Girl, another book I really did not like. Instead I looked at all of the reviews raving about the book and plunked my money down. Unless you enjoy muddled mysteries with unlikeable people and can totally suspend logic, steer clear!"
"Great book! Fast read, brilliantly written. The suspense was awesome. Never knowing until the end who the actual killer was.  Rachel on the verge of the end but hanging in there trying her best to pull it together in order to help those characters who had become her only life after her divorce. And Cathy for not giving up on Rachel, not approving but never really letting her go. The ties that binds real friends and caring people. In a time when it's easier to look the other way. Once again overall it was an awesome book. Will definitely recommend to all my friends and family. Thank you Paula for writing this book."
The plot is thin and all problems are solved when the main character's blackout memory gap suddenly resolves itself . . . despite the author's repeated warnings throughout the book that this is not how blackouts work. But it doesn't matter. By the end you don't care who dies or who survives because the characters are so ridiculously unlikable. Spoiler alert: Don't bother pushing through to the end under the assumption that it has to get better. It does not.
This is from one who has read some and drunk some more and I would say the main focus in this book is on the alcohol addiction and how that befuddles you and less on the actual crime. Good  insight in the alcohol department and other potential addictions.  I would have loved to see how Rachel would manage to get sober with good support  and get her life back and then solve the crime in question.
"I read this book in ONE weekend...and I have a toddler.  It is the definition of a page turner.  It is told from 3 sets of views.  Rachel is the main character.  She is a young woman living a life of lies.  Her alcoholism cost her marriage, job and dream life.  To keep up appearances, she rides the train to the job she no longer holds.  She takes this opportunity to watch the house her ex husband and new wife live in.  She also becomes obsessed with the neighbors, Jess, a few houses down.  She make believes a life for them and creates a story surrounding the beautiful woman and her husband.  Her obsessive nature leads to several run ins with her ex husband and his new wife and former mistress, Anna.  After an alcohol filled night she discovers Jess is missing and she has no  recollection of the night.  All she knows is that she was on that street and had an altercation with Anna.  It is a gripping page turner and about the time you think you have it figured out... guess again!"
"I wonder if I was the only person who hoped that Rachel would also at some point, be murdered. She was almost unbearably pathetic and unfortunately without any other strong, likable characters I just found myself whipping through the book so I didn't have to be reading it anymore."
"I downloaded a sample of this book on my Kindle.  When I finished the sample I chose not to purchase it at that time and maybe read it later. What I had read in the sample was slow, depressing and just not of much interest to me.  After having several people tell me they liked it, I purchased it.  I'm glad I read the  entire book, but it took over 1/2 way through for me to look forward to picking it up and reading it.  The girl is an alcoholic, which is depressing enough, but she rides this train everyday and noses into other peoples lives who live in houses along the train tracks by watching them as she rides by.  Although all of those things she witnessed during her train rides tie into the story later on in the book, it was depressing and boring to me at first.  At the point where I started to see how it all tied together, the book got quite interesting and I'm glad I stayed with it.  Had me guessing to the end about what really took place.  Glad my friends pushed me to read the book.  It was worth it."
"I found it difficult to get into the book.  After reading the first fifty pages, I had a hard time picking it back up to read.I was on an airplane with time to kill which is why I finished the book.The first half of the book rambled and was hard to relate to the characters.  The last third of the book was more interesting,but I'm not sure if it was worth the pain and boredom to get there.  The story line dragged on and on.  But, her characterdevelopment was pretty good.  Towards the end of the book, I began to gain more understanding/sympathy of Rebecca,Megan, Tom, and other characters.  The author's writing style was average to me in comparison to, what I think, are better writers,e.g., Patrick Smith, Nelson DeMille, Pat Conroy, et. al.Bottom line, maybe the book is a better read for those more sensitive and emotional than me."
"The first few pages pulled me in; the way the characters or at least the central female characters each got a turn to ""talk"".  I connected with them even if I would not want to be their friend.  The personality of many of these characters frustrated me to no end as one is an alcoholic - and all are self-involved - but then I would imagine the portrayal of the alcoholic was true-to-life.  I know it is with the self-involved individuals.It was interesting to see how deeply you can be involved in someone’s life without actually knowing that person.  It speaks to our voyeur society and the interconnection of events through our life.The end was not predictable although someone might argue that it was wrapped up a bit too smoothly.  I still had questions at the end – so everything was not answered to my satisfaction.Regardless, it was never boring and the pace is fast.  I would like to have another book this minute that would entertain me as this one did."
"I came close to dumping this book after about 4 chapters...it is a slow-burn.  I really disliked where I thought it was going. But, since it was on the Best Seller List, I thought there just had to be more to it. I was so pleasantly surprised at how this book developed.  It was really, really good!  I hope this author can write more books that are this full of surprises!"
"The girl on the train is Rachel.  When the train stops at the signals, Rachel follows the movements of the couple who live at 11 Blenheim Road.  In her imagination they are Jess and Jason. In fact they are Scott and Megan.  A few doors down that road live Tom, Rachel's ex-husband, and his new wife, Anna. Rachel imagines a blissfully in love couple and is shocked when she sees another man in the back yard with Megan in an intimate embrace. Then there is the news that Megan is missing.  Rachel feels compels to assist the police.  And so the complex investigation begins.  However, underlying the whole story is Rachel's alcoholism and her propensity to invent things (tell lies).  The narration is shared between Rachel, Megan and Anna.  Rachel tries to fight her alcoholism and this has a poignant insight into the struggle of an addict to try to kick the habit – with always an excuse to procrastinate – “I'll start tomorrow”.  It always bothers me when the author chooses to tell the murder in the victim's voice.  The underlying theme of the book, one could say, is “truth or lies”."
"As much as the book was interesting, I have to say I just really didn't like it."
"Interesting book that puts you in the mind of Gone Girl, but this book is not as well written. Even though I pretty much read it in one sitting, it bogged down about 40% in - I couldn't see where it was going which you would think is a good thing, but there was just too much drunk Rachel.  I got kinda tired of reading it, but I rarely start a book and not finish it.  Besides, it picked back up after a major discovery and that made it easier to finish.  I read this because my sister read it first and wanted me to as well before we see the movie.  It's likely this will be one of the few movies that are better than the book it's based on.  3.5 stars"
"I will be honest the book was amazing. It pulled you in to the lives of everyone in the book. You felt there anger, pain, and confusion. You trusted and you were betrayed. You somehow become part of the book trying to figure out who killed Megan. It kept you captured with sleepless nights. Until the end. Sadly the ending left unsatisfied. It didn't quench my thirst on how the characters were left off. It just left you hanging, hoping for more but sadly nlothing else will come. I wished the author ended it without the cliffhanger, in my opinion. But all in all the book was great but ending sucked. So I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5."
"I'm bedridden after surgery so just finished reading Girl on the Train to pass the time.What I liked: the plot. I found it an unusual writing style to tackle the story from a commuter's perspective.What I didn't like: not one single character. For me, I don't have to fall in love with a character (I certainly didn't with Gone Girl and I loved that book). But Rachel, the main character was thin, underdeveloped, shallow, weak, self-pitying and a drunk. The book is told by three characters, Rachel being the main one. Anna is married to Rachel's ex-husband, whom Rachel still pines for. Anna is vapid, self-centered and flat out annoying. Megan (who is first known as Jess in Rachel's fairy-tail version of people she views from the train window) is mentally unstable with a sordid past.I figured out the ending about two thirds through. This was disappointing because I like to be utterly shocked by a book's ending. It's not the worst book I've read, but certainly not the best. It'll do."
"Very clever concept. I couldn't put it down and read it in four hours straight through, finishing up at 2 am. Rachel is a mess, but that adds to the suspense and I think a lot of women who've ever been cheated on could identify with her, and with most of the female characters at least on some level, no matter how dark and messed up they can be. Overall, I thought it was well worth my time and money and I'd read it again."
"A depressed girl lives in a fantasyland, refuses to move on, rides the train everyday, pretends to work, creates a life for some people she sees who lived by her old house. She gets so drunk all the time she has blackout moments. The girl she created a life for goes missing. She inserts herself into the investigation because she has nothing else to do. The whole book goes back and forth between what happened, I'm scared, she acts completely paranoid, and round and round we go. I just wanted the book to get on with it!!  Seriously how many times can we stand to listen to her internal monologue?  Not to mention this book is extremely depressing. Author needs an editor. I got tired of the same drivel that didn't seem to move the story along. And don't even get me started on how pathetic every single woman was portrayed in this book. I think the idea was good but way to slow paced for me."
"What I loved about the book was the concept. How many times have you driven past the same houses, same people, and imagined what their lives would be like? The story begins as a daily commuter, Rachael, who struggles with alcoholism, watches a loving couple from the train...(Jess and Jessie) she's chosen them, their house, because it is directly down the street from her ex-husband and his new wife - the woman he left her for....The storyteller has created quite a loving life for this mystery couple; an artist and a doctor!! Then one day, from her seat on the train, Rachel  witnesses what she believes to be adultery...Cursed with drunken blackout's, curiosity and just bad luck, Rachel awakes one morning, covered in blood, wounds on her body, with no recollection of how she got in this predicament...Rachel finds herself in the middle of a murder investigation...and possibly intimate with the murderer. Interesting, quick read."
"Paula Hawkins knows how to write a good book.  She knows how important it is to produce sentences and paragraphs  to keep the reader turning pages and in this book, the reader must read to the very end of the novel to find our 'Who Done It?""  In this day and time where grammar and punctuation is hardly taught in American high school English Classes, Paula clearly know when to use a comma, colon, or semi-colon.  I find this refreshing that there are writers out there who know how to use these tools.  Sometimes I think editors do not know how to write sentences, use correct punctuation, use the correct tense of a verb and other tools that make reading such a pleasure for one and all."
"I just couldn't get into this book at all.  I've picked it up multiple times, and just couldn't do it.  Part of it is the pitiful state of the woman - you could see her total inability to cope right off the bat - but the author beat it to death setting you up to realize she was not going to end up being a credible person when it really mattered.  Frankly I gave up - possibly too early - I suppose eventually she figures out the whole thing and is able to convince the authorities that she really has a clue - BUT I just couldn't bring myself to get to that point.  Bravo for those who were able to finish this book and  thinks it's terrific - I'm not one of them."
"Ms Hawkins has a problem here, but one that the publishers are happy to exploit - Gone Girl.There were always going to be comparisons, but the marketing opportunity was enormous, and it was taken advantage of. In fact, one has to wonder, ""What was the original title of the manuscript?""Standing on its own feet, it's not a bad read. Not the page turner various reviews had me expecting, it plodded along in sections, and wasn't helped by the stilted writing. Trains trundle more than once, sunlight is burnished, knuckles white on wheels... we've all read it more than once.  Given the structure, more adept character development was called for, along with stronger, more distinct voices. It was difficult to invest too much in the main character, and the men came across more as projections than flesh and blood.Having said all that, it would make for a decent read on the train to and from work.Probably safer than looking out the window, in Ms Hawkins' world."
"Everyone was talking about “The Girl on the train”. So I hopped on the bandwagon or should I say I hopped on the train too and bought the hard cover, not even the paperback. It seemed interesting about this girl who keeps admiring this couple she sees every day from her train window. It all fell flat…a psychological thriller it should be…I would psychological garbage…. The writer in my view is psychotic…..a lousy story with too much. She kept blacking out and can’t remember anything…too often…really makes no sense.I waste to buy the book and a waste of time on it…writer was just as drunk as Rachel in the story!"
"Don't be lulled into a false sense of security. Like the slow click of roller coaster wheels climbing up their first steep incline, this book starts slowly, lost in the mind of one woman whose tragic life is submerged in the blurring haze of alcohol where fantasy becomes easily confused with reality and self-pity comes as easily and frequently as fear and doubt. Then, just when the reader is beginning to feel this book might be moving just a little too slow to be worth finishing, the coaster reaches its peak. What follows is a hurtling descent full of twists and turns that will leave you gripping, white knuckled, into the wee hours of the morning."
"Not sure what all the fuss is about. It was a good read but not a great read. No one is a good person in this story or who they seem to be on the surface. Except maybe the long suffering roommate. Rachel is in a downward spiral and we are forced to go on the ride. She spots a young couple from her train she takes every day into work. She makes up a life for them, names them and projects her hopes or dashed hopes as it were upon them. Then she finds they are not who she thinks they are. Only they live a few doors down from Rachel's ex and new wife and baby. When the women she has seen from the train goes missing, she can't help but interject herself into the investigation. Rachel thinks she has a clue as to who might have taken her. Only she is a drunk and can't remember what happened that night. Was she there? Takes awhile to find out and when you do, your not too surprised."
"Okay, I can understand how this got to be a best seller. Kudos to Paula Hawkins for writing a hell of good debut novel. I expect to see more from her, though I wouldn't say I'm looking forward to it. The mystery unfolds slowly here but the plot's well crafted, not predictable, tedious or boring. While I was starting to figure it out before the author revealed it, the story was still far more suspenseful than most mysteries. Hawkins is also a very good wordsmith. So why only three stars? Frankly, I found the characters, complex and as well developed as they are, to be just plain depressing. Many reviewers describe the main character, and sometimes a few of the others, as ""unreliable."" I found the book to be full of unpleasant people. Not the kind of people I wanted to spend much time with. No fun at all, so because of the grim people, I'm giving it a grim three stars. Sorry..."
"Good read, it was difficult to put down. The early part of the book was mostly informational, introducing and defining the 3 main characters. I thought  all 3 were similar in some aspects and had to go back and recall which character I was reading about. This by no means took away from the enjoyment. As I continued to read, the characters became more defined and I could see them as different individuals with some similarities. The longer I read, the harder it became to put down.  Wasn't expecting the ending, but then, isn't that the point of being a good writer!  I am lookig forward to seeing the movie based on this book, it should be intereting!"
"Well, I read this book in two days, and was sad when I finished.  Not what I expected, but better.  The characters are well developed, but with lots of unexpected twists.  Just when you think you've got a handle on things, you realize you don't!  Not a book to pick up if you don't have time to really jump into it.  The movie is coming out soon, and I'm not sure how I feel about seeing it.  Usually, if its a really good book, I am typically disappointed by the film.  I think I'll see it, though,  just because I enjoyed the plot so much, and Emily Blunt is in it.  I am going to be looking forward to Paula Hawkins next book for sure!  GREAT read!"
I do not understand the hype about this book at all.. It was boring and drawn out and I only kept reading it so I could finally find out what happened. And it wasn't even anything crazy or twisted. I won't spoil it for anyone but be prepared to read a bunch of blah blah blah for the first 80% of the book and the blah blah blah didn't need to be said because it didn't make the end better. There was no omg moment. For me anyway. Thats what I was hoping for. And I didn't get it in this book
"This is a fun read to do with someone else especially since you can then see the movie and discuss. We both got confused with character and time changes, that caused us to have to pause and review a few times. While some revelations were predictable the collateral damage of the most volatile characters was not always. If you have read the book I wouldn't necessarily say you need to see the movie (unless like me, you were curious to experience another point of view,) however, if you have only seen the movie DO get the book-reading the thoughts of the characters versus watching them - totally different journey"
Took some time to untangle characters and story line but was a good read.
"I'm not one to post warnings for books and usually think people old enough to buy adult fiction should be capable of separating fact and fantasy, but this book- wow.. The hype about this novel is everywhere and so many reviewers rave about it,  so- to be honest- I purchased it without really knowing much more than it was about a missing woman, told through the narrative of a woman on the train. This is entirely my responsibility, but this book is hard to read.It is a page turner, to be sure.  I read it over the course of a few days, staying up far later than I should have, and sneaking pages wherever I could. I didn't particularly like it though- there are no sympathetic characters, and I felt vaguely sick each time I read.  I should've seen where it was going before I did.  I guessed early on who the ""bad-guy"" was, but didn't anticipate the level of psychologically terrifying domestic abuse and gas-lighting the author has the men in this novel heap on the 3 female narrators."
"I started this book quite a while ago and put it down bc the many characters' narratives were confusing and I got tired of trying to keep them straight. When the movie was announced I decided to give it another try. Once I decided to pay more careful attention to the change in voices and got to know the characters better, I got sucked in so strongly that I couldn't put it down! Another family member had the same experience! Now I'm delighted I gave it a second chance. I must admit to have guessed at the culprit about half way through, but the way that was revealed was terrific. And now I can't wait to see what they do to the story in the movie."
"I would not of probably chosen this book but it was given to me in an odd circumstance & I felt compelled to read it. I really enjoyed the way it was written as passages from 3 different woman's views, women, who given a different chance at meeting would of probably been friends.Unfortunately, this is not an option and the book leads you down a path between understanding each woman's motivation for their actions, whilst giving you a unique insight into their choices.The ending is worth the read and you may, as I did equally like the three main characters or have a different opinion. Either way, I recommend this book & if I could share with you the ironic way this book came into my hands, you would probably laugh and understand why I enjoyed out so much."
The book has a good start.  But 3/4 of the way into the book I knew where it was headed. The ending was so/so
"Truly, I did not find the main character a very likeable person. Her choices in life behaviors were abhorrent to me.  Not a main character I would like to read about, to get all into her drunken thought processes and behaviors as the book digs deeper.  But, I couldn't extricate myself out of the twists of the story, actually looking forward to the 'alternate person' storylines for something tangible.  While the mystery and writing kept me interested in turning the page (or in my case, the Kindle) and all the elements came together with satisfying answers....I was just left empty, with no real compassion for any of them.  I remember many other books where I find the character(s) so moving in one way or another that I miss them as friends, but when I finished this book, all I felt was relief....so glad I wasn't part of that community or their lives."
"I was expecting an exciting novel, but was rather disappointed. All the characters are unbearably uninteresting and, frankly, quite pathetic. The first two thirds of the book are spent detailing the excruciatingly mundane failures of our protagonists, aching for something, anything, interesting to happen.The pace picks up a the end, however the grand reveal is so predictable you lose interest in the story well before the characters become aware of what is going on.The writing is decent, but overall I would not recommend this. There are lots of better novels out there to choose from.Stay away from this one."
The three main female characters were all equally too neurotic. No depth to the characters to distinguish one woman from another. One drank (too much for her to do the actions described in the book) - one haunted by a tragedy but was more interested in controlling men through sex and the other just wanted a house away from the trains. Really? The men - both violent. These typical stereotypes of women and men bring the book down. And the red haired guy on the train- no development on him. He shows up - tells a version of the events and moves on. I would have like to learn more about the two detectives that did the investigation. They needed some personality/personal history not just facial expressions.The story line is very good. I finished the book because I wanted to see how it turned out. But reading the dialogue of those whiny women - was annoying and made the book less interesting. I did learn a few new British terms - thanks for that.
"Terrible book, couldn't finish it!"
Definitely would read again so twisted! Kept me turning the pages wanting more. I couldn't get to the killer quick enough
I could just never get into it.
good book. i read it fast
This book is a real page turner. But the ending is disappointing. I would still recommend it though if you are looking for something quick and easy to read.
Loved this book!
"An amazing, well wrote thriller that will keep you at the edge of your seat. I recommend this to anyone who loves a good thriller. Well worth the read!"
Ending a little bit unbelievable.  Otherwise suspenseful.  Great character development.  Can't wait to see how movie develops plot and suspense
Great read! Couldn't put it down! So glad I read it before I saw the movie. Definitely recommend reading this one.
Book is awesome!
"Rachel is “the girl on the train”.  She spends her days riding to and from London, usually well on her way to drunken oblivion, in an attempt to keep her roommate from realizing she’s been sacked from her job.  As she rides the train, sipping canned gin and tonics, she becomes obsessed with “Jess and Jason”, a couple whose house backs the tracks.  In her mind, she imagines the happy life they lead based on the glimpses she gets as the train trundles past.  At least until she sees Jess kissing another man on her deck.  When Jess goes missing the very next day, Rachel's reality begins to get significantly more complicated.Hawkins does a fantastic job of taking the facts and tearing them to shreds.  Just when you think you have it all figured out, you turn the page and poof, your theory implodes.  This is a page-turner that is packed with twists and turns you never see coming.  This is not a beach-read, however.  Make sure you have time to invest if you plan to see it through."
"I hesitated to buy this book due to the recent rash of negative critiques. Don't consider them, this book is a tremendously gripping, suspense filled take on a ""who-done-it"" style of mystery. I read it in 3 days. It flowed well, and the first person style of narration didn't throw me like some books do. I love a character like Rachel, the girl on the train... flawed, yet intriguing. She is like a modern day Bridget Jones in many ways, and the self-effacing manner in which she interacts with the others in her life is both disturbing and endearing. I didn't expect to be so drawn in by this book, so I was pleasantly surprised. American readers should know there is a fair amount of British wording and spelling, (""plaster"" is a band-aid, for example), but this didn't bug me. I would definitely recommend this book if you want to read something that you will enjoy, and something that might just keep you up reading until after 2 a.m.!"
"I have to admit that I hate books where the MC is a self loathing mess. While I have that out of the way, The Girl on the Train is an interesting read. She takes the story of a pathetic train rider, trying to hide the fact that she lost her job, and weaves it in with the stories of others living nearby. While there is a heroine of sorts, you can't help but shake your head at this collection of warped souls. No one is innocent and everyone has some sort of secret to hide. Although I suspect Paula Hawkins is being a little overly harsh on the human condition, but it is her book to write.It does get a little confusing in some dialogue points where I lost track of who was saying what to whom, but those points were few and far between. The flow was steady and the characters were sufficiently well developed that you felt for them and loathed them at the same time.Overall, a good book. I liked reading it and ultimately felt like it was worth my time and money."
"I was a little slow on the uptake realizing there were three different characters telling their stories. Once I got a clue I followed the story line better. The three stories are dated on each of their chapters, but unless you are compulsive about noting the dates, it's a little hard to follow where you are in the action in terms of the time line. Ultimately it comes together and the time line becomes less important.Altogether though, I think it was a well constructed story, interesting to follow. The most interesting character was struggling with alcoholism and I believe the portrayal by the author was very on target and fascinating to follow.Aspects of it make it not-such-an-easy read, but it certainly makes you think, and that's ok too.Generally well done - I would read another by this author."
"Really a 2.5 start review.One dimensional characters who, for the most part, I felt no empathy or care for. I understand that sometimes there are flawed characters that are DISTINCTLY flawed but I just really didn't find myself caring for the trio of leading females or their male counterparts. What I did like is the mystery and suspense in this one. While it is a big of a plodding story there were just (and barely that) enough hooks sprinkled into the story to keep me reading a little more otherwise I would have put this down and never picked it back up. In sum though a solid mystery it is really just a middling read with sub par damaged female leads."
"The Girl on the Train should not be read on my Kindle.  The chapter headings, providing an orientation to who is narrating and when, are indispensable to following the book, and in my case the essential information was illegible--or maybe I didn't pay attention, until  it was too late.  Also, don't attempt to read this book in fits and starts.  It will be frustrating to figure out who's narrating and when.  There are several narrators, and at least one is unreliable.  None are interesting.I wish writers would notice that drug and alcohol problems have already been written about very comprehensively.  I really am sick of the vomit on the carpet genre.  This books devotes way too much to attention to describing the perils of drinking.I guess the structure and characters are meant to create suspense and mystery, but I found instead confusion and tediousness."
"This book really annoyed me, yet I couldn't stop reading it. The suspense is what kept me going but I really didn't like any of the characters. It's written from the perspectives of Rachel, Megan and Anna and most of it is Rachel, ""the girl on the train"". Rachel is a drunk and I've never dealt with drunk people in real life but just reading about her drunkenness and blackouts exhausted me. This taught me to never read another book if drinking plays any part of the story. When I read mysteries I like to guess all along and try and put the clues together. The problem with this story (without giving things away) is that, the end is not what you expect, simply because the author didn't want you guessing, therefore, the storyline of certain characters completely changes to make sense of it all... When all along, that's not what you were told. I gave the book 4 stars just because it kept me interested, which is hard to do if I don't like ANY of the characters.... I finished the book feeling irritated."
"I read the book through and therefore will give it two 1/2 stars.Other than that, with all the publicity hype, I was surprised and disappointed at the quality of the writing, the interminable diary-like entries with the same literary voice, and the tiresome first person present throughout.That the characters are not admirable or don’t experience any semblance of personal growth by the end of the story is not necessarily a criticism. Although I do think some kind of moral reflection makes for a stronger and more memorable protagonist. It’s okay to have the dregs of humanity populate your story, but in this one, they move through it like a bunch of snakes in a pit – not thinking beyond their most primal impulses.I give the writer credit for keeping me reading, having created a certain amount of tension and suspense.  But then I take it back for letting me down in the end.  I wanted to care about Rachel, Anna and Megan but in the end all I wanted to do was be rid of them and their tedious soliloquies."
"The novel is written with the interesting strategy of moving from the mind of one woman to another of the three whose lives are intertwined in unfortunate ways.  I was confused by that at first and couldn't get a sense of what was going on or how I was supposed to interpret this.  But in time, the connection of each to the others began to gel and then I was in.  The characters are interesting and dark in different ways and the actions of each has affected the lives of the other two in devastating ways although none of them knows the others very well.  The suspense grows toward the end as you begin to realize that you're finally going to find out just who did what and the climax was riveting.  I wouldn't have recommend it while reading the first several chapters but I hung with it and I'm glad I did.  Worth reading and the story continues to haunt me a little bit days later after finishing it."
"I actually bought this book back last year. I tried to read it a couple of times but just couldn't get into it. Well now that they've made a movie out of it I figured I needed to try again. So, I plunged in. I've read other books like this one where it's really a slow moving book, they just don't keep my attention. I'm giving it three stars just because others must have seen something good in it in order to make a movie from it. Even though I finished it I'm sorry but I just wouldn't recommend reading it. I know there are others that I'm sure loved it, but I love murder mysteries and this one is just too slow moving for me."
"Since the novel was proclaimed as the next Gone Girl, I was eager to get started since I loved that book. Rather than a real psychological thriller, it turned out to be a regular who dun it..not the type of literature that I typically enjoy.Although there was an interesting mix of women, all who were suffering in some way because of motherhood, some of the sections seemed to drag on and on.As the author portrayed the alcoholic binges of the main character, I believe that she wanted us, too, caught in the downward spiral.  That worked the first one of two times around, but then became a drudge to read.If the who dun it genre is your reading style, you will probably enjoy it.  For me, it was just okay."
"Omgosh--definitely the page-turner. An hour on gym treadmill literally flew by while reading this book. Really exciting psychothriller type story, with multiple POVs... can't wait to see the feature film. Apparently actress Rebecca Ferguson of the awesome new Mission Impossible is going to star, alongside the very talented actress Emily Blunt. This book really isn't like Gone Girl, per se, except in the sense that someone is murdered and it is a thrilling fiction read... as this book is quite mysterious until near the end (with GG, you know pretty quick that the wife is a crazy-arse beeyatch who is framing her hubbers) as you don't really know who did the deed. Also, this story is a full-on ensemble piece. Omgosh, know that I'm gushing but this is a book to re-read and can't wait to see the film. Hope the author writes more thrillers, will definitely read. Happy reading~*"
"I'd heard so much upbeat comments about Girl On The Train, that I had to try it.  I'd ridden on trains in England 12 years ago and enjoyed it immensely watching the countryside and seeing the backs of little houses and their yards. I can see the pull of this context of a disturbed and very hurt girl losing herself in the same views from the train day by day.  In some ways it was a very intriguing story, but for me there has to be at least one character I want to pull for....cheer on...see him or her through to the end.  In this book there were no such characters that I latched onto and committed to and worried about. Every character in this story was someone to worry about...and many had very dark undercurrents pulling and pushing them to sordid doings.  So, yes, I did finish it and gladly put it down.  It was not uplifting, but if you like dark, sad, depressing mysteries then this is your cup of tea. Everyone to his own taste. See Gee"
"I am not going to bother to run a synopsis of the book, you can already see that in the description in the listing.  I am so enjoying this book and I am only through the first 80 pages or so.  I am actually reading a bit at a time because I want it to last, LOL  The characters as well as, the plot-line, are very well written.  I was drawn into the story and involved by the first few pages.  For me, that is the hallmark of a very, very good read.You become the characters, you live their lives, feel for them, dislike them, and cheer then on.  Also, as a Brit, the authors  description of all things British are spot on!"
"For me this was a GREAT read.  I enjoyed every moment of life within the lives of its characters.  The author reveals events, feelings and interchanges of the characters at a steady pace holding my attention and wanting to read on.  Chapter lengths were the same way. I related to the main character as I have had a drinking problem and experiences many of the same feelings and decisions as she did.  I hope I can now enjoy the movie more from reading the novel and if  it  dose not compare positively I will enjoy thinking about the differences and relive the pleaseant experience of  reading the book."
"A sad joke concerning those who are substance abusers asks ""How can you tell an addict is lying?"" Answer: ""His/her lips are moving."" Really not funny, but it supports a basic tenet of this book: every character is a liar. Most of the story is told from the point of view of a severe alcoholic, who looks into the homes of people whose houses are near the railroad tracks of the train she is on. She invents stories about their lives in between her drunken stupors. One day a murder occurs involving one of the people she watches; she decides to try to solve the murder on her own after lying to the police, making up her own story of what she believes happens. No spoiler alert here about what happens and who's involved. Suffice to say, the title of the book is a bit misleading: when I saw ""girl"", I thought the book would feature a young girl and her adventures on a train as it crosses the English countryside. Reading about a whino whose husband dumped her is not my cup of tea."
"I was fairly entertained by this book. Nice twist at the end. Got a little long in the middle with the unreliable narrator, Rachel, and her going on and on about the same things. Anna and Megan were just annoying sometimes. My basic problem with this book is the lack of someone to really root for. I had the same problem with Gone Girl. I didn't like any of the characters enough to truly feel invested in them. Although I liked the 'just desserts' for one of the baddies in the end. That was satisfying. I liked this book well enough to keep reading. Maybe I was a bit underwhelmed because I expected more with all the hype about it. I'd give it 3.5 stars."
"""The Girl on the Train"" definitely had it's ups and downs. The main character - an alcoholic spending half the book in a drunken stupor - was infuriating, frustrating, and downright depressing. There were times where I felt truly sad for her, and others where I rolled my eyes at her terrible decision making. There are only a few characters in this novel at all, and none of them are likable. The plot had a lot of promise, though the end was more of an over-dramatized Lifetime movie and less ""Gone Girl"". It was a fun read, but nothing that shines in terms of mind-blowing twists and turns or characterization."
"I have heard the characters were all mental cases - yep to some degree they were.  A girl with a vivid imagination watched homes and the people who lived there from the train every day. Imagining their lives as stable, peaceful, loving, she couldn't have been further from the truth.  As an alcoholic, the girl became a different person when she drank too much, became involved in the lives of the people she watched from the train and almost lost her life because of that.  The surprise ending was handled very well by the author. I have a lot of responsibilities, so I am not one to read a book through at one sitting; therefore when I would have to take care of duties, my mind was constantly on the book, wondering, wondering - what next!  Good book and it would have been a real page turner if I had the ability to do that.  Really loved the way it was put together, with chapters on the main female characters. Really enlightened the understanding!"
"I liked the story although it took a while for me to get interested.  I am not a fan of the journal type of writing.  I did not care for it in Gone Girl, and I prefer a story that is written in the first person.  However, that being said, I'm not sure how the suthor could have written this novel in any other fashion than the way she did.  I alternated feeling angry and sympathetic to Rachel.  She was her own worst enemy.  She did so many things without thinking through what the ramifications of her actions might be.  You just wanted to shake her to wake her up.  I am very interested in seeing how the movie handles the characters of this novel."
"Read this book in a day! It's a true page-turner. Similar to Gone Girl, but BETTER! Way better! Highly recommend!"
Thrilling and interesting. Grwat read
Held my interest.
"Based on the reviews of The Girl on the Train, I was anticipating a well written psychologically sound thriller. Right up my alley. But no, it was a dead end. I found the dialogue tedious. The plot lacked intricacy. The women - Rachel, Anna and Megan - were drunk, depressed and disappointed while the men lacked credibility. I read the whole book. I've never before written a book review but have read and depended on many, so I felt I owed to potential readers to share my negative opinion."
Great read!! Better than Gone Girl. Can't wait for Paula Hawkins next book.
"I have trouble staying interested in a lot of books, but this one definitely held my attention. I highly recommend it!"
I need this book for this weekend ?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!??!! ThaT'S WHY I PAY EXTRA DAMN??!?!??!?!??!?!
they werre all different
One of the stupidest books I've ever read - not sure why this author even bothered -
This book is a real thriller. It has a slow start and quickly became a page-turner. Definitely recommend!
"I've heard so much about this book and was excited to give it a read, but was seriously disappointed once I read it. The ending was easily predictable and it started out very slow. However, I ended up reading the entire thing to make sure I wasn't missing anything and to say that I read it. I personally wouldn't recommend it, but I know others who really enjoyed the book."
"I loved this book, and couldn't put my Kindle down while I was reading it. I thought the approach was fresh, and for me at least, not predictable.  I liked the author's style in releasing information a bit at a time rather than revealing everything all at once.  I had heard so much about the film that it made me curious about the book, so I decided to read it before I saw the movie.  I still haven't seen it, and heard it's not as good as the book, but I think few films ever are.  This is not the type of book I'm usually attracted to, but I found it to be a thoroughly enjoyable reading experience."
"I was sooo excited to read this book after all of the great things I heard about it.  It took me a couple of tries before I was in the right frame of mind to read it.  For me, there was too much of the book wrapped up in how drunk and miserable she was.  This part got old fast and made the story drag on.  I guessed who the villain was way before the end of the book.  I think I would have liked it more if the main character, Rachel, would have made more attempts to improve herself throughout the story, even as she was embroiled in her obsession.  Her pathetic nature just kind of overshadowed the whole book for me."
"My curiosity was piqued by this novel upon seeing it at the bestseller list for quite a while, at the same time I was quite skeptic as to how this could be such a bestseller.With the first few pages I was drawn to Rachel's life and how during her daily train travel to and from her new home she would watch her previous home and her past wonderful life at the same time admiring the couple three houses down. She has in her mind that they are happy - Jess and Jason was what she named them. Then suddenly things are not what they are.I loved the switching of point of views. At the same I wanted to shake Rachel to tell her to stop drinking, stop with those bloody black outs, I wanted to know what she saw/remembered. The Girl On A Train is engrossing and will keep you guessing. I did not see it coming and at the same time toward the end of the book, I was like - why is my least favorite character involved...what...and then I went oh...I get it now."
Too slow. It requires a lot of patience. Style of writing makes it further boring . Could have used direct method of story telling and should have made it a thriller easily. Though story line is good and convincing yet does not make an absorbing reading.
"This book is terrific from 1st page to the last!!! The characters are so well developed, and the author switches from one to the other very smoothly. The main character is a woman named Rachel, and it is she who rides the train everyday, giving the reader a bird's eye view of what she sees, and what she imagines about the people that she sees everyday. Her imagination takes over reality, but we soon find out that the real lives of these people are much worse than what she imagined for them. We also get to know Rachel, and all about her sad battle with alcohol, and also her ex-husband and his new wife, who are prominent characters in the book. The book is never boring, and these people are so interesting, and so complex, that you just feel compelled to keep reading. It is definitely thrilling, and the moodiness of the grey weather in England is the perfect background for the story."
"Wonderful British murder mystery but more than that, the protag is a drunk, something we don't see much in novels. She is struggling with alcoholism and her credibility is compromised. I loved this twist.TGOTT is a murder mystery that takes place in the suburbs of London England. A woman who's been replaced by her husband (in his life and their house) notices the neighbors from the train and becomes engrossed in their affairs. It's a case of voyeurism and more.The novel is written beautifully, flawlessly. The mystery is compelling with the author feeding us just the right amount of information about each character to let us think they could've been the killer. Well done."
"The Girl On The Train is a well-crafted, suspense novel told from the perspective of three very different women.  It is full of plot twists and turns and unpredictable until the very end.  Although the storyline is quite depressing, the well-developed characterizations of Rachel, Megan and Anna are realistic enough to elicit sympathy and caring concern.  The women are all flawed, as are the male characters, who are all damaged in one way or another.  The underlying theme seems to be:  ""Oh, what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.""  Our view of life can often be deceptive, since things aren't always what they appear to be, as Rachel eventually learns from her view on the train.  The final resolution  and conclusion were well thought out and perfect!  Paula Hawkins is an excellent writer with considerable insight into the psychological, narcissistic workings of the human mind.  Her debut novel is riveting, memorable and not to be missed."
"""The Lorien Legacies"" are a continuing book in the ""Pitticus Lore"" series that began with ""I Am Number Four"" (which was the best of the lot. I have not yet read ""The Light Between Oceans: because after the first few pages, I found that the subject matter (stealing a child by a woman who could not have her own) was more sad than dramatic. ""The Girl on the Train"" was well-written, but there were too many plot twists that really strained credibility and it portrayed women as weak and virtually helpless without a man in their life. I found that point of view disturbing."
"This would probably be considered a psychological thriller, and that it was indeed.  I never guessed what was coming until almost the end of this novel.  The characters were well-developed with great description and  excellent expression of their thoughts and feelings.  The story is told primarily from one person's point of view, but several characters, especially the other two main female characters, also weigh in and add to understanding the story. It is set in London, and the regular commuter train running through the story ties all the characters and settings together.  There is a strong message that you can never fully know what another person's life is like despite how things may seem. It is a creative and absorbing story that was impossible to put down once I got into it.  Highly recommend!"
Intriguing
Absolutely LOVED this book  Amazing beginning to end.  Now I need to see the movie!
Great story!
Loved it ( much better than the Movie Version )
Girl on a train did not get downloaded onto my kindle. Can you help?
"Sorry, but this definitely is not up to the standard of ""Gone Girl"" or Hitchcock!  The main character is not at all likeable nor sympathetic.  Her self-destructive behavior becomes repetitious and boring.  The ending is predictable and unoriginal, like a B movie.  Don't waste your time."
Couldn't put it down!
Maybe I was expecting too much based on all of the hype.  I was disappointed.
"The story itself did not match up to the write up about it. It was lackluster, I did not identify with the main protagonist who maintains an alcoholic stupor pretty much throughout the story. The ending was just awful. If I wanted to suspend reality throughout the entire book I would read fantasy or sci fi, not fiction.Don't waste your money!"
Such. A. Great. Read.
". . . is that it gets you deeply into situations when you have only a small understanding or even a BIG MISUNDERSTANDING of what is really going on.  This situation gets even more complicated when the misunderstandings are multiplied by three different narrators, Rachel, Megan, and Anna, each with her own assumptions and misunderstandings about the other two.  And when one is an alcoholic (not recovering, unfortunately), and the other two are seductresses caught in love triangles with one another’s husbands, friends, and therapists, then it gets really complicated trying to figure out what’s real and what was only imagined or misunderstood.  That this entire narration is so interesting, really so captivating, is to the credit of author Hawkins’ considerable skills.  Not a comic, but a tragic tale, and well worth the time."
"I usually read Sci-Fi and Fantasy, with quick jumps into literature and non-fiction for a break to get an idea of what is happening in the literary world.Didn't know what to expect with this book, but the idea of unreliable narrator is always fascinating; and this book pulls it off with great aplomb.The pathos that the author is able to generate for the 'main' narrator (there are three viewpoints in this book') is impressive. I actually felt sorry and disgusted for her, in equal parts.Caveat : I never liked Ignatius in Confedarcy of Dunces, just didn't do it for me - but this worked.It's a gripping read, fast paced. Just a really well told yarn.And if, IF, anyone cares, yes, the three viewpoints are all female; but this is in no way a 'female' oriented book. It is just a good story, told in an interesting way"
"This was a pretty good story, the author didn't leave any loose ends open. It was a little bit predictable though. I had an idea of what would happen in the end, and I was mostly right. It definitely keeps you glued to those pages though. The characters aren't really at all like able. Rachel is just a sad mess. Megan is very unfaithful, although I did feel a little sympathetic towards her for certain reasons that you'll find out if you read it. Anna just seemed so whiny and just basically did everything Tom told her to do. No mind of her own almost. This is definitely worth reading though if you're into thriller/murder type books. I'll be excited to see the movie when it's released!"
"This is a book i can see becoming a made for TV movie one of these days starring Tori Spelling.  It reads just like a movie, building suspense the entire book until you finally found out who the killer was at the very end, with a nice unexpected twist.  You spend the entire book thinking that every character could've done it.  The book is a pretty fast read once you get into it, which is nice, if you are looking for that.  What bothered me was the main character, i did not find her likable and most of the time pretty downright annoying.  I wanted to shout at her ""get your s**t together!!"".Overall it's an entertaining book, my book club gave it mixed reviews, so i wouldn't necessarily tell anyone not to read it, i'm just not going to rave about it.  If you like a good ""who done it?"" type book that is a fast read, then this one could be for you.  I love a good murder mystery, but i need a little more."
"Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning and night! Every day she rattles down the track.  She watches the cozy homes and sees the same couple daily and has even started to feel like she knows them.  Their life-as she sees it is perfect, not unlike the life she recently lost. And then she sees something shocking and becomes entangled in the investigation and the lives of everyone involved.When I first began to read Girl on a Train, I found it dark and depressing.  I put it down several times as I could not become interested in the daily train rides and I found myself asking, ""Is this all there is?"" As I read through the first chapters, however, I became spellbound and couldn't wait to read on.  The story keeps you on the edge with riveting tales of intimacy and betrayal.  The characters are well-developed.  One feels a combination of emotions for Rachel including pity, empathy, disgust, and admiration.  I didn't want the book to end!"
"The beginning of this book was very slow and even towards the end it wasn't very exciting. When the book finally climaxed, it was good however I feel as though it wasn't good enough. The very ending of the book for Rachel was disappointing; during the climax of the books she became so strong but the ending described her as essentially the same person before a tragic situation - the only difference her being 20 days sober.. the previews for the movie over the novel and the description about the book really lead me to believe this book would be very exciting which sadly it didn't meet expectations..."
"This book was a quick read, it pulled me in almost immediately and did not let me go until I finished. There is a feeling of nostalgia throughout the novel that gives you the feeling that you are talking to an old friend you haven't seen in awhile, one who saw you through some difficult times. I am not the best person to review mystery novels because I usually guess who did it before the big reveal. However, I thought the author did a pretty good job of making you doubt what you thought (although she did so by painting every male character as menacing). The main character, Rachel, is pretty sad. You immediately feel bad for her and as you delve further into the story you realize just how pathetic she is. None of the characters are particularly happy or well-rounded people, the women in this story lead especially depressing lives."
"Lives up to most of the hype it has been given. And I don't say that very often when it comes to bestsellers.If I only have one criticism of the novel, it is this: the author plays with our minds a little too long and some of the suspense began to wane (for me,at least). If perhaps she would have pointed me in the direction of the killer, a little earlier, and showed the minds of the other suspects (that we all contemplated) just a little sooner, I for one would have been happier. There did come a point where both my wife and I - we read it aloud to one another - were like ""get on with it, we're ready for a climax here.""Believe it or not, there were a few grammatical mistakes (IMHO). My daughter found them as well. Otherwise it is a good quick read. I highly recommend it for anyone who likes mystery and suspense."
"If you're looking for a book that sets women back decades, if not centuries, this is a winner. Written from the perspective of 3 women, there isn't a single characteristic of any of these characters that women should be proud of. None of  the female characters have anything going on outside of the men in their lives. As Paula Hawkins tells it, all members of the female sex are unfaithful, useless, unambitious, jealous alcoholics defined solely by their ability to procreate. Meanwhile, men are just for being disloyal.The author has so much disdain for women, she can't even be bothered to call us women in the title. Instead, we're just girls.Please don't perpetuate this shallow view of women by spending a dime on this book."
"Slow build up to a predictable and terrible ending. The ending was wrapped up so fast and easy that it left me angry. Plus, I don't think some characters would act the way they did in the ending. I don't understand why the author included some items detail throughout the book and never made them relevant.Overall, this book had me interested and I liked the format, but it only let me down completely. Who wraps up a story like this in a few paragraphs?"
"Go on to amazon.co.uk and read the book's reviews there for a more accurate take on the book.This is not a thriller. During the first 70% of the book this is an examination of the angst suffered by three unlikable middle class British housewives The plot is wafer thin and is presented via exposition and resolution in the last 10% of the book. If you are looking for the next Gone Girl, keep looking"
"I was recommended this book from Buzfeed's article about books with plot twists. Plot twists, this book did deliver, but all the action is in the last hundred or so pages....all pages  before hand are so much of Rachel drinking, either puking or crying, forgetting what she's doing or has done....just over and over. It got old after a while. Once the plots twists finally came, it did get exciting and I will admit I was shocked and surprised. I ended up appreciating 2 characters I loathed in the beginning. I would've  rated this higher if Rachel weren't so hard follow and hard to *want* to be on her side."
"I absolutely loathe having to push myself to finish a book and that is exactly what this book is forcing me to do.  I'm sad and annoyed that I spent the money on this one, which is why I feel the need to read to the end.  All of the characters are annoying, thin, shallow, and fairly bland.  The main character is amazingly stupid with her constant whining about messing up and then doing the same things over and over.  The worst part is having to read the same scenes and thoughts repeatedly . . . talk about boring!  I saw the ending after the first couple of chapters, but kept telling myself ""no, this has to get better than that!""  It didn't.  I'm honestly surprised and appalled that so many people enjoy this book.  It's nothing new or interesting past the free preview section, in fact it's just more of the same contrived garbage all the way to the obvious and bland ending.  Where are the good and enjoyable novels anymore?  Not here, I can promise you that!"
"I am not into murder-mystery books. At all.I cringe at the suggestion of them. Just not my thing.However, I kept seeing this book at the top of the lists and it had over 500 hold requests at the library--so of course, I had to read it. There must be a reason it's so poplar, right?I got the Kindle sample but it wasn't enough. So I bought the full version and, well, it sucked me in. At first because I could relate to Rachel. Then the story started to unfold and things were twisting and turning and I simply could NOT stop reading.I suspected one person for the better part of the book, then another, butNever who it turned out to be, although thinking back, there were plenty of clues.The author did an amazing job with this! I'm impressed!Normally I am not happy with the way these books end, but I was actually pleased with this one. I felt peaceful about it.Good read. Highly recommended!"
"The book has a strong plot. If you like mysteries, I recommend it. It moves along at a steady pace and has an interesting style: It is written from the point of view of primarily three women, mostly two. Early on the voices of these women were quite different, but as the book progressed it got harder and harder to distinguish them, which might have been intentional. I didn't know ""who did it"" until it was revealed, so kudos to the author for that. My main complaint is that I didn't find any of the characters likeable, but that might be less of an issue in the movie (I love Emily Blunt)."
"A murder mystery with twists and turns reminiscent of Gone Girl.  Rachel, an unemployed, alcoholic divorced woman, rides the train pretending to go to work every day in order to keep her unemployment a secret from her landlord / roommate.  Every day the train stops at a signal, where Rachel people watches and makes up imaginary scenarios for a couple that lives in a home across the tracks.  One day Rachel sees something shocking and decides that what she has seen will help solve the disappearance / murder mystery of the woman she has been watching from the train.  The police, understandably, do not find Rachel a credible witness.  She becomes increasingly, obsessively involved in this mystery.  Told through the voices of the different characters in the story, jumping back and forth in time, this story is engaging and well written.  I enjoyed it very much.  The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I figured out the end of the mystery about 3/4 into the book."
"I got off to a slow start, had to re-read the beginning to keep the key characters apart.  The three primary characters are all speaking in first person so at first they were all running together, to me.  But after the first few chapters, it hooked me.  It is a true ""who done it"" - and I was surprised.  Had some theories through the whole book but they were knocked away."
"Many suspenseful events in this novel that it was difficult to predict until the very end.  The main character Rachel, seemingly simple and bored  is actually quite complex.  She had many emotional problems of her own creation, so it was difficult to understand her behavior and whyshe continually made poor choices.  This developed a love/hate relationship for her character.  A good read!!"
"finally gave in & bought this book because of the reviews & popularity. It certainly is a page turner but I felt uncomfortable & uneasy thru the whole book. I wanted to shout at Rachel aren't the words ""no"" or ""appropriate"" in your vocabulary? Anna was truly evil & Megan was somewhat of a loose cannon. The men were awful, how could 2 such alike persons live doors away from each other & be involved with the same 3 woman. The set up of the book, days divided into morning & evening was alright but in some cases the story went back in time & had me very confused.  I'm not sorry I read this book, it just left me with some morbid feelings. Not scared, just creepy-like every noise in the house made me jump. Would i recommend this book to anyone? If you enjoy reading & experiencing different scenarios go for it. But read it real fast, very easy to do, & have another book to delve into right away so those creepy feelings don't stay with you."
"I found the first 70 pages quite boring and had a hard time getting into this book, but I began to like it a bit more as it progressed. It may be confusing at first because the story is told from different narrative points of view, three to be exact, and because it is not written in linear or chronological order; it goes from present to past and back again, so the reader has to look at both the date and the name at the beginning of each chapter to ascertain from whose point of view the chapter is being told and when the events occurred. The three main female characters are not very likeable and have unpleasant characteristics throughout the book; however, they become more likeable at the end which is the best part of the entire book. It dragged at times, and I wasn't really engaged in it during most of the book, but once I got into it, I wanted to finish it."
"I liked the way the described the feelings of each of the female characters, you can see traits of yourself in each one of them, they are so realistic.I would mainly recommend this book to women, men may find it hard to connect with, since it has got a female point of view.I gave it a 5 stars rating cos I found it very well written, and although it is a fiction novel, you get. So mucho involved in the plot."
"I was hooked after the first page...and because I was stuck on an airplane going overseas I read the book straight through.  I loved the development of the story..good character development for this type of genre and the story was very clever and fresh.  It definitely had that familiar GONE GIRL suspense element that draws the reader through the book ""looking"" for answers.  I felt that the story was well crafted, did not give hints about the ""truth"" for at least three quarters of the book, adding doubts and twists along the way so the reader is not really certain until almost the end what really happened.I would absolutely recommend this book as a fast read, one that you really can't wait to get back to reading. I sort of hated for it to end because I was rooting for the main character and was curious about what was going to happen to her...but was glad to finally have closure on the story."
"Thin, repetitive storyline. We've heard this plot before -- but never as poorly executed. The characters, dialogue and premise is a huge cliche. It's sort of like a British Desperate Housewives of classless losers on Blenheim Road -- except the TV show, Desperate Housewives, was inventive, clever and entertaining in its tongue-in-cheek comedy/drama/mystery. Here, everyone on Blenheim Road has a secret ugly scheme.The characters are one dimensional, boring and any reveals are trite and telegraphed long before you read them. Despite the fact that Rachel and Anna constantly and intensely clash throughout the entire book, here's a revelation that Rachel has in the last quarter of the book: ""Something's not right and I can't shake the feeling that it has to with Anna.""  Really? Ya think?? How did this book get so many thousands of 4 & 5-star reviews?? Something's not right -- for sure."
"I was very engaged in reading The Girl On the Train!  It drew me in immediately through its tone and setting. I wanted to find out more about this girl on the train. What did she see? Why was she on the train?  The tone was mysterious and I wanted to know why!I was drawn to Rachel's pain. I couldn't imagine why she sought such relief through her drinking. What kind of pain drove her to seek out oblivion.  The description of her drinking was well done.  Her pain is palpable, you can almost taste her drinks and you can almost feel her hangovers.A painful tale of hurt and deception and ultimately triumph I believe.There was unfinished ideas that kept me from five stars. It left some significant holes that needed closure."
confusing characters..movie prefers don't appeal to me either..would not recommend this book..i am an avid reader and just finished the book because it have been on best seller list for so long..thought it would get betterb. crane
"I found the main character, Rachel, so pathetic at first that I wasn't sure if I would be able to finish this book.  Since it was was selected by our book club, I pushed myself to keep reading.  It did get better but was pretty predictable. The story is about a women who watches a couple from the morning train while she commutes into London.  She watches them out on their back patio and has made up fictional names and fictional lives for them.  One day she sees something that doesn't look right to her and this puts her in a tailspin.  Her ex-husband happens to live a few doors down from this couple with his new wife that he left Rachel for in her old house.  This complicates things because she cannot let go of the fact that she is still in love with her ex so she ends up stalking him which puts her in a position to stalk the other couple as well.  There are lots of twists to the story but I saw a lot of them coming before they happened."
"Well, I just wanted to write a review that would've helped me if I had seen it before reading this book...If you're bored and need something to do, read it, but it's not as notable as the hype was all about. It was slow and the only great part was the end, not the ending though. It all builds up to one point, and you have to struggle to get there. The lives are intertwined very unrealistically and everyone is painted as the ""bad guy"". I do like the view of the book through an alcoholic, it adds a different feel and makes you doubt what you are reading. This book does not compare AT ALL to Gone Girl. Not even close."
"I really enjoyed reading this book.  My sister loaned me her audio copy but, I had a hard time staying focused on it.  I gave it back to her and bought it so I could read it.  It was much better for me to read it, I think because of how she changes the perspective from one character to another, it was easier for me to follow the written version.  I have bought another hard copy to give as a gift."
"I liked the idea of the book but not the complete execution.  It's difficult for the reader to really like or relate to any of the characters.  Although I did feel like the descriptions of Rachel's battle with alcohol to be sometimes somewhat compelling.  I really did feel her want/need for a drink.The reader is trying to figure out 'who done it?' BUT the author did not really give us enough clues for us to have any idea what she had in mind. I partially understand that is because we are supposed to be seeing through the eyes of the various characters but I felt as if I wanted a little more depth and nuance that would clue us in (ever so slightly) as to what the endgame would be.  When things become apparent, I was surprised but didn't feel enough excitement for the 'AH-HA' moment.  I felt like I was kind of cheated by being completely blinded from all of what was really going on."
"I bought this book for my wife, and she has had nothing but good words for it. She has tried a number of times to get me to read it and I'm sure one of these days I will. We have the Kindle version so unless we lose our e-reader the book will always be available. My eysight is bad so I am subscribed to a Talking Library organization and they recently sent me a recorded version of the book. If they have it in their collection it has to be a good book. Doing this review has brought the book to the top of my list of things to do so I have to get started on it. Book reviews and my wife highly recommend this book so I would say get it, and enjoy!  JLM"
"It was terrible.  The two main female characters Rachel/Megan were consistently unlikeable.  No redeeming qualities.  Hard to stay with a story when you don't like the characters. The story line was confusing, ""is she lying"" or ""isn't she"".  That got old. When it could be followed, it was uninteresting.  I gave up a little past half way and skipped to the end due to a book club review.  All of my book club felt the same, and we rarely agree.  ""Best seller"" because large numbers of people were buying it under the premise that being on ""the best seller"" list means it is well written.  Not so."
"I hate books and movies where all the suspense is created by the narrator being an idiot, making avoidable mistakes. This tale is told by a drunk who creates all of her own problems and whose myriad mistakes made while hammered are only reason book isn't 50 pages long. I figured out who did it pretty early on, which is not to say im that smart, but that this book is that unsmart. It is similar to gone girl in that it's an unreliable narrator situation (which seems to be the only way that anyone can write an interesting suspense novel these days).  Not hitchcockian in the least----pretty TV movie. This is a thinly veiled attempt to capitalize on Gillian Flynn's writing style,  but not well-written or sufficiently entertaining for me to read the remaining third. Save your money and your time---I wish I had."
"I truly hated this book...annoying character who kept getting drunk...just plain uninterested in what happened to anybody.  I CANNOT understand the popularity unless we are a truly dumbed down audience or the marketing department is very very good.....There are so many wonderful books out there, don't waste your time."
This book was such a disappointment.  80% of the book was a page turner written by a gifted writer. However the conclusion is so juvenile one would think you were reading a 15 year old's high school assignment. The literary quality of the book completely fell apart at the end.
"Although Ms. Hawkins' writing style is engaging and original, I found the story to be overly gruesome and the turn of events unbelievable.  None of the characters were likable - there was no one to root for - and I grow ever more tired of stories about people whose only concerns are getting laid and ruining their health one way or another.  This will perhaps make a mildly diverting made-for-TV movie one day, but steer clear otherwise."
"I have to say, I found this book depressing, boring in some spots, and hard to read. I grew up with an alcoholic mother, so this was tough reading. for me.The story keeps switching around the 3 ladies in the book and it got tough staying on point. I agree with a few reviewers that Anna and Megan should have been built up more, although this book was all about Rachel.Rachel in an alcoholic and has a 'black night' of drinking and the entire book works around, ""What happen that night."" It was a good mystery because I never guessed who the killer was until the end of the book. But getting to the end was tough. You have to pay attention to dates and who is talking to even figure out what is going on.Reading fiction is supposed to take you away and be relaxing. This is not that kind of book. I'm not sure I even know what happens to Rachel, I was so caught up in trying to figure who was telling the story in this book. For me, it just solved the mystery, but I didn't feel that the story of Rachel ended. Maybe it was just me.Even though most reviewers have reviewed this book above 3, I would not recommend it. It was not a pleasant experience for me. Please understand it could be because of the alcoholism, that isn't a pleasant memory, and it took me back there. I only bought this book because of the +20 thousand people who reviewed the book. I know more than that have read it, and for me, I wonder why?"
"On the plus side while I could put this book down I did feel a compelling need to go back and finish it.  There is an engaging mystery and a truly scary climax.  Three stars for that.On the minus side--the three main characters are women who in a sense are clones of each other--totally focused on the man in their lives and on actual or wished for children.  No careers, no quirks.  Weak and drippy.  The overall mood of the book is depressing.  When these characters did something strong it was either recklessly stupid or out of character.There is also the Agatha Christie cliché of the culprit at the end spilling the beans about what really happened while someone is (figuratively) tied to the railroad tracks.  That was old with Agatha Christie.The originality and unique take on contemporary life that you'll find in Gone Girl is simply not here, plus the whole view of life and women's lives in particular is just a downer.  The writing is okay but the three narrators all are alike in how they express themselves."
"WAS THE WORST BOOK EVER!!!!!!So many lost opportunities, a poor plot line and NO twist or connection in the end between the characters:Tom? what? who cares about that guy. He gives his story up so easily in the end, really? he doesn't even transform as a character before that.What happened to all of the pieces of clothing that Rachel sees on her trips? that provides suspense in the beginning but means nothing.The ENTIRE story about Megan really doesn't mean anything - in the end, it doesn't even matter that she had/killed a baby (it doesn't even have anything to do with her death), the dr. Abdul guy storyline is a total waste.Scott is the lousiest character ever - what is the whole end fight with Rachel for?And Anna just puts her girl to bed and has a beer when Tom is confessing? lamewhat about the guy with the red hair?"
"I'm actually surprised that this book is as popular as it is, when there are so many good ones out there right now.  I've seen this book compared to Gone Girl, and I don't understand because while it has a similar premise, (missing girl, murder, intrigue) it was entirely less interesting and surprising, although I will admit that The Girl on the Train did keep me in suspense for the first half.  It seemed like the author had a great idea with a girl on a train, studying people's lives as she passed by, but then it got muddled by a bunch of affairs and entirely too attractive people.Ultimately I was rooting for this book to be better, but the characters were not relatable or realistic in my opinion, and it seemed like I was watching a soap opera."
"My book club selected this book.  I wasn't even half way through and had to torture myself to finish it.  Very slow moving, somewhat predictable, with characters in bad places who are so unlikeable that you can't even feel sympathy for them.  Too many people making bad, selfish, stupid choices which will lead them to the inevitable.  The train rides take up a large portion of the story, which was mostly dull. I could not in good conscience recommend this book to anyone."
I wanted to like this book. I did. But it was SO morose and depressing. It was horrible go through the main characters alcoholism with her. Perhaps that is a credit to the author. I had figured out who had done it about half way through. Initially I was totally confused as to whose voice I was reading and had to go back and read again. I just wasn't paying attention to the chapter titles. By the end I felt myself thinking that that was a very depressing trip without a lot of excitement. I mean I read the whole thing. It was okay. Not sure what the hype is all about.
"A cleverly constructed story written from the perspectives of the three main female characters, Rachael, Megan, and Anna.  Rather than numerical chapters, each chapter is named for whomever happens to be telling the story from their point of view at the time.  This transforms into a gripping and exciting yarn about love found, then tragically lost.  It touches upon the insidious and hopeless consequences of alcoholism, infidelity, and ultimately cold and calculated murder.  This is not a happy story with a fairytale ending.  It left me feeling glad it was over but satisfied I stayed with it."
"I have never understood the fascination with books about mentally unstable protagonists. Personally Like with ""Gone Girl"" I find it very hard to either connect or sympathise with these unstable and very often unpleasant characters. The drunken heroine never really grows or develops beyond the initial introduction and she is just boring by the end of the novel. The fact that the second wife turns out to be as unstable as her does nothing to mitigate the boredom, in fact you just begin to wonder if there are any normal people in this fictional world or if everyone is determined to be dysfunctional."
A very good read. Story is told by three female characters. Mood is ominous all through the book. Rachel is the main character. She is divorced from her husband who has remarried and has a daughter with his new wife Anna. Rachel is not able to accept her changed situation even though she initiated the divorce when she caught her husband red-handed with Anna. The marriage was falling apart even before as Rachel was not able to conceive. Rachel takes a train every day to London even though she has lost her job there. She watches her old house and a neighbor's from the train. She is able to observe what is going on the porches of these home. The couple in the neighboring house seem to be greatly in love until one day Megan the wife is found murdered. Murderer's identity remains secret almost until the end.
"I found this to be a solid, enjoyable thriller. The story is told in the first person by the three female protagonists. One of the threads is deferred significantly in time. This structure works quite well to produce the suspense on which the success of this type of narrative depends. It perhaps falters a little however in its depiction of the male characters. We see then through the women’s eyes but really don’t get enough food for thought about them to enable us to make an educated guess about their role in the novel’s key event. It terms of style, it has its moments, not least the following keen observation about the British urban landscape:“a 1960s new town, spreading like a tumour over the heart of Buckinghamshire. No better or worse then a dozen other towns like it, a centre filled with cafes and mobile-phone shops and branches of JD Sports, surrounded by a band of suburbia and beyond the realm of the multiplex cinema and out-of-town Tesco”"
"It was well written, but excruciatingly boring. The only excitement I felt was when I was finished. I can't imagine why they would make this book into a movie, that would be a total bore.Besides the very end of the book this wasn't very interesting. None of the characters were likable, in fact I hated them all. Not one favorite. Waste of my time."
"I enjoyed this book - it kept me interested, but all-in-all, it was just okay. It reminded me a lot of Gone Girl, which I liked better than this one. I felt it dragged on a bit (she's a drunk, we get it), but it was still suspenseful. I did guess (correctly) who the killer was mid-book, so the ending wasn't very exciting...it was just a confirmation of what I already knew. Would I recommend it anyway? Probably."
"A slog of a read.  I stuck with it to the very end, but it's only really gripping in the last 2% (I read on Kindle).  The timeline can be ignored--it adds nothing but confusion and helps the reader not in the least.  The writing is pedestrian.  The characters not sharply delineated, they tend to blend into each other.  And enough with the booze motive.  It got it right away, and the author just belabors the same stuff over and over.  Probably better off if you pay the money for the movie.  The cost would be similar, it will take less of your time, plus you can have popcorn.  Not recommended."
"This book had me guessing one thing was happening, when it was quite another.  It was a very decent read, but I can't help feel it could have been so much more with the premise and start of the story being as thought out as it was.  The story revolves around a divorcee who binge drinks and her inability to be a 'reliable' witness in a missing persons case. This could have gone many ways, but ended up with all the males in the story being  users of the women they were with in many different incarnations. This was more the crux of the story; rather than being a mystery (which it still was) it was also a statement on the abusive side of relationships. I would go 3 1/2 stars, but you can't do halves.  It's better than average and and entertaining to read, but still have that gnaw in my gut that it could have been plotted into something much more.  I think the author has a good start to her career here though."
"I am at a loss why everyone is raving about this book and find it ""hard to put down.""  Rachel is exhausting - at first you feel sorry for her and empathize with her, but after about 100 pages of her grasping at her formal life while she is constantly drunk - it gets old really quick.  Anna is a the girl we all hate - loving playing the mistress and enjoying every second of knowing she is stealing a married man.  Megan is just a clingy train wreck, and the men are all portrayed to be scary/sleezy.  Like Gone Girl, there really isn't one character that you can actually like let alone root for.  Halfway through the book I guessed the ending...there is only a handful of characters, so it's not hard to figure out where this is going. Zero twists, worst boring ""suspense"" (I use the term loosely) book....can't believe they are making this into a movie!"
"This book kept plodding towards the inevitable. I knew who the killer was early in the book. Yet I kept reading in fascination, thinking that surely it couldn't be THAT obvious. Well, it was obvious. I found the main character, Rachel, to be really pathetic and, quite frankly, kind of weird. I did not have any sympathy for her at all. Please, don't waste your time reading this book. I don't know why it got so many great reviews."
"I had to drag myself through this book from beginning to end, and I only finished it because my Book Group is reading it. I thought the writing was shallow and the characters, all of them, were vague and difficult to relate to. I was particularly impatient with the main character, Rachel, in that I thought the author was using her repeated alcoholic episodes as a crutch to extricate herself from having to fully write the exposition. I notice that this book has been compared repeatedly to another terrible book, ""Gone Girl"", and I think that is accurate. If you were impatient with the bad writing, plot and character development in ""Gone Girl"", you will find the exact same weaknesses in ""Girl on the Train"". Inexplicable plot development, unclear and superficial characters, a boring, boring story, and an unsatisfying ending. Don't waste your time."
"I could not believe that Ms. Hawkins could write a book where the ""Girl on the Train"" was such a sad character who happens to be addicted to the awful disease of alcoholism.  It is a shame that this disease's consequences were used to create a most predictable story.  How anyone can say that this is the next ""Gone Girl"" is delusional.  Shame on the author."
"I so wanted to like this book! The beginning was slow but I had nothing else to read so I continued. Then I starting hating the main character because she hated herself; her decision making was beyond poor and her drinking was beyond boring.  In fact all the characters were exaggerated caricatures of ""flawed"" people.  But it was the ending that killed this book. Without providing any spoilers, I absolutely could not believe the ending of the book!  It read like a tired Law and Order: SUV episode (I actually said out loud: are you KIDDING me?).  Before killing off the witnesses, the killer sits there and confesses while everyone drinks tea. Then the protagonist plans his/her suspenseful escape (read the book to see if the escape was successful).  Completely predictable plot line with a boringly predictable ending. Totally unrealistic.  The premise was interesting and might have been better developed by a different author.  This is my honest opinion on how I felt about the book, and what I would have wanted to know before I read it."
"The first chapters of this book got me hooked, but it soon became tedious to be inside the mind of a self pitying alcoholic for so long.  Every character in the story was despicable, which does not bode well when one has to spend so much time inside their heads . When the mystery was finally revealed - after too much drinking, whining, and sniveling by nearly everyone, but especially the main protagonist - I was angry that I'd wasted both my time and my money."
"The book is written in the same switchback method as 'Gone Girl' and for a while it's an engrossing thriller.  However, the train slows down in the last  30 pages or so, and the killer and ending is not the shocker one would expect from this highly praised story.  More character development would have helped but very little background is provided for each, and what there is exists mostly in conversations.  A good book, but not really deserving of all the hype."
"I have the biggest problem with what passes for psychological thrillers these days.  This and ""Gone Girl"".  I got nothin'.  As in ""Gone Girl"", not one of these characters is (a) likable, (b) believable, or (c) all that interesting.  So why keep reading?  Our protagonist, Rachel, is anything but.  She's so irritating that you want to reach through the pages and slap her around.  Truly, she has so few redeeming qualities that I was not rooting for her in any way, shape or form.  Kind of wishing she was the one that got offed.  Any time there was a stupid thing that could be done, she managed to find something even more stupid and then do THAT thing.  Then she'd get drunk, black out and feel even worse.  I should have put the book down when she vomited on her roommate's rug and then pitched into a drunken blackout and left it there. (Oh, was that a spoiler?  Sorry, my bad.)  And then, you know, there's that thing that happens where after the first four chapters or so, the story is laid out and then nothing much happens -- it's just filler -- until the last chapter when everything resolves.  So there are about 100 or so wasted pages.  Not great.  I'm sure they're doing casting calls for the movie as I write this."
"The whole premise of this book was so insipid, like the writer was noodling around for a cute idea to write about as she sat on the train to work. And she started writing and wasn't at all sure where to go with it so she tried making the characters intriguing, but they weren't. Many of the voices were so similar you couldn't tell who was speaking except by looking at the very pale gray label at the top of the page. The people she portrayed were really pathetic, totally lacking a raison d'etre in life. I finished the book because I had nothing else to read at the moment."
"This is a horribly boring ""thriller"". To me there are three key elements to every mystery/ thriller - plot, character, writing. This book is sadly lacking on all accounts. The plot is ok but I figured things out about half way through and I kept plodding toward the conclussion (counting the pages to the enevitable end). The characters were sad, one dimensionioal set pieces that never come to life. The shifting narative was gimmicky at best and a lazy writing style at worst (meaning all we can expect of Ms. Hawkins is more of the same). I have no idea how this became a Number 1 best seller on the NYT list (I guess because of suckers like me). By far the worst book I have read this year (15)."
"I have to be honest even with all the amazing reviews I still think I barely liked it.  I bought it because of the zillion good reviews and I am sure that is why most are buying it.SPOILER:I am ok at predicting plot twists but I feel like this one was very very obvious. I mean from the second they tell you Megan babysat and he smiled at her and then a few pages later ""he"" smiled at her driving by it was very obvious that it was Tom...I mean you can't help but compare it to Gone Girl and although I did not like the ending of Gone Girl , Gone Girl blows this book out of the water. Flynn's book is so smart and clever this is kind of boring and mostly about an alcoholic who you don't feel for and I could not even get myself to like a single character or be interested in any of them.I did not care for it at all to each his/her own."
"All I can say after forcing myself to finish this ""novel""  is that the book should have been called the drunk girl on the train. With its predictable plot, undeveloped and unlikeable characters, ""The Girl on a Train"" reads like something one would pick up at an airport newsstand to kill some time. I was numb with disbelief when the ""mystery"" was revealed at the end. I couldn't believe the author would pull the most obvious literary trick out of the hat to reveal the murderer. The lead character is in a drunken fugue for most of the book but clarity returns right at the end along with a smug confession by the killer.The key players were a circle of six which included a pathetic drunk, a mistress-turned wife, an adulteress, a serial liar/cheater, a paranoid husband, and a shady therapist...with some random red-haired man thrown in the mix. No wonder it garnered so many ""five-star reviews,"" and being adapted into a movie...it's suspense-lite that appeals to the masses and will have many flocking to the cinema to see this easy-to-solve-mystery. Most notably, many of the five star reviews are from professional bloggers and vine reviewers who receive free ARC's. I suppose that one too many a critical review would stop those freebies from coming.I am so irritated that I bought this book in hard back, but I guess this is my comeuppance for buying into the summer book reading hype. Hitchcockian this is not, not even close."
"The concept of the story is good, but the book rambles on and on with a predictable two page conclusion.  Don't waste your money on this one."
"I was not fond of this book because the characters were all such awful people. One after another, they were so messed up.  The book was redundant, yeah, we know Rachel is a boring drunk, we know Megan is a loser.  Both men are horrible!  I can't believe I finished the book. No surprises, since we already knew Megan was having an affair.  Duh.I know we all have our flaws, but I truly have never met anyone like these people.  Maybe I'm just lucky, or don't live in the bottom of a barrel."
"I have about 75 more pages until I'm finished with this book. Yes, it's been dragging along for me and there are a few reasons:  1. The main characters lack real depth. I want to empathize or ""side"" with at least one of the characters but being unformed, they come across as one-dimensional and simply self-absorbed; 2. The book lacks suspense. The pace of the book is erratic because the author jumps back and forth in time for all of the main characters. These ""interruptions"" stall any suspense that should be building and growing and; 3. Like a STEREOTYPICAL day in London, the tone of the of the book is grey and gloomy which equated to dull for me.  I really wanted to like this book like the majority of reviewers and be able to tell friends and relatives, "" You really need to read this book!""  Not the case here.......but that's just my opinion."
"I was so disappointed in this book.  Hours of listening to an audio book that was full of codependent, bad decision making, weak women.  I kept hoping something would get better and that there would actually be at least one character that I liked and it never happened.  I must stop falling for books just because they are on a best-seller list.  Bad choice on my part and a lesson learned to read customer reviews before I buy."
"Sorely disappointed and difficult to follow especially on a device - had a hard time figuring out who was who and who belonged to who - finally had to write down a flow chart so I didn't have to flip around in my Kindle. And Rachel - honestly, she was ridiculous ---are there people really and truly that stupid? I know there are people who are stuck and cannot make a good decisions for various reasons, but Rachel takes the cake. Not worth reading. Sorry I wasted time on this book."
"Not one sympathetic character in the book.  Five main characters and not one of them has any redeeming values.  If this is the world Hawkins lives in, she has my utmost sympathy.  It is one of the worst books I have read in a long time and I read a LOT of books. If you want mystery/thrillers stick with Sandford, Child, Connelly, Silva, Flynn, Baldacci, Coben, DeMille, Thor, etc.  Do not spend your time or money on this book.  You'll regret it."
"I hated the book. How much? Well, this book pissed me off because I just couldn't finish the damn thing. I read about 45% of it and put it down for a few weeks hoping I could start it fresh and become more engaged in the story than I was during the first half. I was irritated because I have rarely walked away from even the most boring, tedious tale.I'm a reader, 60, educated and a male. This doesn't put me in the target audience. But I could have enjoyed the ride if it just moved along a little or if ALL the characters weren't petty, self absorbed basket cases. Their responses to what befalls them each individually seems trite and/or illogical to a fault. I wanted to throw the Kindle across the room as Rachel stumbles along on what is either a quest to solve a mystery or a road to redemption. That was about 70% of the way through the book. But the straw that broke the camel's back came when I realized that we're getting narration of past events from a character whom, by all rights, shouldn't be able to do that. And that's as close to a spoiler as I'm willing to get.Obviously I'm in a minority group of dissenters here and granted. For the folks that love this story, more power to you, your money was well invested. Also, I'll grant the writer due credit for skill in structure and character development but I found the whole thing boring, boring and a snooze. I had no sympathy or empathy for a single character in this book. Nasty, nasty people with nary a redeeming quality between them. If they were at least interesting..."
"I gave it one star because the author wrote it but I did not like any of the book. I do not like to read about alcoholics, did not find any saving grace in the life of a woman who let the end of her marriage push her to the limits.  Where was her self respect?  There is a sinister allegorical theme woven throughout the story. Unless you want to read misery, skip this one.  Okie Reading Specialist"
"I absolutely agree with all the other one-star reviewers.  This book was a big disappointment.  It's a blow-by-blow description of the protagonist's days, which early on gets boring.  The characters, especially the women, are self-involved losers who refuse to improve their lives.  In fact, all the characters in the book are stereotypes; none is interesting.  I hurried through to the end of the book just to get it over with, and I too wish I had my time back.  So much for a New York Times best-seller -- that praise means nothing."
"Though the book has dominated the NYT bestseller list for months, I was not impressed.  From an English mystery, I expected more color, an eccentric sleuth with more expertise, a distinctive setting, a little charm, perhaps a dash of humor;  instead, Train offers an alcoholic slouch with a dreary commute to nowhere.  The biggest mystery in the book is the heroine's blackouts.  The murder is so banal, without passion and inept that it is literally a crime committed without a trace of motive or evidence.  The heroine, generally in a drunken stupor, has some encounters of interest but mostly stumbles around totally clueless and solves the mystery completely by accident.  The accidental solution to the clueless mystery, finally gives readers a taste of redemption and a glimpse of evil.  This is not a case of leaving the best for last; those ingredients could have spiced up the tale and made the ride less tedious."
"Careful reading at first will help the reader get the five main characters in focus, and some patience is needed with Rachel.  However,  one is so rewarded by the exciting plot as it unfolds, taking the reader through twist after psychological twist.  I enjoyed the luxury of POV renderings of each character, and the clever way the author left clues for me to think about as the end rushed toward me like a Runaway Train trying to reach its station before the good are not saved and the bad are not caught..  The author makes you care so much for each character, regardless of their weaknesses. Will their strengths of character emerge to bring this complicated human puzzle to a satisfying end? Or will the reader be left asking more questions and be enticed to want more about the future of these characters and those their lives touched?  What an intriguing ride!"
"Ugh, the best part of this book is that it eventually ends and you feel better.  To me, the mystery notwithstanding, the hardest thing about this book was how incredibly hard it was to like ANY of the characters.  I find it very hard to read a book when I'm not able to really root for anyone.  But, I thought it was a decent enough mystery.  Didn't figure it out way in advance of the end but the possible murderers that the reader is supposed to suspect come across as so deliberately red herrings.  So it becomes a game of who's left after you eliminate the other possible suspects.  If this were not a book group selection I probably wouldn't have finished.  However, it gets two stars instead of one from me because at the end, I did develop some empathy for our drunken heroine.  So, there was that."
"I agree with some other reviewers. The characters in this novel were all annoying and not believable.  The main character, Rachel, you just want to reach out and smack some sense into her.  I just keep reading so I could be done with it. It is one crazy female after another, surrounded by awful men. I fail to see why this book is getting so many good reviews. Stay away."
"Well, it is definitely a summer chick book.  The protagonist, big surprise, is a female, whose life is falling apart.  In the spirit of Rear Window (only Jimmie Stewart does it justice) she sees something that's not right and immediately she makes a gazillion unfounded assumptions (like Rear Window and that other flick with Shia Labeouf).  It gets interesting, finally 2/3 into the book, but you can tell that the target audience of this book was not male.  Woman will love the personal relationships sprinkled with the protagonists imagination, and they may even identify with the other female characters in the book, but overall, it was like watching a trainwreck:  I couldn't NOT finish it, but I;'m not sure I wanted to.  Ladies, you'll love it.  Guys, try Secretary Gates' book or An Army at Dawn this summer..."
"Two things led me to pick this book to read. First one is the fact that this book belonged to psychological thriller genre and second is it being the top seller on Amazon for consistent weeks. However, after completing the book, I should say it was an above average read (falls short when compared to Gone Girl). The story as it progresses is quite intriguing and keeps the reader hooked, but as it nears the end, the story becomes a tad predictable. The story is centered around Rachel, the protagonist who is made to believe that she doesn't remember anything after black out, but one day she ends up being a witness to a murder when she is totally drunk. How she decides and interprets the events of that day forms the crux of the story. I definitely liked the way, the story is presented with careful juggling of the events from the past year and the present date. To summarize, I would say it is a good read."
"This was an enjoyable book with plenty of twists and turns to keep me turning the pages. While there were parts of the book that were predictable, Hawkins does a nice job of keeping the reader guessing about the outcome. While at times I wanted to know more about certain characters in the book, they were developed well enough that i found myself connecting with them emotionally from start to finish. The story is told from the viewpoints of the three main female characters (Rachel, Megan and Anna), which adds to the mystery and emotion of the story. The pace of this book is enjoyable - while I was eager to get to the end of the story, at the same time, there were moments when taking a rest from the sadness that often defined Rachel's life became necessary for me emotionally. It was a good book, and a relatively quick read."
"This was so badly written I gave up at 50%. Writing from three different women's perspectives yet they all sound just the same? Unbelievable sightings from the train, shallow character development. Why is this so popular??"
"It was a downer for the most part .  Rachels alcohol issues were way overstated, and none of the characters wereParticularly likeable.  They all seemed needy, spoiled, neurotic, or vacant.  What I disliked most was that she waspretty vague at the beginning when you were trying to figure things out, and then she discloses pertinent information toward the end. For a mystery writer, it's sort of a cheating tactic. Better to have good clues throughout the book that continue to unfold to build the mystery evenly.  It was very spotty and uneven,and none of the characters had much depth or character!"
"Very enjoyable!  Hard to put down.  The author, characters and plot make you want to keep going right until the end.  I tend to get so caught up in the action that I read less for comprehension than to FINISH!  As much as I enjoy switching between the characters voices, the change in the time was more than I could manage easily.  But the book was written well enough so that even if you weren't paying attention to the dates, you could almost always figure out when you were based on the events.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that it's been so built up in the media, by the time I read it, it was less than I expected."
Easy reading
"The story was compelling from the beginning, even though it took awhile to get into it and figure out how it was written. Each chapter is told from a different character's viewpoint, so we learn the 'truth' about things and then another's perception of the same things. The main character has lost her job, but rides the train every day into town so her roommate won't know she is unemployed. Suffering from low self-esteem, she drinks more than she should and subsequently suffers from the occasional blackout. She passes by the same houses every day, and has made up stories about a particular couple, imagining their perfect life. When the female part of the couple goes missing, the main character inserts herself into the investigation, sure she has information that is valuable. As the mystery deepens, she then wonders if she was somehow involved, as she had a 'blackout' episode at the time of the disappearance. For me, the plot took a strange, unlikely turn, and the lead character was not a very sympathetic character. The format reminded me of ""Gone Girl"", which was a much better story."
"I really wanted to love this book and had high hopes based on other reader comments.  I greatly enjoyed ""Gone Girl"" but this book pales in comparison.  The 3 female characters with alternating POVs are all pathetic. Their middle class problems seem so first world and were not compelling.  One of the females, Megan, and one of the 2 main male characters, Tom, are conveniently compulsive liars and cheats and no one ever meets the parents or family of either (Megan's family conveniently dead, Tom's estranged) -- it felt so contrived! Then to add the final insult SPOILER ALTER -- pathetic Rachel (who is a white, educated, middle class adult, presumably in her 30's) ends up having everything worked out when her mother coughs up some money for her to get back on her feet and get a fresh start. Rachel didn't do anything real to rebuild her life or improve herself. Saved by mummy's money. Ugh!"
"Ahh, the hot best seller of the season... A good read, a solid story with solid writing and a cautionary (don't be a boozer) nugget to boot. The seemingly good characters turn out to be much worse people than expected--and visa versa. We observe a semi-likable protagonist swimming upstream against a current of alcoholism, trying to clear her head and remember what happened the night she came home bloodied and a woman from a nearby neighborhood vanished. The ""surprise ending"" seemed over the top, a bit of story-telling hyperbole that didn't really fit with the tone and weight of the preceding tale. A decent book that proves once again the fallacy of looking for greatness or literature among the best sellers."
"I probably would have enjoyed this more were it not for the countless ""NEXT GONE GIRL"" and ""HITCHCOCKIAN"" promises thrown around in countless reviews. I kept waiting for a twist that never came, and I was disappointed. An ok book, but nothing special ...and certainly no Gone Girl."
"The Girl on the Train, I'll admit I was sucked in from the beginning. I grabbed a bag of chips, ordered pizza, and prepared for an intriguing night in. Just me and my book. The back-and-forth, 3-narrator structure was a bit confusing at first, but I could forgive it because it added a touch more suspense and depth to the story. However, after I finished the last page (and last pizza slice) I found myself a bit hollow. The story had somehow gone from an interesting premise to an ending so formulaic, so obvious, it was, well, ludicrous. I figured out the culprit about halfway through, but I was sure I had to be wrong, that the author just wanted me to think that I knew. And I waited for the twist that never came. As I read the last few paragraphs of the climax I couldn't believe how ordinary an ending this book was turning out to have. Ms. Hawkins succeeded in churning out a uniquely premised mystery only to muddy it with a Lifetime movie ending. ""Our heroine is beat till she's bloody and battered, and just when you think she's defeated...she shocks us all with her heroic sleight of hand""....spare me. Too many coincidences made the story unbelievable and worthy of more than a few eye rolls. I gave three stars because I like her writing style and it held my interest, but the ending fell flat--like Drunk Rachel."
"This sounded so good, and the first few dozen pages were good — the three narrators do a decent job of pulling you into what begins as parallel romantic dramas, with the bulk of it all being narrated by Rachel, the ex of one of the two men (who live a couple doors away from one another). Rachel has a drinking problem, as you will soon experience in repetitive, unending, mind-numbing detail. And she has a blackout on the night in question which haunts her, because it's during that blackout that Something Happens (that's not a spoiler, it's the whole premise of the book.) Like I said, the set-up is ok, and the stories are involving, but about halfway through you realize that you're only halfway through. What, is there an index at the end that takes up a third of the book? No. I suppose to make the story plod along more ""realistically,"" the author pads the tale with a mountain of repetition (oh did I say that already? Maybe it's contagious!)  — thoughts, conversations, situations, over and over and over. It's funny — the other characters get very tired of Rachel's drama, and you can't help but sympathize. She's just as boring as drunks generally are — so I suppose the author should get credit for accurately portraying a bore. Towards the end, I wasn't even reading it anymore, I was just glancing at paragraphs to get the gist. And after all that work, the big reveal feels more like a big letdown. Skip it — you can't get those 20 hours of your life back. I say go read ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"" instead."
"I can't believe all these four and five star reviews!  I had to plow through this book because I found it not only boring but distasteful, like Gone Girl.  All about sleazy people whose main occupation was having sex with each other.  The means of telling the story--first-person snippets by the three female characters--struck me as sloppy writing, an easy ""out"" that let the author not bother with the finer details of plot. And the people were not interesting!  Their lives, including those of the men, were incredibly shallow..  I am an older reader but I don't object to sex in stories, just to sloppy writing about people that are so dull and uninspiring.  But this seems to be the new trend in best-selling books which speaks to me of how readers' tastes have deteriorated."
"Almost aborted in 1st chapter.  After several, I skipped to last chapter.  That's all I needed. Rest was a laborious bore."
"It was not the worst thing I've read. But it was very, very far from the best. The author's writing is technically fine. And she does do a good job of depicting the characters and scenes. Well, that is she does if her intention was for the reader to not just dislike the characters, but to utterly abhor them. I realize that to some extent we are not supposed to like them. But usually with a cast of unlikable characters there is some redeeming value somewhere. This book had none! I didn't like the characters, but more importantly couldn't have cared less about what happened to them. I struggled to finish this book. Mostly I kept thinking I was missing something - it has gotten such great reviews that I felt like maybe just around the next page there would be something to like. Alas, there never was. A previous review stated it well - the characters are ""not merely unlikable; their un-likability is forced and exaggerated. Rachel's convenient blackouts happen so frequently as to become tedious"". Everything about this book was tedious. I can't imagine the soon-to-be-released movie will be any better!"
"I didn't start reading this book until I saw the movie trailer released. I wasn't sure what to expect. I'm certain this is one of the most suspenseful and dynamic books I have read in quite some time. The characters were relatable and complex, human and ordinary, like the person sitting next to you on a commuter train. I lost myself and the passing of time as I continued reading. I felt bad and hated each character so thoroughly I didn't want to come to the end. Great read and can't wait to be disappointed by what Hollywood leaves out in the theater."
"My sister had raved about this book so I made it a point to buy it when a discounted price became available.  Hawkins writes well and her story is quite good but I have never met a bunch of less likeable characters.  Perhaps, as a very literal person, I missed her point if Hawkins intended to portray everyone so negatively, but I like at least one person to root for in a book.  The central character was incredibly weak and seemingly proud of her inablity to pull herself out of her neediness and addicton.  The other characters were angry, selfish, violent, and/or not terribly bright.I will credit Hawkins with keeping the ending fairly opaque until near the end but this is not a book I particularly enjoyed.  Plus now I have to fib to my sister."
"I had started to read Gone Girl, but, didn't finish it because I thought the characters were pathetic people. Which, by the way, takes very good writing. But, it didn't work for me. Partway through The Girl On The Train, I thought I had another Gone Girl on my hands. No way!! I could not stop reading this book. At first I thought Rachel was just a sad, pathetic person, but, as I read more I saw the depth to her character. There are plot twists and surprises I never saw coming. I was impressed with the book. I never read books that someone ""recommends"", whether that person is a friend, celebrity, or book critic. But, my daughter told me that she heard this was good, so, I gave it a try. By the way, my daughter has the audible version and it quite impressed with the work of the voice actors and the story itself. I totally loved this book. I would read something else by this author."
I did not really like this I do not see what all the hype is gone girl was better
"I really enjoyed reading this book, I can say that probably is one of the best books I've read so far, I don't want to write any spoilers, so just keeping it simple, I will say that it had a great pace, well built  characters, the story will definitely keep you hooked the entire time, and you just need to get to the bottom of everything. I gave it the highest rating, because lets face it, the book was so freakishly awesome. I wouldn't change anything, it's a masterpiece. I totally recommend it to any avid reader who enjoys a thriller book, with some romance, suspense, and complicated situations. Thanks to the author, I look forward to read some more of her work."
"I didn't like this at first, and I thought the author had some trouble distinguishing the voice of some of the characters, but got better as it went along. Well worth the read in the end."
"I don't like to criticize any author who spends hundreds of hours writing something for readers to enjoy.Clearly, Paula Hawkins' perseverance has paid off for her since she's been on the best seller lists for many months, so who am I to go against public opinion--and the NY Times critic?At the risk of sounding ungrateful, I have to complain a bit.Using an ""unreliable narrator"" device can be tricky. There ARE authors who handle it  really well---( A Pleasure and A Calling by Phil Hogan does this beautifully, for example. ) For me, after reaching the end of Girl on a Train, rather than being delighted at being fooled, I was annoyed.  The narrator's ""inner thoughts,"" aren't really honest ones --she holds information back from whom?  Herself? Plus  the plot has so many holes in it that even the most bumbling detective would have figured out just what went on."
"The story was good, you felt for the main character and how she was dealing with her life problems.  I had a hard time staying engrossed because the author chose to not only switch between different characters' voices by chapter, but she also skipped around in time sequence.  The ending was something of a surprise.  I wouldn't rush to buy another of her books, though."
"This book was an easy read but I am not sure why it got such outstanding reviews.  Although the book was suspenseful I did find it predictable.  Too bad, I am not sure I can agree either that it was Hitchcockian.  But for those who enjoyed it, good for them.  I on the other hand don't understand they hype....Though some of the relationships were believable, others were far fetched and contrived.  Too much emphasis was put on the ""blackouts"".  Their purpose of them seemed to me to be giving the author creative license because heck she was too drunk to remember. It was a good premise but a disappointing delivery. This is my opinion, I don't like giving to many details when reviewing a book, in the event someone would like to read it anyway.  I did not hate the book so I did give it a 3 for the suspense, but with so many positive reviews this book fell short."
"I found this highly touted book to be quite boring and frankly tedious.  The main character is wading through a quagmire of depression, delusion and gin and tonics in a can.  Most of the book takes place on a commuter train; the heroine is in an inebriated haze throughout.  As a psychologist I appreciate the difficulties of depression but this book does not handle the subject well.  All of the characters are hard to empathize with so one is left with ""no horse in the race"" to root for.  There are a couple of mild surprises but I seriously would not recommend this book to any of my friends."
"I must admit that it took me two different attempts to finish this book.  The first time I started it I just couldn't really get into it...maybe because I do not like books written in the ""first person"" and I found the separate individual chapters disconcerting.  Since knowing that the highly anticipated movie was coming out shortly and the incredible number of weeks it's been on the NYT's best seller list I decided to start the book again. I did  finish it, I am glad I did, but I didn't like the writers style and thought that it certainly did not live up to it's hype."
"Read the book because I wanted to compare it versus the movie which opens in theaters today.The story is told by 3 different women. Rachel, the jobless alcoholic; Anna, the woman who married Rachel's ex-husband; and Megan, a woman that lives four doors away from Anna and Tom (Rachel's ex-husband). Each one has issues in the past and each one is ""flawed"" in their own way.I really enjoy a good plot twist and this book does not disappoint. It's been a long time since I stopped what I was doing to finish a book because I HAD to find out how it ended!"
"I read this after it was recommended by a friend. I thought it was fast paced & interesting. I'm not a big fan of ""amnesia"" murder stories because it's all too convenient. It's also frustrating! The chapters are written in different point of views. Not only do you have to pay attention to which character is narrating the chapter, but what the date is for that chapter, too. I also found it sad that I didn't like any of the characters. Every time I thought that maybe a character was okay, something would occur that would change my mind. All of the main characters had some kind of mental health issue. It did manage to hold my interest and I didn't want to stop reading. It was suspenseful and entertaining."
If the story moved a little faster I would have given it a better score.  The story focuses around an alcoholic with little communication with others until about the middle of the book.  She knows she is an alcoholic with no life but does nothing to make her life better.  She basically sabotages anything positive in her life.  The last part of the book is the best part as that is when the most action occurs.  It's not hard to figure out the ending.  I wouldn't totally write this book off as it was an okay read.  I will admit to skipping some pages as they dragged on going nowhere.
"I can't believe how popular this book is! None of the main characters are likeable or nuanced. The female characters all share the same character flaw which guides their poor choices. Bunch of doormats willing to put up with significant weaknesses in their interpersonal relationships who keep repeating the same self destructive behaviors.  The male characters are self-centered and misogynistic.  Yuck.  The storyline is billed as mystery, but it's not a very iintriguing plot. The ending is not realistic and not satisfying, I guess in large part because by then I disliked the main protagonist so much I just didn't care about her ""happy ending."""
"I also hated this book. It is so boringly repetitive, the plot moves at a glacial pace, but my main complaints are about the writing. If the author chooses to use three narrative voices, there should be at least SOME differences in how they sound. Not here - if you missed the name of the narrator at the beginning of each chapter you are out of luck since not only the voices, but even the content of their tales is pathetically similar. What a waste of time and money! How could this book be on a bestseller list for so long is beyond me. And, by the way, I thought Gone Girl was fine."
When this book was compared to Gone Girl and a Hitchcock like ending I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. The vacuous characters and confusing back and forth time lines made my head spin.  Never could get a grip on what the point was.  Why the hype?
"No spoilers here.I thought the story was decently written and accurately portrayed the issues the characters were facing in the story. However, more character development could have been done, and I think that the shifting narration sometimes detracted from the story. For me, it was not too much of a thriller or very suspenseful. I think some plot points that were supposed to be twists or surprises were spoiled with heavy-handed foreshadowing.In short, it wasn't a bad read, but it was far from the best suspense/thriller novel that I've read."
"This is a book review, not a summary, so I won't simply regurgitate the story here.I hadn't heard the comparisons between Girl on the Train and Gone Girl before I read this novel but I can see some resemblance: both have female leads and both have great plot twists. Other than that, they're completely different. I liked the perspective of seeing things from inside a train and how that narrow focus gradually widened until we could see the whole picture. There were a few obvious red herrings but the suspense was maintained throughout. Also, I think the author nailed the behavior of an alcoholic as well as how such behavior has a ripple effect on everyone else. However, the overall character development -- so important for a good story -- was a little thin (I never got a solid mental picture of anyone), but the pacing was fantastic and the plot twists were well done so that's why I gave it four stars."
"If it ever happens again that I consider a Paula Hawkins book, I pray someone shakes me until I come to my senses.Muddled and exhausting. The ramblings of an alcoholic, schizophrenic, nymphomanic?  The story got too sickening to figure it out.  It is hard to believe that so many people bought this book.I believe the comments by A. Grace hit the tack on the cranium. Wish I had read that before I ordered the book."
"While I enjoy a good murder mystery, I also like to have some compassion for at least one character. The writing was good, hence the two stars but I didn't care about any of the characters especially the main one. The only thing I cared about at the end was the money I spent buying this book. Not one character was remotely likable. I wouldn't purchase another book by this author."
Holds attention and keeps you guessing so you HAVE to know what comes next!
"Although I understand the process of jumping around on time frames in this book it seemed a little more bewildering than some others I have read. In fact for the first hundred pages I really had a hard time getting into the story because Rachel was so pathetic that she was hard to even root for. This does not mean she was not a well-developed character nor does it mean the book was poorly written. I simply had a hard time identifying with any of the characters and it may be because the author was attempting to use Rachel's black periods as a device to make you question what really happened. About two-thirds of the way through the book I had determined who I believed killed Megan so the only thing left to do was to see who lived who died and who went to jail. The finale of the book was well done and feel true to form. I appreciate the story and I always enjoy a mystery but this book did not grab me as much as some others I have read recently. I still think many people would really enjoy reading the book and of course it would make a wonderful movie as has already been done. I simply believe that there are other books that do suspense better than this one although this is a fun read and I cannot say I was disappointed by it. Some of it just felt like it had been done before and in some cases better. As you can see I still believe it was a 4 out of 5 and therefore worth the time to read. Pardon the grammar, it is difficult to write a review on your cell phone."
A few people highly recommended this book so I gave it a try. Found the beginning to be very slow and almost stopped reading it. The story eventually got interesting but I never really cared for the main character. Maybe the story will be turned into an interesting movie but I cannot recommend reading the book.
"I heard a lot about this book so I thought I'd check it out. It was better than I thought it would be. I did figure out who the killer is pretty much before the end, but I was watching pretty carefully for the clues. I haven't seen the movie yet, but I don't expect it to be as good as the book."
I bought this book to see what all the fuss was about.  Now I know.  This is a great book!  Giving you just enough information when you need it as you go along is a great way to keep the reader from becoming bored.  Different view points from different characters.  Very well written.  Twisted story.
"I wanted to like this book, and while it was suspenseful, the plot was highly unrealistic.  While I was reading, I kept telling myself there was no way that something like this would happen in real life.  None of the characters are likeable, which is fine, but the major character shifts in two key characters feel contrived and unconvincing.  The shifting connections between all the main characters are not believable either.  The book's strongest element is its setting, reinforced by Rachel's constant train rides.  I'm not why this book came so highly hyped.  It was OK, but I wouldn't read it again, and I certainly wouldn't recommend it to a friend."
I have NO IDEA why this is #1 on the best seller list. It is OK not great. Read this book if you are on vacation or taking a flight and want a book that won't make you think. It's an easy read. None of the characters make you want to care about them or solve the case.
"This book is full of self-doubt, alcoholism and sadness.  I did NOT enjoy this book - kept reading it so that it may materialize into something happier - it really never did.  I'm sorry I wasted my time.  I was so depressed after reading it.  I mentioned I read it on Facebook and everyone commented how sad it was.  Guess that's what the author had in mind ... so, well ... she achieved that."
"It was well written, but excruciatingly boring. The only excitement I felt was when I was finished. I can't imagine why they would make this book into a movie, that would be a total bore.Besides the very end of the book this wasn't very interesting. None of the characters were likable, in fact I hated them all. Not one favorite. Waste of my time."
"I bought this out of curiosity since it is such a huge bestseller. It is just okay, I fail to see anything special in it. I'm not a huge fan of unreliable narrators for one thing. It makes you wonder if you're just wasting time reading stuff that turns out to be untrue. The protagonist, a slobbering drunk with no respect for others' privacy, is thoroughly unlikable until the ending. The London setting would be intriguing if we got to see more of it, it's mostly train tracks and views from a train window. The supporting cast of characters is thinly drawn. We spend way too much time reading about the protag's drunken stupors, and not enough getting to know anyone else. One has to wonder whether all the glittering blurb-it's actually read it, or were just jumping on the underserved hype train."
"This book was worse than a waste of time. Decided to keep reading this inane story due to my own stubborn tendency not to quit books in the middle. My own fault. The protagonist, Rachel, is a complete wing-nut who happens to also be an alcoholic and consciously makes the wrong decision at every opportunity with or without the aid of alcohol. She is impossible to like and her monotonous internal chatter takes up a lot of the story. Sigh. The book is fraught with maddening ""unrealities"", for instance, Rachel survives financially for days and days on a ""tenner"" that her cliche' enabler flatmate, Cathy, loaned her. Really? The enormous plot twist near the end is the kicker that has me writing this review. It was simply ridiculous. I'm left wondering how this book was ever published in the first place, and who are these people giving 4 & 5 star reviews?"
"For some reason, I was expecting a Gone Girl-style twist in this novel but it was more of a slow build to an increasingly obvious conclusion. It was also kind of like the Lifetime movie of novels - there may be an entertaining storyline, but there's nothing brilliant about it, no real themes or moral to the story, no character development of any significance or depth... It just kind of describes a series of events and tries to thrill the reader a bit. Over all, it was worth reading because it held my attention for a week, but I won't likely sing its praises to anyone or recommend it."
"The story was reasonably interesting at first, but the first person narrative for all three women was sometimes tough to distinguish.  Their voices were too similar.  The author also kind of lost me with Anna; she was just so cold and surprisingly shallow compared to the other two. If she's meant to be that way, that's fine, but really she was unbelievable at times.  The big finish/twist was also wrapped too neatly and too quickly.Overall a mediocre, quick read for a lazy day but it will not be totally satisfying. I wish I had spent my money elsewhere."
"Read this novel and really wanted to love it but I couldn't. It's full of very flawed characters (as is life I suppose) and it's very hard to root for anyone, especially the protagonist. I find it difficult to read a book and feel satisfied when you aren't rooting for anyone. I won't give away any spoilers and I will acknowledge that Rachel ( the protagonist) has had a hard time but at a certain point, you have to rise above your circumstances or the bad hand you've been dealt (don't you?). I'll be interested to see how the movie unfolds as the book is a narrative from the view point of  3 different women. Can't recommend the book."
"Obviously this is a very popular book right now. So it was on my to read list. When I got to the mystery or thriller challenge, I wanted to read this.This is a quick paced, easy to read book.I loved the relationships with Rachel and everyone else.Rachel was flawed and yet I was rooting for her. I wanted her to get it together and have a life and find someone to love her. I wanted her to have a family.Most of the way through the book, I was undecided on who did it. A little more than halfway through, I started thinking it was who it turned out to be. Little clues along the way made me begin to wonder about who it really was.I got a little worried for her safety towards the end.All in all, a fast paced, enjoyable read. A great mystery that will leave you questioning who and what all the way through."
"Great suspenseful book. I couldn't put it down.  I don't usually read fiction books; I'm more of a non-fiction and biography reader.  This book was chosen for a book club that I was a member of, so I figured that I better read it so I could be part of the conversation.  I'm so glad that I did because I had a hard time putting this book down.  When I had to put it down to, I couldn't stop thinking about what was going to happen next.  It was a really well written book with great character development.  I wish the ending was a little different (I kinda saw that coming towards the end of the book)."
"This is dark. And it's depressing. And it's really creepy. The characters all have almost unfathomable problems that make your heart break. But once you start reading Paula Hawkins's ""The Girl on the Train,"" all you will want to do is read.This chilling book--combination psychological thriller and who-done-it--tells the story of three women and two men living in the London suburbs and the love, lies and jealousies that break them. Each chapter is told from the first-person point of view of one of the women. The writing is riveting and the plot compelling, and even when you guess ""who done it,"" there are more twists and turns to come.Advice: Take it to the beach or save it for a snow day when you can just give in and read for hours at a time. It's THAT good."
"Finishing this book became a chore for me about half way through.  The ending was dull and I felt that most of the story didn't tie in much.  There are several narratives, all unlikable.  It tries to be a suspense, but I was bored. You could read the first few and last chapters and not be missing much.  I felt like the author was adding fluff to make a short story into a book.  Honestly I feel like it is super overrated and taking a ride on ""Books similar to Gone Girl"" bus."
"The Girl on the Train: A NovelI enjoyed this book! It is written from each character's perspective, one at a time. It conveys how we can each live out the same scenario, yet perceive the events completely differently. The plot unfolds to keep you guessing as to the truth of the actual events and whose perspective is accurate, if any. Although it wasn't one I couldn't put down, I did find myself wanting to make time to sit down and read. I enjoyed this book and would recommend it. If you found this review to be helpful, would you please take a moment to mark it as such. Thanks!"
"I bought this book because people said it was comparable to Gone Girl. It is not. The suspense and buildup are fine but the storytelling is mediocre. Some of the characters were given back stories but these weren't all explained in the story. Gone Girl is so much better than this- the storytelling, the suspense, and the character motives."
"At first I loathed every character. I felt for Rachel experiencing similar events in my life. She made me mad, she made me examine my own life. I've come to understand Rachel and become her champion! I hated Anna, how dare she do what she did? But then you feel for her as a mother, but have a sour taste in your mouth. Oh Megan! I almost feel like we all have a Megan in our lives. You worry for her, judge her, hate her, love her and want to help her. This book hits close to home for me and probably for many more. I couldn't put it down, even when I wanted too."
"This book was selected to be read in my monthly book club. Unlike some book clubs, we actually read the books! I really wanted to like this book but I just found it really difficult to keep the characters straight. I was constantly trying to remind myself who was who and flipping back to previous chapters to make sure I knew which character the author was referring to. This was just not a good book for me. I probably have ADD or ADD tendencies so this book did not help with that at all. I will say that there is a great plot twist at the end - I considered this to be my reward for hanging in there until the end."
"The Girl on the Train was definitely unexpected! The story is told from the points of view of three very different women with one thing in common. None of these three woman are entirely admirable characters. All three have very few redeeming qualities. For the first few chapters it was difficult to feel particularly close to any of them... but it was like driving by a car accident. You know you shouldn't...but you just have to look as you go by.The more I read, the more I had to read on. I subjected anyone who would listen to analyses and theories on who dunnit. Believe me, my accusations evolved rapidly with each turning page... but it wasn't until the last few chapters that the true sinister culprit came forth with clarity and a sense of ""how did I not see this from the start?!""The Girl on the Train was just as, if not more, gripping than Gone Girl."
"Interesting, compelling storyline and definitely held my attention to the end.  The characters and their flaws just kept coming but not in a way that detracted but instead pulled you into the story tighter and tighter.  I must admit to feeling exhausted by the time it ended.I can certainly understand why this book was chosen to become a movie."
The Girl on the Train is a great read.  It took me about a fourth of the way into the story to get into it but once I did I didn't want to put it down.  I started the book on a flight and the return flight just wasn't long enough.  I wanted to keep flying so I could keep reading.  I ended up staying up too late one night to find out how the book would end.  The characters are interesting.  The mood was rather dark.  I like the story told from the viewpoint of each character which seems to be the new trend in writing these days.  I thought I knew how the book would end but I was wrong.  There are lots of twists and turns in the plot and it will keep you guessing. This is the best book I have read in a long time.  When I finished the book I didn't want it to end.  I highly recommend it.  I can't wait for the next book by Paula Hawkins.
"I loved this book, more than I thought I would. Love the multiple narrators with the different perspectives, the swirling revelations that are revealed in an almost rollercoaster fashion. I've missed sleep to read and finish it .that says a lot for me!"
"This sounded good & I had high hopes! It's an ok enough book that it keeps you reading until the end, but it's not a favourite. The main character, Rachel, is so pitiful & self-loathing, it's hard to identify with her. Maybe this is what the author was going for, but I don't think it was done very well. The twist at the end was more disappointing than satisfying. I found the timeline was very difficult to keep track of as it kept bouncing around with each new character chapter - I kept forgetting ""when"" it was & had to go back & check. Overall an ok 1st book to read on my new kindle but not one I'd recommend to someone. Happy I only paid for the kindle edition vs the real book & even then, it's overpriced for what it is. Sorry! Just didn't enjoy it.If you want a good thriller book, try Gone Girl or The Silent Wife - both good reads!"
"""Girl on the Train"" has been on the NY Times bestseller list for so long that I thought it must be a compelling novel.  Wrong.  The premise of the story sounds interesting, but the telling of the story didn't 'grab' me.  Using alcoholic blackouts as a suspense tool was weak, in my opinion.  The main character, Rachel, is so flawed and the situations she finds herself in are just not believable.  Even lab rats learn to alter their behavior with repeated negative stimulus, but not Rachel.  I just couldn't engage with or care about the other characters either.  I usually pass books along to friends, but this one has been sitting on a table for weeks.  I finally realized I don't want to burden anyone else I know with this story, so I'm donating it to a used bookstore."
"At first I thought, oh no, it's Gone Girl set outside of London. That comparison quickly faded as this book is actually better. The flawed main protagonist helps. Actually all the characters are flawed, rendering them both unreliable and sympathetic. This unreliability, drawn up through actual physical reasons for doubt to reasons of lies, emotional distance, and lack of information on a character serves as a constant feed for the tension and its consistent throughout all the diary-like entries.I generally dislike dates as chapter headings. It's just another thing to keep track of and my mind quickly reads over them (hence I forget them straight away) because I hurry right to the ""juicy stuff."" And this book has lots of juicy bits, but the dates ARE important and I made an effort to keep track.5 stars is not quite enough to give this book, I'd say 7-9 was closer out of an imaginary 10."
I started this book a few months ago and put it away. A friend was reading it so I thought I would give it another try. Do not read this book if you're depressed or sad....the whole premise is sick and twisted.  It does depict the sadness and desperation of alcoholism- the total wasting away of someone life. This is not a summer beach read!  I think the author was channeling Gone Girl- no more depressing books for me.
"I thought this would be similar to the Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" but I was wrong. This was a very black and depressing story. The main character was very unlike able and too much of the story was her imagination of events. I had a hard time getting thru the book and eventually decided not to finish reading it. I would not recommend it."
"The characters are under-developed and all seem to have a very similar voice. The use of changing point-of-view just does not really cut it in this book. Each character is fairly flat and about two thrids through the book, I was able to figure out ""who done it."" Or at least ""who probably done it."" I'm still glad I read it, to see what all the buzz is about, and to experience a serious writer's foray into contemporary fiction. This is not great literature; not a terribly deep story, and certainly not on par with Hitchkock thrillers. The writing is straightforward and this is a quick read; almost a page turner. Ok, I admit I turned the page rather quickly. I'd like to add that I'm rooting for Paula Hawkins as a fiction writer, in spite of my tepid review. She is smart and amazing. We will be seeing more great stuff from her."
"Interesting style but used to the point of the story being over-written, over complicated, and self indulgent."
"I couldn't put this one down - I stayed up all night reading this book it was completely engrossing. The characters were FULL of surprises, the plot took many turns, and I genuinely cared what happened to the heroine, even though she is extremely complicated. This was well done and the best thriller I've read since Gone Girl. It's hard for an author to have character this complex be so captivating and likeable, but Paula Hawkins pulled it off. It's like when a movie star is able to play a villain that you both loathe and like. It's tough but fascinating, just like this book!"
"I read this for a book club at work. It's a slow starter, let me just say. The entire set up on the story involves a lot of introspective internal monologue by the main character, drinking on the train and miserable about something, but you don't find out too much for what seemed like the first quarter of the book. It is good at the end and I'm not sorry I read it. The last quarter of story picks up speed, has twists and generally makes up for the slow start.Also, it's not linear. It jumps from the point of view of one female character to the next and then back. It takes a little getting used to, but the characters have a fairly distinct voices, so it gets easier to follow as you go.I chose Dark as the mood for this book, because it is a murder mystery. More along the lines of Gone Girl."
"For a debut novel, you would never know this author had not written before. It is absolutely absorbing, I couldn't put it down.It starts with Rachel riding the train past the house she lived in with her ex who now lives there with his new wife. Also a couple of houses down she observes a loving couple and every day she looks up and watches as the train passes.She makes up names for the loving couple and wonders if she could ever have that kind of love again.This story quickly twists and turns. It is not a romance. Rachel ends up far deeper in the lives of the people in both houses than you expect.I found this book to be gripping and could not wait for the result. This book to me, is book shelf worthy, my only regret is that I purchased it on my kindle. I will watch for this author again. If she could come up with this, what else does she have to tell?"
"I forced myself to read the whole book.  Rachel was a weak baby, and I wanted to shake her and say, ""grow up"".  Talk about blind to anything around her.  Megan was a weak nympho.  It was a book that left you dissatisfied."
"If I had to describe this book in two words, it would be: cheap fiction. The book is mostly written from the perspective of a unreliable, despondent alcoholic mess of a human being. The prose was therefore equally unpolished, lazy, and uninspired. The story itself was somewhat suspenseful -- hence two stars instead of one -- but the resolution unfolds so quickly at the end that it makes you realize that the other 90% of the book was excess junk. Sadly this story could have been told in 30 pages."
"I got confused with the alternating of persons.  I felt like I had to force myself to finish the book.  The end tied everything together with a surprise ending, perhaps the best part of the book.  I bought this book because my daughter wanted to read it because it is on the list of best sellers.  Now that I have finished I told her to be aware that there are 3 different women telling their story and to keep that in mind as you read the book.  Perhaps if I would have been aware of this, I would have rated the book differently.  The women in the story were not ""strong"" women that you would want your daughters to follow as role models.  They each had their issues and in my opinion, set back the way women are viewed and treated."
"This book was very hard to get into as it begins a bit oddly so I put it away to read something else.  Then I saw a trailer for the upcoming movie and I thought that looks good so maybe I will try once more to read the book.  I did go back to it, stuck with it, and once the other characters who narrate the story get involved in telling their side of the story, it all made sense and became a good read to the point that I had to find out who committed the dastardly deed.  I was surprised at the ending.  Stick with it; I think you will be glad you did."
The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins is a psychological thriller.  Rachael Watson is the Girl on the Train and she is the main character.  Through her train trips we meet the other characters ; Tom (her ex-husband) and his new wife Anna and Scott and Megan.  These two couples are neighbors on the same street.  The first part of the novel rolls along rhythmically like the train on the tracks.  Once the crime has been committed the tension mounts and everyone becomes a suspect.  The mental illnesses run rampant is this novel and everyone seemingly has their own little corner on mental health. The most normal character in the story was Cathy Rachael's roommate.  I found myself comparing this to Gone Girl and The Rear Window.
"Before the end of the book, I had figured out who the killer was, but it had taken me a while.  But even knowing that did not diminish the suspense in this book because I couldn't anticipate how it was going to play out.  I am not going to summarize the plot, but this book was different than anything that I have read, and I read a lot of police procedurals and murder mysteries.  I was intrigued by the blurbs about how the story was about a girl who viewed things from a train; when I am a passenger, I like to look in houses that I am passing and imagine what is happening.  What follows is plausible.  I took me a while to warm up to Rachel, and I can't say that I really liked any of the characters by the end of the novel, but there aren't too many books that I can't wait to get back to.  This was one."
"I like to believe what I read even if it is fiction.  It was hard to believe there could be real people with so much emotional damage as the characters in the novel.  Unfortunately, the nightly news reminds us there are.  The story is like a cork-screw with many twists and turns right up to the final pages which ends like a thrilling movie rather than insightful literature.  However, this seems to be the direction of novels of various genre the last few years which makes me feel some authors are writing with an eye on the big screen.  As a psychological crime novel without an obvious detective and several suspects, it kept me guessing and I rated it as ""good"".  Be careful out there: reality may be stranger than fiction."
"It is both frustrating and enticing to see Rachel's efforts to remember that fateful night. The night she was drunk (again) and a woman disappeared. Rachel meddles with the investigation... sort of... because she liked to watch the woman and her husband from her seat on the London train. Although a couple of houses away live her ex-husband and his new wife and baby, and she kind of stalks them, too. So much sorrow and confusion...I thought the novel was brilliant in depicting an alcoholic's struggle, on top of the ""whodunnit"" story itself. Rachel is both creepy and pitiable. As much of a ""loser hero"" as she was, I found myself rooting for her.My only disappointment came at the end, which was way too drawn-out and gore for my taste. Once we know who's done it, please, wrap it up. Otherwise a really good thriller."
"I've read other excellent reviewers who found the changes in POV and changes in time confusing, but for me they worked quite well.  In fact, the story and the suspense wouldn't have worked without these jumps and I very much liked trying to figure out who thought what when.  All 3 female characters (the 3 POVs) have their perspectives, their differences, and their psychological limitations, so being inside each separately adds to the plots tension.  It's hard to believe that this is a first novel by Paula Hawkins and I look forward to her next.  The Girl on the Train is a fast read and I recommend it highly."
"I'm giving this book one star because of the ending -- which disappoints on so many levels. My method of reading this was a Kindle, so I'd say the book was an absolute fantastic page-turner until about 85%. Then I started getting a picture of how the book would end. I'll deliver no spoilers. Let's just say, by book's end I thought all of the three women principal characters were pretty much idiots. And all so conveniently in the same London neighborhood! Sorry, I don't feel sympathetic towards them. Morever, it's a bit of a male-bashing plot. A bad ending, in my opinion, negates what comes before it.I want my ten hours back!!!!"
"I really enjoyed reading ""The Girl on the Train"".  The characters were interesting to learn about and the story was very different.  I enjoyed seeing life through the eyes of the Rachel and the other main characters.  Rachel made me feel what she was feeling and I was interested to see what happens next.  The book was shocking, but thrilling to read.  I like that the author tells the story from more than one perspective, but the main focus is on Rachel. I got to understand her better as the book went on and you can't help but feel pity for her when you learn why she ended up a binge drinker.  I like the way she sees life through the window of the train.  I can relate to how she felt.  The book was a page turner from beginning to end and it was well written. I would recommend it because I enjoyed it and it was also a unique story."
"THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is told from the first person point of view by Rachel, who imagines fantasy lives for people living in homes that she passes on the train. Living a restricted life, her daily train rides disguise that she has been fired from her job. As a heroine, Rachel is not particularly likeable. She has low self-esteem and is frequently so drunk that she has memory lapses, with one such lapse serving as a primary focal point.  Personally, the constant inebriation was overdone. Other characters, particularly the male ones, are similarly unlikeable. And when Rachel injects herself into the lives of those who had been fantasy characters, it's a bit much to accept. No doubt, this novel has become popular because of Ms. Hawkins' skill at slowly unraveling the many layers of this novel's central mystery: What happened to Megan?"
I ordered the book for a friend and took it out of the library for my self.  My friend loves mysterys.  I had a hard time getting trough it.  I don't know why it is on best seller lists.  I returned the book for her and another I ordered from Amazon called Headstrong.  She had a PHD in biochemistry.
"I'm usually not into thrillers. I lean more towards historical fiction but I couldn't put this one down! At first I bought just the Kindle version but I soon added the audio version for my car. It is very well-written. Even though several women are narrating at different times, it is easy to follow along and know who is speaking. This is especially important on the audio version. I was never confused about who was narrating. I highly recommend reading the book before watching the movie (which is also good but in a different way)."
"I read the whole thing because it was my book club's monthly choice.  The first negative is that the names and characters were very confusing and difficult to keep track of who's who.  This clarified after the first several chapters.  The second negative is that I didn't like the main character at all.  She was such a wimp and complainer!  I don't like being around negative, complaining people, so reading a book full of ""poor me"" was not fun or entertaining.  I also figured out ""who done it"" rather quickly, so it wasn't much of a thriller.  The writing was average, so I didn't have to suffer through poor sentence structure or grammatical errors.  I wish I had borrowed it from the library rather than spending money on it.  I deleted it from my tablet immediately after the book club meeting."
"The book was recommended to me by a respected friend.I feel I should have downloaded the sample first.I found the author's style to be repetitious and confusing as the principle in the book started off by deceitful behaviour in order to conceal that she no longer was employed, but continued to a daily routine involving the train to and from her point of previous employment.She then continued her downward spiral through a series of actions involving what amounted to voyeurism, then alcohol dependency, to infidelity and finally involvement in a murder.This is not the kind of book that I would endorse."
"If you are looking for a page-turner of a mystery, this is for you.  The protagonist, Rachel, has plenty of problems- out of work, divorced and alcoholic- and she rides a train every day to keep up the appearance that she has a job for her room mate, Cathy.  She watches a couple she does not know every day but sees their happiness and longs to experience the happiness she once knew.  But then the woman she watches disappears after a night where she was drunk and in the area and she cannot remember what happened.  The list of suspects grows and you can not be sure what happened as the layers of the characters are peeled back, one by one.  This is an intense psychological thriller that will keep you turning the pages for more."
"At this moment in time newbie authors are trying to jump on the bandwagon so they can get ""The Next Gone Girl"" blurb on their book cover. (While I loathed Gone Girl and wished every character to die die die, I would be a fool not to acknowledge the success of the book.)  Paula Hawkins' novel is the story of two hot messes and how their lives intersect even though technically they never meet. Well, lets be honest: everyone in this book is a hot mess and even after the climax of the story I believe they will continue on their individual downward spirals. But I was more entertained, was more interested in how everything would be resolved, and had a better time reading this Girl than I did That Which Shall Be Forgotten."
"With all the hype 'The Girl on the Train' had been getting, I wasn't quite sure if it would be something I'd enjoy. Generally I tend to steer away from huge blockbuster books as they are a little more ""safe"" than what I usually enjoy reading. Lucky for me, I decided to see what all the fuss was about, and was sucked into this book from the very beginning. One of the best ""page-turner"" thrillers I've read in quite some time, 'The Girl on the Train' is a fantastic psychological work. Not only a thrilling read, but also a smart one that makes you question how much you might really know about someone - even after you think you know it all."
"I read The Girl on the Train in one weekend after seeing a preview of the upcoming movie. It looked intriguing so I bought it. The character development is good but not too much to bore you and the story moves quickly. There are definitely some twists and turns as the plot is told through the perspectives of three different women, but I was able to figure out ""who done it"" about a third of the way into the book. That didn't completely ruin it for me because I still wanted to see how things would play out in the end. It's not serious reading but it is entertaining."
"I found this book tedious in the extreme.  Not fast-paced, not a thriller.  The characters weren't relatable, they were boring.  The alcoholism was grating, and far too repetitively convenient as a plot point.  I'm giving it two stars because the writing was decent -- not compelling, but Ms. Hawkins knows how to put sentences together and has a decent command of grammar, a skill not shared by a lot of current authors.  Her plotting is another matter. The overall plot wasn't bad, but along the lines of what another reviewer wrote, instead of putting the effort required into writing a truly engaging story with unfolding events, the author just had her narrators withhold detail so she could have a series of plot twists.  I knew who the killer was halfway through the book.  The final twist was the most satisfying, but it was an effort to finish the book to get to it."
"I've never wanted to bitch slap a story character so badly and i don't believe in violence.  I was rooting for Rachel but she was a hot mess.  Is it possible for a person to be that herp derp?  I cringed at her repeated socially awkward behavior and situations she put herself in.  Yes we have all been fools for love but Rachel groveled to new depths.  I am not familar with severe alcoholism but her constant blackouts became annoying.  I was hoping Rachel would adopt some real detective skills and her mission would inspire her to grow a spine but that never materialized.  The foundation of the story is enticing and I kept thinking any minute it was going to kick into overdrive, instead the book stayed in third grear grinding to a petered out finale."
"I got this book to satisfy my need for another Gone Girl –type of thriller to read with my mother this summer. This fit the bill.  I’m usually the type of person who can’t predict an ending in a mystery and I’m almost always surprised with where it goes. Not so with this book. The plot is not too complicated, so it’s perfect for laid-back summer brain where you might not be completely engaged every time you pick up the book. Prepare yourself for a main character that you will not like. This makes the story itself shine more than the main character, which is a very interesting. Also, the main idea of the story – witnessing something on a train and then inserting oneself into the drama is a great premise. Overall, a good book and a great summer read."
"If you like Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window and other psychological thrillers in that genre, then you'll probably love The Girl on the Train. This is an excellent and superbly written book, amazing for a first novel.But I didn't particularly like Rear Window (more boring than suspenseful, I thought), and I found it a bit hard to get through this book for the same reasons. Despite excellent writing and a great story, it moved so glacially slowly that I got bored and disinterested. Personally I'm more a fan of action thrillers, and this just had too many long stretches of nothing.Still, it's a great book for those that like long-simmering suspense; so I rate it as 4 stars as a compromise between 5-star writing and 3-star interest for me."
"I started reading this book on an airplane; LaGuardia to El Paso. I was 80 percent finished by the time I arrived in Texas. I could not put it down. I vaguely recall airline crew talking to me: In case ofemergency...do you want something to drink...etc. I, however, was not flying on a plane but was instead, riding in a train. Thank you for this addicting read."
"Did not like this book. Best seller?  Felt kind of duped or suckered.  Found the pace dull, slow and many of the points repeated over and over.  Not really suspenseful, with an end set of events that held no surprise.  Reading a book were I do not like any of the characters and find their motivations so shallow and petty is not fun, enlightening or a good read.  Don't get me wrong, characters need flaws and personality complexity to bring a story to life.  But to paraphrase Dean Wormser ""Son, fat, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life.""  It does not make a good main character either."
"This book reminded me of the classic ""Rebecca"" with the irreliable narration and tormented protagonist, except honestly this story was a bit more of a page turner, but this is mostly due to a style of writing more suited to a modern audience.If you are someone who has suffered abuse or suffer depression, this book is likely to be a trigger and may have a bad effect on you. Most reviewers don't think of such things.This was a very good book and I highly recommend it, I'm not one to go on analyzing a book. Let just say it will have an emotion impact on you. If you like your protagonists to be loveable and larger than life, you won't like this book, it is dark and perhaps just a little to ""real."" I see it compared to ""Gone Girl, and I get the similarity, this one requires much less suspension of disbelief."
"The previous reviewers who remarked that the voices of the three narrators/women were wholly interchangeable hit the proverbial nail on the head! That and the fact that there was no real nuance or dimension to any of the characters to begin with are the biggest disappointments about this novel. Maybe the latter is the reason there were no real distinguishing features between any of them other than their circumstances so it is really the same problem. And the characters were not believable or likable. I did, however, from time to time find myself rooting for Rachel despite her propensity for excessive apologizing and her pathetic behavior and life, and I found the story/plot itself was still a relatively engaging whodunit so I gave it three stars overall. Just don't expect it to move you in any way.  Profound this novel is not."
"This was one of those books that is hard to review. All of the characters were horrible people, not a likable person in the bunch. But yet there were times I could not put it down, wondering what would  happen next.  Would I recommend it?  I'm not sure. It was different, but somewhat akin to Gone Girl. If you read that book, you will know what I mean about unlikable characters. A bit of a ""train wreck"" pun intended, several bad marriages, a drunk you just want to slap sometimes, mental abuse, it's got all that! If you like dysfunctional people, this book might just be for you."
"Great suspense story, slightly better than the movie.  It is now a movie which I found a little confusing on the characters.  I believe the book helps clarify the ambigusness."
"Yet another version of an inexplicably popular genre: poorly written books about awful people who do awful things to each other because they're too shallow and too bored to think of anything better to do with their time. Girl on the Train, Gold Finch, Gone Girl, Go Set a Watchman. Why do all these train wrecks start with the letter G? Not because they're good or worth your time to read. Why these books are sometimes grouped with Anthony Doerr's All the Light We Cannot See is beyond me, since Doerr always writes beautifully about worthwhile people and subjects. Kindle keeps recommending books like this for me, I guess because I keep reading them. Addicting, like the booze their protagonists often over consume. No worries, though. Tomorrow I'm going to quit."
"I enjoyed this book because it brought to mind things I've thought about while looking out of a train window while going to school overseas for two years.  The route was the same twice daily so I saw the same buildings and  people and wondered about their lives.  It's the same  familiarity with a neighborhood you get if you walk a dog along the same path.  You start to make assumptions about the people you see, imagine their life stories,weave scenarios in your mind, and then find out the rich people in the mansion can't afford furniture, the slender woman is bulimic, and the pleasant man kicks his dog.  This is a really good premise for a story.  I wish I hadn't realized quite early who would actually have done what, but I've read a lot of mysteries.  This book had believable and interesting characters. It was all in all a very good read."
"I loved this book and read it in about 3 days.  I thought the characters were compelling, albeit self-absorbed and difficult to like at times. I was drawn in by the first few paragraphs and how sad and dejected Rachel was, but I kept going because I really wanted to figure out what happened to Megan and to see if Rachel finds some peace.  The only flaw with this novel, in my opinion, is the 3 main characters' preoccupation with husbands, babies, and reproduction.  All of their lives, and personalities, revolve around men and babies, and they all seemed in competition with each other over who has the most idyllic family life.  It struck me as an archaic, artificial basis for their actions, which gave the whole novel an almost sexist feel to it.  Having said that, the novel is entertaining and seductive and I would definitely recommend it."
"The Girl on the trainI was a little confused at the beginning of this intriguing story, but once I was able to identify each individual character the way the author had intended to portray them I was on a roll.As the story begins to unfold and the secrets,  lies and deceptions come to light through this well written storyline it became impossible to put the book down.I was totally captured in the whole thrilling,  captivating suspense, the twists turns right to the very end, and once you begin to understand each individual character you will then be totally hooked as the story unfolds and the killer is revealed.Definitely worth the read.Loved it Paula, nice work."
"You NEED to read this before the movie comes out.  The pace is steady; page after page the story develops until you get to the top and realize that what you thought about a character was completely off.  Truly well written.  I'm a suspense kind of gal, so I'm a fan of Paula Hawkins.  I'm looking forward to the movie yet still always believe that the books are better than the movies.  You cannot capture thoughts, emotions, and scenes in movies as well as you can within your own imagination.  I will not give details into the plot.  You must simply read it."
"So glad these women didn't continue as pathetic victims. The unfolding of truth was well done. Anna was triumphant mad creepy at same time. She might be the character I would most likely to see if cashed in movie. Megan was so well scripted out... Sounded borderline personality or bipolar. Well done. The doctor ... Story of her past had so much potential for a thriller in itself. Great characters ... Lushes, cheats, narcissists. I didn't feel sorry for people too long which was a nice reprieve. Everyone was good and evil; except baby. Not sure if murderer was anything but a pathological liar gone socio path. Not a lot of good underneath it all. Liked it very much. Will miss no one though. Never want to see anyone again because it would be a nightmare that you would want to wake up from. Scary women.  Scary men. Evie has a legacy now."
"Good opening, entices the reader into the story.  The three person narratives at times became confusing, especially if the reader put down the book and did not read it straight through, since there certain similarities in the character's traits. The author made good use of an ordinary circumstance of daily train riding to bring home a lot of good points.  The train is a metaphor for the lives of the three women in varying stages of decision making; Rachel caught in between life and destruction, Anna craving to move and Meghan who actually does make a move. I found their stories so intertwined for a while I thought they might be one woman with three personalities. I found the ending justified and was glad the author indicated the forward movement of the remaining characters. A good, light summer read."
"This book is so easy to read that before I knew it I had read for hours!! I wanted to gobble it down as fast as I could. The main character is an emotional mess and it can feel depressing in places, but keep reading! Written as stream of consciousness, you learn plenty about the characters consistently throughout the book.  There is a lot to know and the story opens like a rose, revealing the confusion, tension and mystery of the plot. It keeps you guessing who the victim will be, and then who the murderer is! Terrific ending!!"
"I loved this book from start to finish.  And I also loved how it was written - in the ""First Person"", but by three different people, but also each narrator follows a slightly different timeline.  The main narrator is Rachel with Megan also narrating a good part of the book and finally Anna who plays just a minor role in the narration.  Megan's story is a few weeks behind Rachel's.The story is excellent with a great twist at the end.  It is very well written and the characters, who you get to know in a very gradual way, are very believable.  The story, and writing style, gripped me from the very beginning and kept my interest right up to the end.If this is Paula Hawkins' first book then I cannot wait for her second one."
"The story was told in somewhat confusing narration. It was very hard to care for the main character and about three quarters into the plot, it was clear who was the killer. It was very hard to care for the people, they seem flat and one dimensional. The writing was OK, but lacked the ability to grab your attention fully as it was jumping from person to person with no seeming connection and the story felt like it was not developed with neither."
I could not put this book down once I started. (I read it in a few days -- that's how good it is!) It is full of twists and turns. I love that each chapter is narrated by a different character. It was a bit of an easy read for me but still kept me on the edge of my seat. Every chapter I would change my mind on who I thought the killer was.I would definitely recommend to those that love a good thriller. Can't wait for the movie!
"It's no ""War and Peace"" but The Girl on the Train was perfect for me to read on a long trip.  The plot offers some insight on how much anyone can really know about another person, especially if there are drugs and alcohol involved.  The heroine, who is battling her own demons, observes certain behaviours and comes to conclusions about them.  The truth is not always as simple as it seems, however, and jumping to conclusions without knowing the whole story is never a good idea.  The book is about how she finally makes sense of nonsense."
"I really wanted to love this book.  The premise was so intriguing....girl riding on the train inventing lives for the occupants of the houses she passes every day.  As the story unfolds about the girl on the trains past relationship with these houses I felt a little set up.  Some of the twists were true twists and the identity of the ""bad guy"" was initially surprising.  If this book had ended differently I would have had a better reading experience but it stepped into a very unbelievable set of behaviors that sapped the energy from the book.  The Girl on the Trains character was not as developed as it could have been.  I did enjoy the different voices the story was told from as we got to know more about the characters."
"I don't understand how this could be compared to Gone Girl.  ALL of the characters were unlikable, the story dragged on, and the ending was predictable. Don't waste your time. I gave it two stars only because I actually finished the book."
"This was highly touted and I did like it, listening to the Audible version on my morning walks. It was well narrated. At first it was hard to care about this young woman who had totally lost her sense of self respect and was basically a desperate drunk. But as the story unfolded and she observes a couple in the house down the street from where she used to live, she fantasizes about their life as she fakes going to work on the train to the city. She is living with a friend since her husband left her but doesn't want her to know she has lost her job.I was involved in the characters and felt sorry for this pathetic woman who can't seem to face reality and get her life together. I would recommend book. It does twist toward the end."
"The main character constantly enters into situations with no plan about what she is going to say or do.  It was very tiring reading over and over again, ""I know I shouldn't do this, but...."" and off she goes.  It was sad reading about someone with no self esteem and always so drunk she couldn't remember what she had done."
"It's hard to argue with the success of this book--millions of copies sold in several languages, a movie deal, and almost 44K Amazon reviews, so far. The story kept me hooked, and the author's storytelling was fresh and original, with characters whose personalities were revealed a layer at a time. I will say the pacing dragged a bit in the beginning, but once the story got going, I continued to read until the end. I felt empathy for the flawed protagonist, Rachel, who has been beaten down by life and finds it hard to cope. Not everyone finds life easy to navigate, and I rooted for Rachel to the last page."
"This story of The Girl on the Train is on suspenseful and adventurous ride. Turning this way, then that way; Hills and valleys. You think you have the perfect glimpse of a suspect only to be thwarted by another dark tunnel or turn. The perfect mystery."
"If Eric Bentley was right, and melodrama is fueled by the amount of fear it generates, then this is a successful melodrama. These women are all but literally tied to the train tracks in their shared London neighborhood. Their relationships are sharply rendered but shallow; there is betrayal, hand-wringing, abandonment, posturing villainy, and pathological obsession with all things superficial--body shape, real estate, reproductive success, chemical vice, and sexual virtue. Infidelity and sexual adventurism remain punishable by death (for women only). This story's twists and characterizations are so broad and archetypical that it could be told in pantomime. Luckily for us, it's told in really excellent prose; Paula Hawkins has a lot of fun with this problematic potboiler, and so did I."
"Many have compared this novel favorably to ""Gone Girl"" and I can see why - both share an unreliable narration (three narrators in total) and unreliable spouses, too. Key details are effortlessly omitted until they play a major role in the ending (e.g., certain facts that were never explained turn out to be very important). While the novel starts a bit slowly, the second half moves along much better as the story is tighter and increasingly suspenseful.Hawkins' writing is terrific - almost cinematic - and her portrayal of the sad alcoholic Rachel Watson is, as Stephen King tweeted, ""dead perfect.""A recommended read."
"I had previously read ""Gone Girl"" as a book recommended to me by a friend.  Liked the book but didn't think it was anything ""great"".  The Girl On the Train is great!!  Admittedly, I can be a bit of a snob when it comes to books.  I have ""divorced"" more than one book before reading even twenty pages - live is too short and there are too many truly good books to read.  An interesting and unpredictable plot is no longer enough to satisfy me as a reader.  I need smart writing and, frankly, a vocabulary that challenges me without being tedious.  The Girl On the Train is all of that and more - suspenseful with a unique storyline and human.  I have given it my highest endorsement - recommending it to my friends.  Waiting to hear more from you, Paula Hawkins."
I purchased this book for a book club I joined and needless to say I finished it before the set date we were to discuss it. This story kept my attention from beginning to end. I loved how the story is told from the three women perspectives so you gain a full understanding of how they are connected. For a while I had a couple people in mind as the murders when I got closer to the end and realized neither of the people I suspected to be the murderer I was quite surprised. I read a couple reviews stating that they expected the story to end the way it did but I beg to differ. I didn't feel like this was a typical story of love and betrayal. If you do decide to read this book I honestly don't think you will be disappointed because I certainly wasn't.
"I read this right on the heels of another multiple-perspective suspense novel.  While the first one felt very flat, this story seemed to pop to life from the very beginning, and while the characters in the other book were boring, these were interesting.  Just when you think you knew something about them, they were still able to pull off a surprise or two.  While the overall tone is not comedic, there were occasional moments that made me laugh out loud.  I enjoyed getting into their minds.  The other thing I enjoyed about this book is that I could really visualize very vividly what was going on, and I kept feeling like this could easily be adapted as a film.  I look forward to reading more from Paula Hawkins!"
"The story compelled me into reading at any interval I could justify so that I could get to the end.  It dragged for me in the very beginning with the extensive description of Rachel's alcoholic behaviors.  It did set it up well, however, for the way through the rest of the story.It is a good psycho-thriller."
At first I found the book a bit difficult to follow because it jumped from character to character and dates kept changing with the change of characters. I quickly realized I had to pay attention to which character and what the date was when going to a new chapter.  But I found the book intriguing from the first page. I couldn't put it down. Well written - - a great mystery.
I started reading this book a few years back and I left it on the 3 or 4th chapter. When I saw that they made a movie of it. I decided to give it another try. I immediately remembered why I started reading it and I couldn't put it down. I wanted to unveil the secret and get to the bottom of everything. The book leads you one way and then it takes you another. Buy what I found most profound is the description of alcoholism and what people really go through. I really felt dizzy and frustrated and angry and Rachel at times. It was a very good book and I can't wait for the movie!
This is just not my kind of book.  I prefer they Clancy type books. However with ll the hope and the new movie I thought. I would raid it.  A long story abut crazy chicks is not for me.  I figured our who killed Megan about mid-way though the book.  It droned on and on until the last few chapters.
"At first this book was confusing as could be.  I finally figured out that the author is jumping from two different characters - both written in First Person.  Then I re-started the book.  And as it progressed, a third character was also added - written in First Person.It is a great story - had me guessing right up to the very end."
"<<possible spoiler-ish info, so use caution>>Paula Hawkins' debut novel hooks you pretty quickly.Rachel Watson takes the same train to and from her suburban London home every day. She has grown accustomed to the people on the train, and the things the train passes along its route, especially a set of houses set back from the tracks. Most days the train stops at a signal which allows her to observe the people in those houses, and she imagines they are living happier lives than she is. She often sees one attractive couple, whom she's named Jason and Jess, and she's invented careers for them, and feels so good about their relationship.One day, what she sees from her seat on the train shocks her. ""Jess"" is kissing another man! How could she jeopardize the perfect relationship that she and ""Jason"" have? Rachel is devastated and angry, since her own life is in a shambles, and she has idealized this couple she doesn't know. And when ""Jess,"" whose real name is Megan, disappears the next day, Rachel is shocked—and feels that she needs to tell the police what she saw. Little by little, she gets more involved in the investigation about what happened to Megan, because she wants to do her part, and she feels that she knows something.The thing is, though, Rachel isn't entirely reliable. She has a bit of a drinking problem—well, a big drinking problem. And sometimes she has trouble remembering what happens when she drinks. But she has this feeling she might have seen what happened to Megan. If only she could remember...""I have lost control over everything, even the places in my head.""The Girl on the Train is the story of a woman who feels as if life has tossed her out, and she cannot regain her momentum. She is desperate to feel needed, to feel wanted, included again, so when she sees an opportunity to try and help out with the investigation into Megan's disappearance she jumps at the chance. But she doesn't count on her own lies and inadequacies being revealed, or being forced to confront her own issues.Hawkins is a terrific writer and has written a taut, compelling book, despite the fact that many of its characters are pretty unlikeable. The book is told from multiple perspectives—Rachel, Megan, and Anna, Rachel's ex-husband's new wife. I found my mind spinning with all of the different possibilities of what happened, and what was going to happen. I came up with outlandish theories, theories that seemed they had merit, and one I hoped wouldn't be the case.Then sadly, in my mind, Hawkins punted. She took the easy way out, and it honestly killed the book for me. I don't think I'm smarter than many people, although I guess I read a lot of thrillers, but I totally saw the ending coming. I was truly disappointed.I'd definitely encourage you to read this book and formulate your own opinions. So many people have absolutely loved it in its entirety, and been shocked by the way everything transpires, so perhaps you will as well. I think for the most part, this is a pretty great book, and I look forward to seeing what comes next in Hawkins' career."
"Truly, one of the worst books I've read in years. Though it tries to be suspenseful, it is simply chaotic – yet fashionably predictable. The writing leaves a lot to be desired. I'm sure the film will be different, but I simply cannot recommend this book. It took a lot of will to finish it."
This is what you call a true novel. I loved the way the writer took time to build up the scenes. The writer also used the pen with the plot to make you think as well as talking about more in each scene. The writer makes you feel like you are in the scene and in the mind of the character.
"I got 60% of the way through the book and had to look up the ending on Wikipedia because I couldn't read anymore. The characters are incredibly unlikeable. Rachel, the main narrator makes terrible dicisions again and again even though she is fully aware that they terrible. 90% of what I read was Rachel being drunk when she was trying to be sober and harassing people."
"Well written novel about a neighborhood in the London suburbs near a train where a murder takes place, and how the murderer is in plain sight, but not discovered until the end of the story.  The story is told from 3 different women's perspectives, even the one who is eventually murdered."
"The early reviews were right. Pick this thriller up and be prepared to plunge into its world of overlapping characters, well-placed red herrings and enough female angst to fill a shrink's office. Paula Hawkins' complex thriller is the book ""Gone Girl"" wanted to be but wasn't. (Sorry  ""Gone Girl"" fans.) Its heroine's alcohol addiction fuels her obsession with a house she passes daily on a train commute to London. Hawkins never quite lets us know if someone is heading for harm or salvation, and the imbalance is thrilling. Divided among three female characters, the chapters take the reader to the edge of one of two things - a purging reality or the embrace of unspeakable danger. Un-put-downable."
"A real ""who done it"" story. The author draws you into each of the woman's lives then twist and turns them around. Not sure who is responsible for the outcome of the story, all lives interact with one another. Because this happened then this happens but wait.... Because what was witnessed while on the train rolling past..... All intertwined. This is a very good murder mystery book.I probably should give this a five star but I hated the gruesome ending. It was the right ending....I just don't like violence.  I usually stay away from murder mysteries but it was our book club pick for the month. I am glad we picked it.I don't think I will ever get drunk ( not that I ever have but I will never contemplate it now) after reading this one!"
"Took me about a day of reading to get through, and not that i expected the ending exactly  just due to the cues not being very present but i knew something big was going to shift. I feel like the book should have been two in a series because the cast completely shifted in the last chapters.I will say that it was evoking how accurate Rachel's narriations on alcoholism were.Won't be reading again but probably will go see the movie soon, but not on opening weekend to avoid the seburban housewives who read this in their book club."
"Every book today is compared to Gone Girl. Its the New Gone Girl,the Newer Gone Girl,  the Newest Gone Girl. So for those of you expecting a Gone Girl Repeat, this book will disappoint you.  I for one did not love Gone Girl.  However, as The Girl on the Train has amassed 10,000 plus reviews on Amazon, it has just as much hype as Gone Girl.  Train's premise is fun especially for those of us who enjoy peering in people's houses  and lives unobserved from the window of a train or car but  the execution is amateur. Still it is a compelling read.  Rachel is a fun character, a total loser who has kind of accepted her rejected, drunken status and doesn't seem to get to rattled about anything.  Won't take too much figuring out to guess who the killer is in this book but all the same, its a pleasant way to pass a few hours."
"While this was a  most interesting and entertaining book, and It occupied my thoughts when I put it down, I find I can not give it the four or five stars it would otherwise get from me because the voices of the three main women were too similar. I often had to refer to the name at the beginning of the chapter to see who it was about, or read deeply enough into the story to get the gist. There were no individual telltale words or patterns of expression to tell which one the chapter was supposedly written by. Voice is the only major problem I see."
"There's a good reason this is coming out in movie format.  It's GREAT!  Kind of made me feel engrossed in the same way ""Gone Girl"" did.  I had to keep checking the time line to keep things straight in my head.  I'll be interested to see how the movie works with that.  Let your imagination take you through the visuals your mind creates before watching Emily Blunt create a whole different picture.  I'm sure the buzz about the movie is right and this will be a winner.  How could it not be with that woman acting the starring role in a story this dark?"
"I love to read a book before hi see a movie when I can.  You know the book is always better, but I actually look forward to the changes.  Seeing how they pictured the characters compared to me.I think it took a little while for the book to pick up and for me to get use to the back and forth between characters, but by the end I was looking forward to the end of one person's point of view so I could read the others and compare.I like that I didn't put it all together early on.  I was surprised when I knew who did it."
"I read this book in a couple of days and enjoyed it.  I thought it was well written and I liked how each chapter was from a different character's point of view.  None of the characters were that likable, but then, who is?  :)But seriously, the main character was weak and did some pretty foolish things.  However, this made her interesting and you never knew what she was going to do next.  I do wish that she'd ended up being stronger after all she'd gone through, but she was still running away from things and afraid in the end.  I'd recommend this book as a fun, suspenseful and easy read."
"Ugh. This book reminded me so much of Gone Girl. I think I'm one of the only people I know that hasn't liked either. Both of them I did finish because I wanted to know how they ended. This book was a little more satisfying at the end, but not by much. I found myself not LIKING any of the characters. I couldn't pull for anyone, because they were all so unlikable. In the beginning, the main character makes up stories about strangers she sees regularly. Who with an imagination hasn't done that? After that, the story becomes rather far fetched. If you're bored and need something to read because you've read all the books by your favorite authors, then try this. Otherwise, there are many better bets out there. I just finished What She Left Behind. Loved that!"
"Sure the plot devices of this novel are a little silly and far-fetched. Sure the main character gets asked to specific locations because the story requires it in order for the plot to continue. Sure the ending deserves a couple of eye-rolls.But who cares? The central mystery of the novel is compelling enough to make you HAVE to know how it ends. I read the entire book in a day and would recommend it to anyone who likes to read FOR FUN.Haters gonna hate, but this book has more mystery and suspense that 99% of basically everything else."
"This is a really interesting and well-written novel.It portrays a troubled alcoholic woman whose booze-induced actions and resulting amnesia are manipulated by other characters. The story centers around the disappearance of a young woman and the interaction among the protagonist, her ex and his wife, and the down-the-street neighbors. Much of the story occurs on the street adjacent to the rail tracks viewed from a train that the ""girl"" frequently travels.The carefully-timed character development perfectly allows the story to unfold and the suspense to build. The story is told from several characters' perspective adding to the plot and the personalities. The author's detailed picture of the personalities and the telling of the story my several main characters sets apart this murder mystery from most others."
"This book is absolutely riveting. It is one of the best mysteries I have read in a long time. The writing drew me in from the very first page and I could hardly put the book down after that. Anyone who likes books by Tess Gerritsen will love this book. I liked the character of Rachel, even though she could be so exasperating. While the other characters were a bit less likeable, I could emphasize with them. The ending was a surprise to me, which was nice. I don't like to figure out "" who dunnit"" halfway through the book. I cannot speak to the comparison to Gone Girl. I saw the movie and thought it was just awful, so I never read the book. I highly recommend The Girl on the Train, and do look forward to the movie."
"There are 5 main characters in the story and in each chapter, one of them is telling the events through their eyes - and so you have to remember the names and the dates are not consecutive, but jump back and then move to the present in the next chapter - her style of writing is a bit challenging; however, as the mystery unwinds, the suspenseful mystery builds and it gets harder and harder to put down.  The story starts out from the perspective of the girl on the train, who looks through the window and on the porch, watching glimpses of this couple, as the train makes a daily stop across from their house.  The story picks up the pace and pretty soon you will not be able to put it down.  There were a few graphical errors which made me go back and reread a few sentences, but it didn't detract from the story.  A great ride."
"At first I wasn't sure I'd like the book, as it started quite slowly and almost burdensome at times. But I stuck with it, and I'm glad I did! As the author gave us more details about each character, she started weaving the web that eventually trapped me and I was hopelessly and deliciously entangled. As she fed more and more details, the story took many right and left turns, and each time I thought I'd solved the mystery another detail was leaked and I found I was completely wrong. I could not help but finish the shocking climax in one sitting, each event unfolding at just the right place, finishing with the most unlikely heroine saving the day. Get and read this book - and be prepared for good ride. All aboard!"
"I had anticipated a bit more writing talent, this was an okay story, one good enough to not put down without finishing but, on the other hand, had I lost it or not finished it I would not have cared.Made out to be much more suspenseful than I found it to be and the details a bit outlandish, like trying to fit jigsaw puzzle pieces into a puzzle where they truly don't fit and say "" there, that's good enough"".Read it if there's nothing better around but I would not pay for it.  Just okay."
"This book starts to engage you from the beginning.  I had not read the book when it first came out, but thought I should when I became aware that a movie was being made with one of my favorite actresses, Emily Blunt.  I enjoyed the pity, irritation, and fondness I had for the main character.  Sometimes she was hard to like, but the author kept me stringing along.  I won't write more because I hate when someone writes a spoiler.  If you haven't yet read this book read it now it is truly a great story that is well written in a great style!"
"At first, it was difficult to get into the story. A bit confusing and a lot of back and forth between characters and dates. Fortunately, for me, there were only three character's point of view. I finished the book in three days. The first day was arduous, but once I started again, the second day, it was almost challenging to put the book down. Finally, on the third day, I couldn't stop until I finished it. Surprising twist at the end and at times I suspected it could be..., but then thwarted the idea of it being so. Definitely a great, suspenseful read."
"Much hype about this book.  The interaction of all the characters was improbable. While it is fiction and a snapshot of a time in space, none of the characters were particularly likable or realistic.  Hard to find much empathy for or identification with any of them. I know alcoholics with some of the devastating results experienced by Rachel.  Not sure people ""recover"" their memory or black-outs as quickly and clearly as Rachel.  But it would be a very long book if in the real world. The two babies in the book, one living, one deceased, were the ones for whom I felt anything except vague annoyance.  Imagine attempting to navigate such a self-absorbed adult world.  While the book moved quickly, ultimately I was disappointed."
"""The Girl on the Train"" is a voyeuristic, cleverly plotted thrill ride.  Paula Hawkins is a first-time novelist.  She's a writer and editor by profession though, so 'Train' is no flying blind leap into a new career.  The writing and plotting here is ingenious and first rate.Were someone to tell you about the literary device employed here --- three first-person voices, alternating by paragraph, over different time periods -- you might think, jeez, that sounds hard to follow.  It's not. You pick up on it right away and get immediately into the flow.You can almost see the cinema version of the book in your mind's eye as you blitz through it.  So, no surprise then to read that Dreamworks preemptively acquired the rights to Hawkins' work late last year."
"I was so disappointed in this book.  The characters were sad to read about and the plot line was horrible.  I would not call this a ""thriller.""  It was more a sad commentary about self destructive behavior."
"I usually don't read these kinds of books, I think mostly meant for women.  But, once I got into the story and the twists and turns, I could not put it down.  I too wondered all along who the culprit might have been, and was somewhat surprised when I learned it all near the end of the book.  Although an interesting presentation, the chapters for a particular character need not have been identified as ""Morning"", ""Noon"" and ""Night"".  Somewhat different for sure, but a little irritating that was not necessary for the reader.  Excellent description of the neighborhoods outside London, and the train service which is also very good.  I have used it myself, on a holiday.  Easy to get around for sure.  So keep up the good writing and let us see what's out there soon."
"yuck!  I just disliked this book so much.  it seemed like a real take-off of 'gone girl' in some places and at times it felt as if some of the episodes were lifted directly from that book.  at any rate, I did finish it but am now looking to give it away to anyone I can since I don't plan on making it part of my permanent library."
"This book was recommended to me by a friend.  It's not the type of book that I normally choose.  When I first started reading, I wasn't quite sure that I was going to like it.  Rachel, the main character, was somewhat annoying to me (and this feeling lasting throughout most of the book).  It was also a little confusing switching back and forth between characters.  However, after a few chapters, I was hooked.  The author had a way of describing the characters that made you feel like you knew them.  Although it did take me a little while to really get into the story, before long it was hard to put down.  It is very suspenseful."
"Its a good read; it pulls you in, never boring. Hawkins' use of multiple narrators helps the story flow well.  It is a dark story. The characters are each unlikable, some less than others, like Rachel, the main character. She is the only one in the book I could feel for.  I can't quite understand why some characters were the way the were, like Detective Riley. I guess my imagination will fill in the gaps there. There is a turning point in which the book becomes a bit predictable, but I can't say when as not to give away any spoilers."
"I was hopeful with this book but truthfully was not very impressed.  While it had alternating persons telling the story, it jumped around too much at first in my honest opinion.  I knew it would ultimately come together at the end, but I found myself questioning whether the author was trying to be ""sophisticated"" and it was a little unnecessary, because not only did they describe a certain date but also whether it was the morning or evening.  That could've easily been determined if it wasn't broken up into sub-categories but just mentioned in the writing.  I also didn't find too much depth in the characters.  It was clear one of the handful of characters was the guilty party and it wasn't difficult to figure out by process of elimination.  It was a little disappointing. Just my 2c."
"This book takes hold of you from the very first page and never lets go.  You get involved with the characters,  the plot, and all the twists and turns.  Can't wait to see the movie.  Hope Hollywood does it good."
"I like that the killer is totally someone different than you'd expect and that it is written from three perspectives. Would definitely recommend hardcover or paperback rather than kindle as the dates bounce around. It was a little hard to read about the constant drunkenness and alcoholism, and this made it a little frustrating in the first half from Rachel's perspective, because all I could think was get it together! But as someone who is trying to understand the disease of alcoholism and addiction for a family member in my own life it was helpful to sort of see their struggles, self-loathing, and first hand disease. It sets the book up brilliantly as to how/why the killer did what he did. Excited to discuss at book club."
"It took awhile for me to understand the narration.  Just who was this Megan person anyway?? It was trying to read about an alcoholic who would voice the right things to do yet she would always do that which would damage her.  She really had no life of her own and lived in the past, bothering her ex husband and his wife, acting as if she were commuting work daily to avoid criticism from her landlord/roommate, dreaming about those people she saw in her old neighborhood as she rode the train.It seems the rambling thoughts and actions would go on forever and without purpose.  Finally the fragmented thoughts and storyline started coming together and suspense began to build.  The last half was a good story but I did question myself for many pages as to why I was still reading this book."
"Great read for my cross country flight, it's a page turner or Kindle tapper to be more accurate. I doubt much of the story or characters will stay with me for long except for the alcoholic Rachel. As with any mystery if you figure it out too early on the rest becomes tedious. For me that was the case with this book and then suspense turned into impatience. But on the other hand if I hadn't been able to somewhat figure it out on my own I would have felt it was an ""unfair"" mystery so all good in the end!"
"This book is a very good read.  I have been at the book store and near the shelves that house this book and heard a person giving their opinion of the book to others and they could not have been more wrong. Then turning to me and saying ""Don't waste your time it is not a good book.""  Not to give any spoilers but what they were commenting about was the writing and how it was a little ""All over"".  It is supposed to be written like that, from the point view of the main character who has some issues and needs to figure out what is real or not.  I really enjoyed this book and know several others who have too."
"I was spellbound, could not wait to get to this book every day, but my balloon of excitement and admiration burst with the ending. It was as if the author could not think of a good ending, so decided:""Let me get this over with, I will just write anything to end this mystery"", and here we were stranded with a no good solution that did not hold water after all the excitement that we had built up.Inger Ross-Kristensen"
So many twists and turns.  So many screwed up personalities. I felt it was depressing from the get go.  The more I read the more the personalities become more screwy.  Not a feel good read.  More like pathetic lives getting more pathetic.
"Confusing ... took me 3 times to get through the beginning because of the way the author makes the name of each chapter a character's name and goes back and forth in time.  For this reason, I had to keep putting it down.  Then time lapsed and I had to start over.  Finally put it down again for a long time and decided just finish it already which I did quickly.  Picked up the last 40 pages so only an OK."
"Good opening, entices the reader into the story.  The three person narratives at times became confusing, especially if the reader put down the book and did not read it straight through, since there certain similarities in the character's traits. The author made good use of an ordinary circumstance of daily train riding to bring home a lot of good points.  The train is a metaphor for the lives of the three women in varying stages of decision making; Rachel caught in between life and destruction, Anna craving to move and Meghan who actually does make a move. I found their stories so intertwined for a while I thought they might be one woman with three personalities. I found the ending justified and was glad the author indicated the forward movement of the remaining characters. A good, light summer read."
"After all the hype, I was expecting more mystery and drama........sort of a nail-biter. But it's not that kind of book. It's more about what goes on in several character's heads, especially the main woman. It was just okay."
"This is a page turner. I was completely engaged in the story and always in suspense. I loved how the writing alternated between characters and how you really get in their head and yet see what they think of the others! The alcoholism was accurately portrayed. So glad I did not watch the movie first as I wanted to create my own visuals and see if the director was able to bring it. Good movie but disappointing in regard to being true to the story and bringing the suspense. For one the setting takes place in the USA in the movie. Wtf? I wanted it to be in England! Too many things missing from the movie as well, but thats the way it is. Books are ALWAYS better! Great read. I recommended it to my friends and they were NOT disappointed!"
"The book was well written: there weren't many cliche' bits and there wasnt too corny an ending.  It kept me up thinking and wanting to continue to read on, even as my eyes were shutting. Interesting twists and turns to keep us off guessing how things would work up to the end.  Definitely a youth or young adult read."
"I am in the minority that didn't love this book.  It was slow in places and the final twist fell flat for me.  I guessed the person about half way through and was disappointed to find out that I was right.  I did like the feeling of being the person on the train who is playing Nancy Drew to help solve the mystery, however the drunken blackouts became predictable and made me skim the pages a bit.  I enjoyed the writing, however I would not call this the next Gone Girl.  I do not think the writing quality or story telling is anywhere near that of Gillian Flynn.  I think if you are looking for a Flynn style psychological thriller, you should pick up Mud Vein or Marrow by Tarryn Fisher.  The Girl On The Train is not as dark and twisted as I was hoping it to be."
"I bought this book mainly because it had been #1 NYTimes best-seller.  Big mistake.  I regret the time I wasted reading it.The vast majority of the plot energy centers around the female protagonists triumphantly discovering, verifying, agonizing over, and obsessing over the infidelity of their husbands. There is not one word about any attempts to solve problems or make a better marriage. There is not one word about the good side of any marriage.. On the contrary,If this bleep is to be believed, the only propose of marriage is lose-lose to give e the wife cause to feel bigtime aggrieved.  If that were the case, women's best course would always be to avoid marriage altogetherThat said, Hawkins weaves  in a powerful and non-preachy.anti-alcohol subtext.  If this book saves one young woman from life-destroying ravages of drink, that would be terrific.  But a good read it is not."
"Mixed emotions here.  I was really looking forward to this book, based on the reviews, liking this type of book, having lived in London, and rode the train numerous times.  Maybe my expectations were, therefore, too high.  I found it hard to ""root for"" anyone; even the main character was hard to feel for, as her difficulties were for the most part self inflicted.  You have to pay attention reading this book.  The chapters switch among the three main characters, which was easy enough to follow.  But what I missed at first is that they are not necessarily in chronological order.  So when I got to a new chapter and saw which character's perspective was being told, I had to read the date and then go back to the previous chapter and compare dates to see if I was going backwards in time.  Easy enough to figure out, but just something to keep track of.  I never got to the point of ""can't wait to pick it up and read some more"", although I was interested enough to finish it just to see what happened.  I thought the writing was well done.  Good book, not great."
"After first hearing Paula Hawkins on NPR last year, I knew I had to read this book myself.  The problem was that it was too far down on my TBR pile for me to get to it anytime in the near future.Last night, however, I finished it.  I couldn't stop with ten pages left! I had to know!  I wasn't suspect of the killer the whole length of the book, so kudos.  Thank you for writing a page turner. For me, it was never dull at all. I will just have an extra shot of espresso in my coffee now that I stayed up too late finishing this one.Highly recommended!"
"A good read.  I like books instead of movies, so this was one that I might've gone to ""see"" in the theatre...  (I know there's a movie now and am considering it.)  Loved the twists and turns and the ending."
very nice book with a well written easy to read. a surprising events and you will not understand until you finish the book. every single corner of this novel contain a story. waiting to see the movie.
I was disappointed given the large number of stars many readers gave this book. I think 3 neurotic characters is way too much for a story - I felt like I was bouncing back and forth among the storied women and none of them evolved into a substantive character.
"I found this book very difficult to get into at the start. I had to go back to the previous chapter to check dates, but once I realized what the author was doing, the story became more suspenseful. It starts with Rachel, a train commuter, imagining the life stories of the people she sees out the window of the train everyday as she passes. She is especially concerned with a couple that lives in a house in her old neighborhood. She believes their life to be perfect. But all that changes as the woman turns out to be missing and the story turns to reality. Now the author moves the story along as told by the three main characters viewing the same events from each characters point of view. It was very interesting and difficult to decide who had the correct view as each had their own previous experiences that colors their outlook and Rachel has a drinking problem with blackouts. Rachel complicates matters becoming involved in the reality mixing it with what she had imagined.Even though I had trouble getting started, I kept reading because of all the previous great reviews and was rewarded with a great and differently told mystery story."
"Let's get something straight, I finished this book in less than 24 hours. Couldn't put it down but mostly because I wanted to see if I was right...and I was. Writing-good, characters-good, storyline-good. But if you're a regular reader of thrillers then it's not difficult to figure out. All that being said, I'm glad I read it and I look forward to the movie in October."
"This book is often compared to Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl, which was a much better book IMO. As I read this book I was often able to predict what would happen next, and the author's attempts to create suspense<U+200B> sometimes fell flat."
"I was surprised to see so many five star reviews for this book. About the only part I could agree with was that Rachel's character was indeed bleak. The plot was limited as a soap opera, and I felt there had to be more to Rachel as a human being than this sniveling, self-absorbed wimp completely dependent on others. All three women base their happiness on whether or not they are desired by men. Scenes of confrontation that could be have been filled with dramatic tension, such as the ending scenes with Rachel and Anna, or Rachel and Tom, ended up contrived and ho-hum. I wanted Rachel to discover something about herself or reach deep within for inner strength she didn't know she had. I like to be left with thought-provoking ideas at the end of a book. I didn't feel anything with Girl on the Train."
"Though the book, like a train, took a bit to get up to speed, I really liked where Paula went with this.  I found myself becoming attached to the 3 main characters and loved how their stories unfolded. The read is pretty simple, yet very enjoyable."
"I absolutely loved this book. I have heard it being compared to Gillian Flynn's works, and I guess I see a slight similarity, but Hawkins did a great job of setting her own tone & pace. It's painful reading from the main character's perspective sometimes because she is just so screwed up, but the book itself was a great read. Enough twists and turns to keep me on my toes, and only a tiny bit predictable on occasion.I have said this to everyone I've recommended it to: The main character's room mate is the unsung hero of the book. What she deals with... pffft. I don't think I know anyone who would tolerate their room mate to act the way the main character does."
"A very dark and depressing book. I only finished reading it because I wanted to find out who the murderer was. I didn't care for the chapters toggling between dates in time and characters. The three main female characters were hard to differentiate in personality as were the two male characters. Lastly, the book would have been much more enjoyable if a British vernacular was used. Were it not for the names of the towns and a few other words or phrases, one would think the setting was in Canada or the US."
"This novel is written exactly as a movie, particularly the doble ending, so you're actually reading a thriller you might as well watch in a theater.  The writing is compelling and keeps you reading until you realize this is just another story written by the numbers with a very predictable ending.  Female characters are minimally interesting and the men don't come through as real and the action and red herrings are very transparent. If you are a regular reader of thriller and mysteries, you'll guess this one before you're half way through.  I suggest wait for the film that is already made or buy a cheap used softcover."
"I read this for my book club; otherwise I don't think I would have read this on my own. The book was too much of a downer for me. All the women's stories are pathetic and tawdry, and they seem clueless about how to improve their circumstances. I don't like reading woman as victim stories, and this one is no exception, even when two of them get past the hatred for each other and team up to expose a killer. The book is well written and the plot is suspenseful, but the ending is rather predictable. I didn't understand what all the hype was about and sorry to say, I still don't."
"I really enjoyed this novel.  There's already tons of in-depth reviews, so I'm not going to do that.  I will say that at the beginning I was saying to myself, well this is just odd.  But soon I was completely involved and didn't want to put it down.  After I finished, I needed to talk about it, it really stuck with me.  So I googled the title and found a fantastic spoiler discussion and that was a great debrief for me.  It was really great to see what everyone thought of different things.  Specifically, I was shocked when I read that some people knew whodunnit before half way.  I certainly did not identify the person, and only had a pretty good guess before the denouement.  I may read it again.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book."
"Good story, though a bit dark.  I actually detest books and movies that are too dark, but this one had a small element of perseverance that helped me swallow some of the dark parts.  All in all it was still very entertaining.  I had trouble putting it down, but some of the ""twists"" were fairly predictable.  I was so engrossed by the main character that I had to catch myself from thinking I had some of her same issues!  Some of the suspense was created by some slightly frustrating means (continually forgetting certain details, not realizing certain things about her past), but still made for a great book.  Not on my top 20 list, but I would still recommend it.  Plus, it's a fast read, so why not?"
"I wanted to love this book. Unfortunately I guessed who the murderer was when the character was introduced by Meagan. Am I a super sleuth or even a third tier Nancy Drew, nope it's that obvious. I think for me the rush of recovered memories at the end was disingenuous. Also the loving odes to Rachel's various alcoholic drinks were beyond tedious. I don't know if it was intended by the author and I am displaying my ignorance of a literary device but the drinks were a well established character. There were parts that were smart and I would become engaged, but then we were back on train sipping a G&T."
"This was for book club and we were all in agreement - utterly forgettable beach read. As this book was compared to Gone Girl and Rear Window we went in with high hopes. Unfortunately, you have three unsympathetic, unlikeable women who are unreliable narrators with similar voices, and the two-dimensional dysfunctional men in their lives. I figured out the murderer about two-thirds of the way into the book. The ending is nothing short of unbelievable. The one thing the author does get right is that alcohol-driven black outs are not caused by the failure to remember, but the brain’s failure to transfer events from short term to long term memory. She then discards this fact when her plot’s stuck and she needs Rachel to remember something in order to end the story. A very disappointing read."
"What a miserable waste of time and money! There is virtually no story line--just the rambling, disconnected thoughts of some miserable soul. I quit reading a quarter of the way through--utterly boring. (And as an English major, I will read most anything, including the back of cereal boxes, most of which are more entertaining than The Girl on the Train."
"Up until the last 20 - 30 pages, I was all set to give this book 3 stars.  I thought it was well-written and kept my attention, however, I had a very difficult time with Rachel.  I don't have to like characters in a book, but I like to understand why they do the things they do ... so that I can at least have empathy for them if not sympathy.  But, in the end, I not only felt empathy for Rachel ... but sympathy as well ... and found myself really rooting for her.  I figure that's a pretty good book that can change my feelings about a main character so drastically."
"I was excited to read this book because Amazon suggested it was similar to Gone Girl. However except for the multiple point of view format, the book is not great.I had to force myself to continue reading through the poor writing. I believe a good author would use descriptive words, not generalization of moods and character based on brands.( there was a lot of name dropping, was the author beings sponsored by these companies?)The book was shallow, the characters were shallow and I felt uncomfortable with the way women were depicted as weak victims and men as testosterone driven neanderthals.I loved the premise of the book, which is the only thing that kept me reading through the events and characters that were not clever or interesting."
"I read ""The Girl on the Train"" entirely on the train--actually the subway--and it's a great, light read for my commute (unlike Rachel, I don't drink on the train, but I do love to read to pass the time!). It was a compelling premise--woman thinks she might have been witness to a crime, but doesn't remember due to alcoholic blackouts--and definitely passed the time entertainingly, although it did get a little repetitious in the last third of the story. The use of shifting narrators was clever, but not quite clever enough to stop me from figuring out the true killer ages before the denouement!"
"If you're looking for an easy, enjoyable read without too much depth, this book is for you.A decent novel by anyone's standards. Well written with the right amount of humor and wit. (British humor and language is always something I enjoy -- a break from the norm.)However, I don't see what all the rave is about. It's another Gone Girl in style and plot. Don't get me wrong, it was definitely a page turner and I often found myself wanting to get back to reading as soon as possible. But, in the end, I just did not love this book.I guess with all the hype about how great of a novel this was, I got my hopes up. High expectations and average quality make for a semi-letdown reader."
"This is not my usual genre, but I am so glad I read it. Ms. Hawkins, you are phenomenal,####spoiler alert###I was so confused, I actually thought Rachel did it. I was like damn she was so angry about about Meg cheating on Scott she killed the B, and what the hell did Meg sleep with the psychiatrist??? And Anna, so vapid until the end then wham!! She is just as crazy as the rest of them and you realize the only same one is the drunk. The ending is not happy, not really. But its the only realistic way it could have ended."
"This debut novel is told via three first-person narrators, all female, one of whom is the title character.  I found Rachel, the alcoholic title character, sufficiently complex and believable; though her excessive drinking makes her somewhat contemptible, it also makes her human, and I was able to empathize with her.  (Rachel's drinking is a necessary plot element, as it prevents her from remembering critical events.)  What makes this a less impressive novel than ""Gone Girl"" is the novel's narration.  One narrator is somehow able to recount for readers what is happening to her as she dies.  The mystery surrounding her death is, however, suspenseful enough to make the novel an interesting read."
"I knew this story was not going to be pretty; after all, the main character is a pathetic drunk and a compulsive liar.  Every person in this sordid little drama has something to hide, and the book is written in such a way that the hidden parts don't fit together 'til the very end. The rotating viewpoints got to be tedious and confusing, especially since I wasn't able to read many chapters at one sitting. If you read this novel as an e-book, the repeated chapter headings with the same names will make it difficult to keep your place in the story line. I agree with many other reviewers; there was not a single character in this book that had any redeeming qualities. That said, I can't say I hated it; they all got exactly what they deserved from each other, as a bunch of scheming, selfish, violent liars."
"Interesting plot twist though by the time the book got there I had figured it out.  This story starts out very slow, and I nearly stopped reading out of boredom and thought about deleting it.  However, I stuck with it and the last half of the story was much better than the beginning.  I wish the entire novel would have read as well as the last portion.  I wouldn't call this one a ""must read"" but it wasn't a waste of time either.  If you have time to read the entire story in one or two sittings, it's probably worthwhile.  Otherwise, I would pass on this one and look for something that flows better."
"Having truly hated the book ""Gone Girl"", I can't stand the comparisons many make. Yes, they both are dark, twisted mysteries with unlikeable protagonists; but, while I found GG to be predictable and without any redemption, I found ""The Girl on the Train"" to be engrossing and at least somewhat redeemable. I've given it 3-stars only because I found it a bit hard to follow the characters at first and all the time jumps. I wish I had listened to it on audiobook (which I basically never say!) as I hear it was a really astounding book to listen to and more clear with the use of 3 distinct voices."
"Rachel, the girl on the train, has had a rough time of it.  She's definitely not where she thought she would be.  Rachel would ride the train to London every day for work, watching the houses as they passed.  One of the houses that she watched was the one that she use to share with her ex-husband.  Tom now shares that home with his former mistress, now his wife, and his infant daughter.  Four doors down, is a house just like hers use to be.  Rachel watches the couple in that house and creates an imaginary life for them in her mind.  She imagines their names, their love for each other, their life together.  Things are not as she imagines and as her drinking gets more and more out of hand, her bad decisions lead her down a dangerous path."
"I am always drawn to stories told in first person and this book is a great one.  The story as it unfolds, is told by the three women in it.  These are real women---flawed but so human.  One has a problem with alcohol, one a problem with restlessness and fidelity and one has compromised for security and a ""dream"" life.  You will find yourself annoyed with them at times and at other times cheering for their small victories.  The story involves a disappearance of one of the women and how the other women and the men in their lives are all drawn into the mystery.  The plot is intriguing and clever the way it unfolds.  It builds to a great ending that ties everything and everyone together.  All questions come together and are answered.  I couldn't put the book down until I found out what happened!"
"I am reviewing this book in my husband's account as we share it and I am the one that purchased this book. I enjoyed the book overall and found it a quick and easy read. There were not many characters to follow which kept the ""mental effort"" a bit low at times and I found myself wishing the plot could have moved a bit more quickly. That's being said, I did enjoy the character development and final twist. I have loaned the book to several friends and everyone has enjoyed the read. I have read better books but many that are much worse!"
"I really enjoyed reading this book.  It kept my interest and I found myself looking for time to ""squeeze in"" a few more pages.  I actually finished itby reading late into the night under a ""sheet tent"" in bed so as not to wake my husband with the light from my Kindle. I did predict the ""bad guy"" early on, but I tend to do this with maddening accuracy on movies, books, or stories my friends relate to me.  The Girl On The Train did movingly portray the costly nature of alcoholism realistically from the alcoholic's viewpoint and her understanding of the frustration felt  by family, friends, and life bystanders.  All in all, an entertaining, easy read."
"This was a pretty good book. It moved a little slowly at first, then picked up and had a slightly unpredictable twist. I say that because it was sort of expected but you were not so sure until your suspicions were confirmed. It was a good, relatively easy read and I would recommend it. It does provide an insight to the sort of darkness that envelops you when a vice takes you over. That aspect was the most interesting; being brought into the fictional world of an alcoholic and sufferer of depression was fascinating."
"I absolutely adored this book. I will not going into detail as to what happens, because I don't want to ruin the story for anyone, but this book will keep you on your toes. You almost feel creeped out at times by the rising in tension and switching points of views. It was a wonderful experience reading this book. I didn't expect the ending at all, which doesn't happen often! It's a book that gives you relief and sadness when it's over. I would (and have) definitely recommend to a friend, or anyone who likes psychological thrillers. 10/10."
"I read this book with high hopes as Gone Girl was really enjoyable. If you haven't read Gone Girl, this book would be a good read but I feel they had too many similarities. It was also a little slow and the female characters all seemed very weak and poorly developed. It does quite a bit of jumping from future to past which might make it hard to follow if you don't pay attention to the dates that the chapter has at each beginning.Overall not a terrible book, but like I said it seemed to similar to Gone Girl and the characters seemed a little flat for me with no real hook to keep my attention."
"The narrative style that alternates between three of the main characters is a clever and fascinating way to tell a story about love and marriage. The entire novel is an interesting commentary on the role played by memory, perception and observation and how little of it can be trusted.This is not a story for those seeking flawless heroines and heroic men. All of the characters are deeply flawed. The three main women - Rachel, Megan, Anna are compelling nonetheless. They make terrible mistakes and use incredibly poor judgement. Alcoholism, lying and cheating are not held up as excuses for their destructive behavior. Above all, they are human. The author brought all of these characters together in a skillful, although not totally unexpected way.Four stars because the end was a little too neat."
"Although I have not read ""Gone Girl,"" the story contained within ""The Girl on the Train"" is very reminiscent of that story--thrilling, gripping, mysterious, unsettling. As soon as you wrap your mind around the world the author has developed, you will be hooked. As the characters begin to interact, the plot twists and turns in unexpected ways that will more than likely leave you reading this book within a minimum of 24 hours. I literally purchases this book last night before falling asleep, read it for 4 hours, woke up, read it for another 4 hours, and was blown away by its resolution. A must read for anyone who loves a story with a good twist."
"This one kept me turning the pages.  It presents you with a cast of characters who's lives have touched.  They are all woven together by the relentless imagination of one alcoholic and tragically lonely women, Rachel.  While you know that she has an active imagination you go right along with her as she attempts to make sense out of her rudderless life.  She manages to drag her ex-husband and his family into her drama and a couple that lives a few doors down as well.  Every day brings just a little more information to the light.  But what is true and what has her mind made up?  It is a page turner and when one of the characters goes missing it keeps you up at night trying to reach the conclusion.  A good one.  Well worth it."
"I bought this book just because it was on the best seller list without looking what it was about. I really like the premise about an alcoholic girl who witnessed things important to a murder investigation that no one believes. The book is told from three different women's point of view. The main thing I disliked about the book was the changing of perspectives that I felt weren't transitioned particularly well to form a seamless story early. Later on they started making a lot more sense, and were a lot smoother. All together it was a decent but slightly depressing with very few if any characters that are likable."
"The Girl On The Train was a really great story!  The author has a way of making you relate to very unlikable and undesirable people.  It was suspenseful, the writing was good and I didn't find a lot of typos or issues while reading this book.  I saw other reviewers that were very negative and claimed that ""the author with-held important information and tricks you...""  And to that I say ""So when reading every book ever, you go in with full knowledge of everything that is happening to all of the characters automatically - Or do you read and learn more information as you go???""  This book was no different than any other suspenseful, mysterious, fictional book I've read.  It was Thoroughly enjoyable --- READ IT!!  You won't regret it!  ~Niki Noel"
"I very much enjoyed this book...I was easily caught up in the downward spiral of the main character and found her both appealing and repulsive.  Some of her actions seemed uncharacteristic, but since I am not an alcoholic, I may not be the proper judge.  The writing is very good and the character development, though a little spotty for the ancillary characters, was pretty intense for the main character.  I subsequently saw the film and enjoyed it just as much.  It definitely was a benefit to have read the book."
"Every once in a while I read a contemporary book and wonder how in the world it made it to the best seller list.  This book is an example.  While the mystery itself is interesting, I have read many that are far, far better.  The chief problem is that all three of the female characters are similar, and the two male characters are nearly identical .  Furthermore, each character began to sound like the other.  It is the responsibility of the writer to have each of the characters speak differently--different rhythms, different word choices--all this helps the reader to differentiate who is who.  Now it is perhaps just possible that the author's intention was to say we are all alike, but I don't think the novel is that sophisticated. If you want a good train mystery, may I suggest Agatha Christie."
"What I liked about this book was that the narrators weren’t entirely reliable or likeable. One of my favorite lines comes from Rachel, who is battling alcoholism. She says, “How much better life must have been for jealous drunks before emails and texts and mobile phones, before all these electronics and traces it leaves.”The first person narrators don’t have distinctive voices, so if you put the book down in the middle of a chapter, it will take you a second to figure out who is talking (you can figure out if it’s Rachel if she’s talking about how much she wants a drink, for example.) All in all though, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will recommend it to friends because I couldn’t wait to come back to it to find out what happened, and I wasn’t disappointed."
"It is popular and I was curious. It is interesting as a tour de force in the psychological genre, but I found it diffuse and a bit tedious. I never felt that I cared about any of the characters in the story. The journey I was being led on thus never really captured my imagination. To me, that is a significant failure in plot and character development. Perhaps, it is just not my type."
"Wow! This book was amazing! I couldn't put it down and wanted to read it any chance I could. It was suspenseful! The main character, Rachel witnesses a couple outside their home every day from a stop on a train and becomes a bit obsessed with their lives. She names them and imagines what they are like. She envies them since her own marriage failed. The funny thing is, her exhusband remarried and lives right near this couple.  But then the lady she often sees, Megan, goes missing! It's a mystery and an obsession for Rachel. She gets to be a part of their lives through lies and her obsessive snooping. She is an unreliable narrator since she also has a bit of a problem with getting flat-out blackout no memory drunk. Such a treat to read. You will be bummed out once you finish it : ("
"When I first perused this book I was not impressed. But then last Wednesday came along and I had spent days preparing for a medical test and after that was done all I wanted was to get lost in a great book. Luckily I picked up The Girl on the Train again and was off and Running. A day later, I was done and completely satisfied with the talents of the author and wished I could hop into another one by her. Sadly, I have not found one yet. If you love to get lost in a powerful story with very well drawn characters and a stunningly artful plot with suspects galore except for the surprise ending, then be my guest. Buy your ticket today for a wonderful ride on the train of Hawkins Imagination and you too will take a trip via her talents which you will be grateful for."
"I found the story extremely boring. I quite before getting one third into the story as it seemed to just go on and on and on, and on, and I kept asking myself what is the point?  Finally, I realized I don't even care what the point is anymore. With nothing happening, I simply quit reading it.  The great reviews I don't get at all."
"From all that I'd heard and read about this book, it still wasn't quite what I expected. It moved slowly in the beginning and was kind of confusing. There were times when I went back and reread to keep the characters straight. It did pick up the pace in the middle and raced to the end, sort of like a train. I thought the characters could be developed more. You only know them superficially. When I finished the book, I still wanted to know more about them and their motives. Still it was a pretty good read and I was sort of surprised at the end."
"I would have given this 5 stars if it had been written in 3rd person and past tense.  There are 3 narrators and they all sound alike.  There is no difference in their thought patterns or modes of speech.  I think that writing in the 3rd person would have helped the author to make these characters ' voices more distinct.  As for writing in present tense, that's one of my pet peeves and probably won't bother anyone else.The plot, pacing and atmosphere are truly excellent.  I was kept guessing right up till the end, and I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.  I look forward to Paula Hawkins' next book with great anticipation!"
"This was definitely the best book I have read in a very long time!  From the very beginning, I was captivated by the characters and the suspense.  Paula Hawkins does a wonderful job of developing fascinating characters, and the plot is absolutely amazing, creative and suspenseful.  I had no idea ""who did it"" until very close to the end.  The writing is excellent, and I do hope she will continue to write books, and I will certainly follow her.  I read this book in only a couple days, because I simply could not put it down.  I could've read it even faster if I didn't have a few other things to do from time to time (like cook, clean, etc.)  I'm definitely looking forward to this author's next book."
"I really liked this book. I was skeptical that I would like it as much as I did, given how some reviewers compared it to Gone Girl, which I hated. There were some slow spots, and the main character's drunkenness got a bit tedious at times. However, the author did a great job building suspense. I was sure I knew the identity of the killer early on, but the twists and turns in the story made me realize my initial assumption was incorrect. Kudos for tricking me, even though I did figure it out before any of the characters <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084>"
"I first read a small snippet of what this book was about from a magazine and it sounded so good,I couldn't wait to read it.I was a fan on Gone Girl and this definitely read similar to that I'd say. It was unexpected that so much of the story is inside the character's heads and really not much dialogue or your typical mystery/suspense book. It was a fast read that kept me interested, but once I figured out the ""twist"" I thought the ending fell a little flat for me. I was expecting/hoping for something more. None of the characters have any redeeming qualities and overall I felt like it was a lesson in ""the grass isn't always greener.."" type of thing. I read this book while on vacation and it was perfect for that."
"I haven't finished it yet but am 3/4 through.  Really like it... I listen to it in my car when driving.  Sometimes when I arrive at my destination, I sit in the car to listen more because I don't want to stop 'reading' it.  I thought it was a comedy and it is not...it is a murder mystery but a good book all the same.  Not real fond of the F word and some content was uncomfortable for me personally so that is why the 3 not because of the author but the content of infidelity, mental illness, alcoholism, etc."
"I was personally recommended this book by a coworker and man am I glad that she recommended it! It is an amazing tale told from three different women's points of view. Rachel-a battered, alcoholic who was left by her husband for another takes the train everyday and imagines made up lives of people who live on the stops of the train. Megan-who suffers from guilt, anxiety and loss who tries to mask her pain in things she shouldn't. And Anna-a wife and mother who is trying to deal with her husband's ex all the while trying to be the perfect mother and beautiful wife. Their stories intertwine and lead up to a Saturday night when a great mystery happens. Filled with suspense, mystery, death and what real life throws at us ""The Girl on the Train"" is an excellent novel!!!"
"This book was a bit too unbelievable even for fiction. It follows the lives of three women and their love intrests who all live on the same block and get to know each other through very contried circumstances. The characters were somewhat compelling but not very likeable.  I certainly wouldn't want to befriend any of the three main characters Rachael, Megan, or Anna. I found I could not identify or sympathize too much with any of them. The author switches between characters telling the storyline bouncing from each point of view.  The male counterparts were not nice guys. I found myself asking why I was reading a book about people I didn't like who did horrible things to each other and so many people involved in the plots. Just happy I don't live on that block."
"Over 5000 reviews so not much more to add here... But....Did I enjoy this book?  Yes.Is it a page turner?  Yes.Did I want to read this book when I wasn't?  Yes.  So got through it in a day and a half.  Nice way to spend a rainy weekend...Was it worth the Kindle price?  ($9.17 US) Yes.Did I learn something form this book? No.  With some books you walk away knowing that you have learned something about life or some aspect of life and in some ways, have grown from the experience.  But to be fair, while I did enjoy this book immensely, I am not a wiser/better person for it.SPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTOk, if Megan never told anyone but her therapist about Libby (and he's not allowed to say) and Mac is dead, how did the media find out?"
"I didn't expect to like this book as much as I did.  I'm a stickler for well drawn out characters, authentic dialogue and believable plots.  When I started this book it hooked me right from the get-go, which I love, and had me counting the hours until I could sit down and read some more.  I thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning to end.  Not a terribly involved and twisted plot line, but I love the unreliable narrator aspect of it, and this author clearly knows how to use that and make it work."
"I love mystery novels.  Twisted, simple or predictable, they appeal to my glass is half empty dark side.  But I also love depth in characters, which appeals to the psychologist in me.  The story is clever and twisted.  The idea of time and perspective as essential parts of the story is a good one.  Without the depth of character, the interruptions make the story seem somewhat more convoluted than clever and the characters more caricatures than complex.  An excellent first beginning with hopefully greater character development without the flighty time transitions to distract from the great use of language."
Hated it. I couldn't read more than a few chapters. Boring
This one is not real deep and leaves me feeling a bit sorry for so many pathetic yet relatable characters.  We've all met each of these personalities at some point. The multiple narrators format kept me reading and somewhat entertained waiting for the final twist. Good book to read on a plane or...a train.
"i honestly don't get all the hoo-ha regarding this book...in fact, i found it so boring that i quit 2/3's in... i did skip to the end to see who ""done it"", but i had no empathy whatsoever for the protagonist, who is an unrepentant alcoholic and liar who makes life miserable for her long-suffering roommate as well as herself..don't bother with this book, there are so many better written ones with more interesting storylines and female protagonists.. such as the latest by karin slaughter..."
"While the writing style of going back and forth between characters - perhaps emulating the back and forth motions of the protagonist on the train, the writing itself felt redundant rather than allowing the story to progress. The ""who done it"" aspect of the story is well told and there is intrigue, but I question how this book rose to become a best seller."
Interesting at first.  Became a bit tedious and unrealistic as it progressed.  Really-an ex wife walks off with your baby and no one calls the police and they continue to allow her to the house?  It just because. So implausible that it lost its entertainment value.  I also wasn't expecting it to be go dark and depressing.
"The book is well written and edited. No complaints there. But for the most part, it's painfully boring.  The entire story could be told in fifty pages, but the author takes three hundred before making it interesting.The main character is another issue. Pathetic and uninteresting. A loser from beginning to almost end. I would not recommend this book."
Was I the only person who thought this book was terrible? Aside from being completely implausible (but not ridiculous enough to be entertaining or diabolical enough to be disturbing) the protagonist was annoying. I hate to describe a character so teenager like but there really isn't much of a redemption in her character or a better way to say it. She's self aware enough and self loathing enough that I couldn't relate or empathize. I struggled to finish this book.
Very slow read.Too much repetition. Disappointed
I don't think this book is worth all the hype.  Actually really a ridiculous story and rather NOT believable characters.  Disappointing read.  Was  what we read for a Book Club discussion and we were all disappointed.
"I've read other excellent reviewers who found the changes in POV and changes in time confusing, but for me they worked quite well.  In fact, the story and the suspense wouldn't have worked without these jumps and I very much liked trying to figure out who thought what when.  All 3 female characters (the 3 POVs) have their perspectives, their differences, and their psychological limitations, so being inside each separately adds to the plots tension.  It's hard to believe that this is a first novel by Paula Hawkins and I look forward to her next.  The Girl on the Train is a fast read and I recommend it highly."
I saw this novel on the best seller list so I decided to read it. I cannot really judge it accurately because it is not my type of novel. The first few chapters were complex and slow but I stayed with it. As the pieces came together the story held my interest. The fact that I finished this book speaks for itself.  It is possible I should have given it four but for me it was not a rapid page turner.
"I didn't like the ""first person"" writing style. I thought the book was overrated, and I couldn't wait until I finished it. I feel that it has a decent storyline, but it just didn't hold my interest."
"Some friends did not recommend this book, others did, so I took a chance and I absolutely loved the book.  The short chapters work for me, and I enjoyed the development of the characters, each chapter told you which character was telling the story.  This is how it works in real life, everyone sees things a bit different.""The Girl on the Train"" seems a bit damaged, but not in the way that is obvious.  She continues to pretend to go to work everyday long after she has lost her job, which was on top of loosing her marriage and a place to live.  All her comfort comes from a bottle, and as it is reality, that person must hit bottom to find their way back.  Bottom actually hits her, literally.  This is the spin that draws you in.  She believes she is a black out drunk, and the tales she is told of what happens when she can not remember.It is a short jump from bad to worse, when our girl on the train begins living vicariously through the couple she passes daily on the way to 'work'.  She envisions a 'Ken and Barbie' couple from the short bursts of their lives she see as the train passes their home, and one day it seems there is trouble in paradise.  The next day the newspaper shows 'Barbie' being missing, and eventually found dead.A mixture of ""Rear View Window"" and ""Gone Girl"", this is a page turner.  Down to the last page I had goosebumps.  Excellent suspense!"
"I had high hopes as this has been compared to Gone Girl. Not as twisted as the Flynn novel, but definitely involves complex characters and a mysterious story line. You're just not sure who to believe... I'm looking forward to the film."
"A good thriller that seems more like a bunch of miserableness at first. About halfway through, things begin to gel. The resolution comes about quickly and leaves the reader thinking about crimes of passion and how they occur on so many levels."
"This is not my favorite genre but was recommended by a friend. This book is fairly well written and I like the changes in point of view and points in time,  however the protagonist is made out to be too much of a victim for my taste and the attempts to divert the reader from figuring out who the killer is were disappointing and predictable. Several ancillary characters were poorly developed."
"Because of the reviews on this book being so good, I stuck with it even though it started out so slow. Most of the book trods along slowly. The characters are well-developed but I didn't like any of them. Things build to a very good ending. Worth a read, but not five stars."
"If you liked Gone Girl, you may like this, and if you did not, you may not want to bother.  Almost too similar for me.When I fail to find any redeeming qualities whatsoever in the characters, I always look to see if I can enjoy the writing.  I almost felt there was just poor editing of the book.  Characters that were immaterial, things that the author kept going back to - maybe all in an effort to divert attention or continue the ""mystery,"" but that just fell flat for me in the end.  I really did not care what happened to any of these people, I just wanted the mystery over so I could close the book."
"The main characters are all women.  The problem is that they are all so sick.  I could not ""root"" for any one of them.  I always need a character that I like and am on there side.  But no, not is this case The writing as a skill did not particularly create any differences between in any of the three women.  They were all one dimensional.  I know who the killer is and the killer is of course-sick.  Oh well,  it will help me like the next book on the night stand"
"One of the best books I've read this year.  I loved the first person narration--by three different narrators.  The women's stories start at different points in time and converge at the end of the novel.  (Watch the narrator and dates on each chapter as you read.)  Perhaps the most original murder mystery I have ever read.  I would say more, but I don't want to give anything away!"
"IT WAS NOT MY CUP OF TEA, I DIDN'T FINISH IT"
"It's an interesting read, but the characters are all pretty unlikeable. Very similar to Gone Girl, but without any of the ""holy sh*t!"" moments. If you liked Gone Girl, skip it. If you didn't like Gone Girl, skip it."
"Thrilling page turner. Although it took me a while to catch on to the chapter structure of the book, in the end it was a brilliant hook that kept the plot twists coming in fresh waves of deceit.Set in England, focusing on nos. 15 and 23 Blenheim Road along an active set of commuter railroad tracks; Rachel Watson has a daily fixation on the people she sees living out their lives along the tracks as she travels in to town for work. Until one day the daily routine of bliss and serenity goes dark. Rachel finds herself caught up in the swirling ebb and flow of deceit as she finds herself pulled into the middle of a missing persons investigation.I found the unique [to me anyway] chapter structure engaging, serving as a series of flashbacks and among the series of first person accounts that drive the story forward. I shudder to think just how real and probable this plot can be. The human mind and the heart that drives it is so very depraved that the evil depicted in this story is very believable.While I don't mind a bit of profane language in a story where it's a real world situational necessity - soldiers swear in combat, lovers loose their tongue when in the heat of discord, etc. - the language got a bit rough toward the end which was a bit of a turn off for me. Beyond that, I found the book enjoyable. Beautifully edited, there are some spots where the 'British English' served well to remind me of the book's setting...not in my American neighborhood.Bravo Paula Hawkins on a contemporary work of art that will certainly stand the test of time."
"I have not a read a book this great since Gone Girl. I could not put the book down while reading it, and finished it in two days at the beginning of my vacation. It really kept me guessing the entire time and I was so invested in the characters that I could not wait to what had happened. I was shocked at the end of the book and thought that the outcome was great. I recumbent this book to anyone who likes thrillers. It was definitely a great read."
"(SPOILER FREE)The first two-thirds of this book make a cracking good mystery, full of red herrings and twists. However, I guessed the answer to the plot's central question pretty early on and when the ending confirmed my guess I felt disappointed.The ending just seemed too implausible in a book that I felt had some real emotion and insight in it.Go ahead and buy it if you want a quite enjoyable 5/6 of a book. I don't regret the purchase. The writing before the reveal is quick paced but steady feeling and the author is good at parceling out the clues and mysteries and at keeping the suspense going. It was also a pretty quick read."
"The Girl on the Train is entertaining but if you know an alcoholic it is almost theraputic.  I do, I was married to one, and it was as if my ex was the subject of the story.  The author characterizes the excuses, the shift of accountability, the self absorbed personality perfectly and makes what to some may be an unlikely story very real to those who have lived with one.  There are some plot twists and other than the alcoholic implications the theme is that nothing is really as it seems.  I avoided this book for months, seeing it in the best seller list, but finally decided to give it a shot.  I enjoyed it."
"I read the Sample of this book and thought maybe, maybe not.  Then my daughter recommended it, so I started it again.  At first I was a bit put off by Rachel and her drinking but then it started to become a very important part of the story and I stopped thinking of all the people in my life she reminded me of and started getting caught up in the twists and turns Author Hawkins was leading me through and found myself anxious to get through each chapter and onto the next piece of the puzzle.  A few reviewers have compared The Girl on the Train to a Hitchcock Thriller and I wholeheartedly agree.  Not sure how good a movie this would make but I am sure that it is a Great Read.  Start it as soon as you can and be prepared to not want to do anything else until you finish."
"Girl on the Train is the story of a brokenhearted young women  (Rachel) whose husband has left her for another women.  She seems to have lost control of every part of her life as she obsesses about it.  The pace is fast as we enter Rachel's  mind because of her obsessive compulsive circular thoughts.  There are three voices in this story which is good because one could get very tired of Rachel's chatter.  Going back and forth between these different voices builds suspense and we begin to wonder whose voice is the real story.  There are always questions.  First impressions do not last very long.  While I became tired of Rachel's angst, there was enough going on in this story to keep me turning the pages.  I would recommend this book for a good absorbing read."
"Had heard so much about this book - I couldn't wait to read.  Other than being a little bit different of a read in terms of charater perspective, and accurately portraying an alcoholics denial, I can't say it was a page turner.  Certainly portrayed women as needy, dependent and manipulative.  Not worth the time it takes to read."
"It was a good enough read to get through quickly, but I felt deflated at the end. It was all about affairs, promiscuity and alcoholism (and murder, of course). There were no likable characters here; even the cops were sleazy. It wasn't clear why Rachel lied so incessantly; it was unnecessary and only got her into more trouble. It just added to her already deeply flawed and unsympathetic character. And at the end, after the trauma she goes through, she miraculously sobers up. Seems like the opposite was more likely. The way it was written, with the back and forth first-person narratives, seemed a bit amateurish.The story was pretty good, and  some character development does occur. But I don't think it comes close to Gone Girl, as some of the reviewers have compared it to"
"Welcome to the mind of a woman slowly loosing it to the ravages of alcohol, self-destructive behaviors, and a very active fantasy life.  We meet her at the bottom and watch her struggle back to something resembling mildish sanity.  If you haven't the stomach for alcoholic ramblings and drunkalogs, you will probably want to stay away from this book.  If you can stick it out because you have been going to AlAnon for the past decade, the payoff is fan-freakin-tastic.  Craziness, obsession, sex, lies (but no videotape).  This is a great ride and a perfect summer book, and -- in the right hands --it will make a heart-pounding film. I can see all those awesome younger British actresses lining up for this one."
"This is the first book that I've read where I didn't like the main character. Throughout the story, I got annoyed with how the main character inserted herself in an ongoing murder investigation under the guise that she knew the victim but she never did. The way she drank so much and butted into business that did not concern her, annoyed me. At the end of the novel, I finally started to like the main character because she found strength in herself to stand up for not only herself but two other women. I'm content with the ending of the book because of how she redeemed herself and ended her misery that was unexpectedly cause by a person I never suspected until the last few chapters."
"I must say I was very disappointed for a book heralded as a ""thriller."" I found this book very difficult to follow with the constant switching of 1st person narratives. And the day to day mishaps of a drunk was very laborious. Of the 323 pages only the last 30 or so were mildly ""exciting."" From the midpoint of the book on, I just kept saying ""please get to the point!!""  Others who had read it and saw me reading it would say ""hang in there, it will come together in the end."" Not my idea of  ""thriller.""  I absolutely don't understand the rave reviews, while respecting differences of opinions. Unfortunately ""buying"" the book myself adds to the undeserved hype."
"I came close to dumping this book after about 4 chapters...it is a slow-burn.  I really disliked where I thought it was going. But, since it was on the Best Seller List, I thought there just had to be more to it. I was so pleasantly surprised at how this book developed.  It was really, really good!  I hope this author can write more books that are this full of surprises!"
"I liked it but I don't think it lived up to the hype.  It was okay.  I saw the movie after I read the book and it was pretty much the same.  In the book, if you don't notice at the beginning of the chapter who is narrating, it could get confusing.  I didn't notice in the beginning that it was not all narrated by the same person."
"The premise of the story about watching people and their lives while on a train appealed to me. I can imagine making up stories about the people you would see every day.  However, I found I was not looking forward to reading it. The author kept going back and forth with dates and flashbacks and I found myself backtracking to see what date we were on. The story developed too slowly and the characters were just not all that interesting. I put the book down after reading more than half of it. I was just not enjoying it. I will not read another book by this author."
I didn't enjoy the start of this book and nearly put it down but because I didn't have anything else to read at the time I persevered and am glad I did. Whilst the whodunit side was fairly obvious by the third quarter of the book I was compelled to finish as I had finally found some empathy for the main character. I'm not sure I would bother reading one of her novels again but am not disappointed that I read this. The main issue for me was the dislikable main character who wasn't quite complex enough to be interesting either
"Much better than Gone Girl, and the perfect antidote to boredom. The kind of book you want with you for a long flight, an interminable wait, or a rainy Sunday. The author's style definitely leaves something to be desired -- you can't really distinguish different characters' voices, which is a problem in a novel written in several first-person points of view -- but the pace is so fast and the subject so hypnotically interesting that you simply won't care."
"I do not usually read thrillers. I throw that caveat out there because that's the reason for my being unable to rate this full marks. I will say that I didn't like things about the book, but I cannot decide whether they are real flaws or whether they are just my own dislikes of the genre. The book is dark, twisted and more than a page-turner. But it has a restlessness, an unequivocal torsion that makes it difficult for me to believe the behaviors of some of the character. I enjoyed reading it, even despite this seeming flaw, but it left me feeling (as many books of this ilk often do) that the trouble is not over. The restlessness, endless and unabated, will haunt for longer than I am comfortable with-requiring me to read something mindless and fluffy to dispel it quicker from my brain. If that's the real aim of the thriller genre, maybe it deserves full five stars. I leave it to be determined by the reader who revels in such things."
"I was really excited to read this book based on all the positive reviews. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed.The story takes a really long time to get to anything really interesting / shocking. When I read the summary of the book, it says she sees something shocking that will change everything. I have to admit that what she saw was not shocking at all. It was VERY underwhelming. I actually thought something else was going to happen when she passed by the house, but nope.The ending was OK - nothing that crazy. Just not what I expected."
"I didn't think I would finish this book at first because it was a little slow for me in the beginning.  However, the further I got, I didn't want to put it down.  I'm glad I continued to read.  It was fun trying to guess what was going to happen next."
"Slow build up to a predictable and terrible ending. The ending was wrapped up so fast and easy that it left me angry. Plus, I don't think some characters would act the way they did in the ending. I don't understand why the author included some items detail throughout the book and never made them relevant.Overall, this book had me interested and I liked the format, but it only let me down completely. Who wraps up a story like this in a few paragraphs?"
"For those looking for examples of mental health diagnosis' this is a book for you.  Each character has extreme issues that mess with the other's to give the reader continual pity, and curiosity (how bad will it get) about where these unstable people will wobble off to next.  The men are bottom feeders and the women are addicted to alcohol, false opportunity, sex for power and drama.  This books hits all the buttons for today's best sellers."
"This was a good read.  It was suspenseful and the ending was somewhat of a twist.  I suspected (correctly) who the villain was well before the end, but the way the author got to the resolution, WAS surprising.  And I liked that the protagonist was definitely NOT a heroic type...she was human.A good book, and I recommend it to anyone who likes suspense books."
"This is the worst book I have ever attempted to read.  I kept thinking it would get better based on reviews.  Must have been some of those ""fake"" reviews.  Don,t  waste your time. If you are seriously depressed, in poor shape with a low self esteem, read this it will make you seem feel like your life is not so bad but actually great."
"The Girl on the Train was one of the most engaging mystery/suspense novels I've read  in a long time.  I found myself reading for long periods of time just trying to find out what was going on and who the perpetrator was.  The plot and characters were interesting, realistic and complicated', not to mention fascinating.  This was a great read!"
"If it ever happens again that I consider a Paula Hawkins book, I pray someone shakes me until I come to my senses.Muddled and exhausting. The ramblings of an alcoholic, schizophrenic, nymphomanic?  The story got too sickening to figure it out.  It is hard to believe that so many people bought this book.I believe the comments by A. Grace hit the tack on the cranium. Wish I had read that before I ordered the book."
I heard this referred to as this summers 'gone girl' but this story doesn't have near the intrigue and depth of that novel. the characters aren't developed really at all except for maybe Megan and I found myself  not really caring what happened to any of them. Aside from details it was pretty easy to predict the ending about half way through. pretty disappointing little read but not terrible  for a mindless afternoon or two on the beach.
I just wish Rachel had a happier ending!!! I really enjoyed this story!!! And I loved that I read the book before I saw the movie!!! A lot more information than the movie!!! I enjoyed the book; you really got to see what the characters were really like!! At first I didn't like Rachel and then when I continued to read I felt sorry for her and was egging her on to do the right thing and get her life together!!!
"I thought I would enjoy this book because of all the positive reviews. However, I did not. It was very confusing and boring. It was hard to keep track of the characters because each chapter jumped from character to character.  It took me about a month to read this book when I can usually read a book in a few days."
"All three narrators of the book are unlikeable. It's very depressing and the beginning is quite slow, but overall it's a decent read. Many people describe the ending as a twist but I would disagree as I found it somewhat predictable. The ending was also underdone in my opinion."
"What a miserable waste of time and money! There is virtually no story line--just the rambling, disconnected thoughts of some miserable soul. I quit reading a quarter of the way through--utterly boring. (And as an English major, I will read most anything, including the back of cereal boxes, most of which are more entertaining than The Girl on the Train."
For the life of me I can not figure out why this book was the Number One seller for so long.  It had no redeeming features.  All of the characters were flawed and I thought the action was very slowly paced. Yawn.I couldn't connect with the protagonist who was a slovenly drunk or the harping flat mate or the harpie 2nd wife or the domineering husband or lying cheating husband.  What a Wonderful Bunch of Characters.It's a cheap imitation of Gone Girl Gone.
"Hawkins' novel entertaining, but not simple. She captivates the reader as she increases the tension in the narrative, and one is never sure how the story will end until the very last page! This is a novel that should be read more than once to appreciate its layered texture."
"I had a difficult time finishing this book. It's written as a mystery, and that is the only reason I finished the book-to find out the ending. For me, I found it impossible to like the lead character, Rachel. I couldn't feel sorry for her, couldn't feel any empathy for her, nor did I care about her as I read along. I even felt that way at the end. This is very unusual for me. I found it depressing, and I dis-liked Rachel so much, that I almost put the book down numerous times. It was almost irritating to read about her. This book has been compared to Lost Girl. I can't see it at all. Most of the characters in this book are so miserable, that it was almost painful for me to continue reading. I felt it was a waste of my time, and am glad I didn't recommend it for my book club."
"Hated it. Could not figure out why it was on the best seller list. It was crap and tired of her being an alcoholic all of the time. Had I not paid money for the book, I would not have finished reading it."
"I loved this book for about 200 pages. It was so unique and fresh... Until it wasn't. What started as a page turning, edge of your seat kind of story became quite predictable and cliche. Still a good read and I enjoyed it quite a bit."
As I read I kept thinking that Racheal has to be the dimmest person on the planet. She is supposed to be the heroine or the victim or the antagonist or the court jester?! Eventually found my self reading just to finish not because it was a great read.
"Great book! Haven't seen the movie yet, but from watching previews I could tell that the details and character building in the book are way more in-depth than portrayed on screen. That's always the case though. :) Give the book a shot even if you've seen the movie. It's a great suspenseful read."
"I can't remember the last time I felt so ripped off by a novel.  I suppose it's my own fault because my imagination was at work from the very beginning: the design of the title.  Alfred Hitchcock was at work with me.  As a student of film, it took me a few chapters to try to puzzle out the possibility of the narrator's being a dual personality.  Again, the double vision of the print on the cover of THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN reminded me of the split image of the title design of PSYCHO.  I was excited to see how the author would be able to pull this off in print.  Well, I was wrong, and as I continued reading, flipping back and forth with the dates, the characters, and the plot, I finally gave up on any hope of my imagined premise.  I did finish the book, unlike several of my friends, but felt that everything ground down to nothing more than a soap opera on steroids.  The one issue that I developed respect for was the author's handling, with impact, of Rachel's alcoholism.  She triumphed, and that was a relief."
"Had heard so much about this book - I couldn't wait to read.  Other than being a little bit different of a read in terms of charater perspective, and accurately portraying an alcoholics denial, I can't say it was a page turner.  Certainly portrayed women as needy, dependent and manipulative.  Not worth the time it takes to read."
"Very well-written psychological thriller. Very well developed plot, and kept me turning the pages until the end. As soon as I started reading, I thought of Agatha Christie's 4:50 From Paddington, which was one of my favorite Agatha Christie books.The Girl on the Train has a bit more complication in that it is told from the viewpoint of three narrators, none of whom are reliable. This is a dark psychological thriller type book, and it kept me reading straight to the end. I started it on a Friday night and had to force myself to put it down. Then I picked it up very early the next morning, telling myself I would only do a few chapters, but I blew straight through that promise. I don't want to divulge too much of the plot, but it involves a divorced woman named Rachel who takes a train into London everyday where she has a good view of her old neighborhood and the house where she once lived with her ex-husband who now lives there with his new wife and baby. This new wife is the woman for whom he left Rachel.But Rachel's life is different now and all seems settled when a murder occurs in the old neighborhood. Rachel involves herself in the investigation. I won't go any further except to say this really is a well-written thriller and I can highly recommend it."
"The book took me about 50 pages to get into it, then I could not put it down. I bought this because I saw a movie was being made, but I must say, the book is way better. I did not see the twist that occurred. I thought it was great. If you like suspense/mystery/twists, this is a great book."
"While I enjoyed the whodunnit and it kept me guessing almost right up until the reveal, I think this is the first book I've read where I actively disliked all of the main characters. I don't like Rachel, nor Megan, nor Anna, nor Kamal, nor Tom, nor Scott. While I'm sure they were written this way on purpose -- everyone deeply flawed, with no endearing or redeeming qualities, so anyone is a suspect because they're all crappy human beings -- ultimately it made for an unenjoyable reading experience; it felt almost like a chore. You know how there are books with some story lines that you like and others that you can't wait to get through so you can get back to the ones you like? Well, that impatience to get it over with is how I felt about 100% of the book. I felt constantly annoyed, regardless of whether I was reading from Rachel, Anna, or Megan's perspectives; I didn't like being in these women's heads. I'd still recommend this book for those who want a murder mystery that does a good job of keeping the reader guessing, though."
"I don't understand this book's popularity. I found it initially confusing, eventually quite tedious (I was reading it for a Book Club so made the effort to finish the book) -- and I disliked the characters, who were fairly unpleasant and focused on self. I would never recommend this book to anyone. There's a lot of wonderful literature available. Don't waste your time reading this book."
"I felt this book dragged for the first 250 pages.  It basically dealt with Rachel's alcoholism, driving her ex-husband crazy and her involvement as an alcoholic in Megan's disappearance.  It was over the top.  The only character who seemed halfway normal was Anna.  As one reviewer said, ""Why did Hawkins put the man with the red hair in the book?""  I have no idea either.  I usually give great ratings, but I can't do it for The Girl on the Train ... it was just okay.  It's no Gone Girl, that's for sure."
"The story was told in somewhat confusing narration. It was very hard to care for the main character and about three quarters into the plot, it was clear who was the killer. It was very hard to care for the people, they seem flat and one dimensional. The writing was OK, but lacked the ability to grab your attention fully as it was jumping from person to person with no seeming connection and the story felt like it was not developed with neither."
"With almost 15,000 reviews when I downloaded this book earlier this week I was expecting the best book EVER.  Admittedly it's good but not the eye-popping story I had hoped for.  There was the interesting twist at the end but noir fiction is not my thing.  It's a good murder mystery but far too dreary for me to recommend it highly."
"I thought there was going to be an interesting premise, and I was intrigued by the setting and how the plot was set up; however, the ensuing book showed a group of characters that lacked empathy, a moral compass, and any self-awareness. By the end of the book, I was really annoyed that I had invested the time. I would NOT recommend this book to anyone."
"Read it in 4 hours one night (couldn't put it down!) but should have waited for day time because I was really scared after finishing it! Haha. Fun book. Figured out who it was around page 200 (out of 326) when a vital clue is given, but still was fun reading to put together all the pieces of why that made sense, and didn't resolve until the last couple pages. Very fun book."
"A little on the dark side, but read it in two days! Can be a little tough to follow the dates at times as it jumps back and forth (found myself flipping around quite a bit to figure out where I was). Overall, very entertaining read. Purchased another copy as a gift for a mystery-loving family member! Heard it is similar to Gone Girl, but heard others liked Gone Girl better."
"I saw the book being advertised everywhere. I read the first few pages and decided to buy it. I literally skipped through the last of it. The characters were unbearable. You could barely cheer on rachel, just when you were starting to like her she would fall back in love with her mean, insulting ex husband.What a waste. Weak women in a weak book. Bleah"
"I found myself reaching for my kindle every time I had a few minutes to kill, reading this book whenever I had a chance. I couldn't help but like the main character, Rachel, who was always full of good intention, and meant to do the right thing. However, at the same time, she's someone that I would avoid in real life, since she was clearly one ""messed up"" individual. The story was well written, giving the 3 female characters' perspective throughout the plot's twists and turns. Very enjoyable!"
"I'm surprised this book is such a runaway bestseller. It is compelling early on, but I found the end to be less than shocking. In fact, there are so few main characters in this novel that it's pretty easy to figure out quite rapidly who the killer is. I found all three of the primary female characters to be loathsome with few redeeming qualities. After a few chapters I found myself becoming more and more frustrated with the main character (Rachel) who makes the same mistakes over and over again.  Having the plot move forward through the voices of three women does increase the suspense, but I expected a more original ending; something unexpected and incredibly jarring would have been a nice reward for the reader. Truly, I don't see what all the fuss is about.  It's an okay book, but not outstanding by any means."
I did not like this book. I did not care what happened to any of the characters. It was gimmicky and not written very well. Stopped reading a little after midway through because I really wasn't interested to learn what happened to anyone. You have to create characters that touch a reader in some way in order for them to want to find out what happens to them.
"Such ugly people.  Wish I didn't have to read this for my book club.  I may have begun this on my own as it has been a top seller for so long, but I would have quit after 50 pages like I usually do.  Such dribble!  Not a good mystery even though poetic justice is served here."
"It was very difficult getting into this book. It did nothing until about 2/3 of the way through. Even when I thought something was going to happen and piqued my interest, it fell apart and did nothing. The book was dull, laborious, and even the ending was so-so. I DID manage to finish it though just to see if it would improve, so I give myself credit for that."
"Stupid book stupid story poorly written…last time I buy a book because it is a best seller….a four paragraph idea dragged out interminably….just terrible….author & publisher must have a great deal to their PR agency to get his turkey on the""best Seller"" list…."
"This is one of those books that you keep reading despite the fact that you've realized many times that it is thoroughly unenjoyable.  You keep telling yourself to stop it and find that you've swiped yet another page on your Kindle. There are NO, repeat NO,  likable or sympathetic characters.  This is a sad group of dysfunctional, alcoholic, abusive, self centered, narcissistic, weak willed people.  And Oh yes, some of them turn out to be murderers.  Not everything that I read, needs to be a feel good novel but in reflection, this book had no redeeming value whatsoever and left me feeling depressed and annoyed that I hung in there until the end.  I would have given it fewer stars but felt that, in fairness, I did keep going until the bitter end and that probably justified my 3 star rating.  I do not recommend this book."
"The main character constantly enters into situations with no plan about what she is going to say or do.  It was very tiring reading over and over again, ""I know I shouldn't do this, but...."" and off she goes.  It was sad reading about someone with no self esteem and always so drunk she couldn't remember what she had done."
The train of the story was reallllly slow getting out of the station. I found the heroine tiresome and unsympathetic. Couldn't relate to her dismal and self-destructive behavior. I put the book down and didn't finish it. I'm amazed that it's still riding the top of the best seller lists. Must have been something interesting that eventually happened.
"Although the story is slow to get into because of its unique style of changing first person speakers, it turns out to be a page turner. It is well structured because the reader does not consider Tom as the killer until Rachel finally remembers him with a woman at the underpass. A good read. By Alice Dennis Kennedy, author of the new novel, THE SCAR, but itand Extraordinary Circumstances"
"I thought this was a bad book. The characters are one-dimensional (you can sum up all of them in one or two words) and the plot was pretty predictable and tedious. The characters do the same thing over and over and the dialogue repeats itself (""you have to stop this""). The way the author uses multiple narrators should provide more depth and intrigue than it actually does, since quite often it turns into each character saying more or less the same thing about the same incident.I know this book is a huge hit and now a movie starring the lovely Emily Blunt. I can't say I really know why. However, I did learn that one can buy gin and tonic in a can in the UK. On some things it really does seem like the Brits have things figured out."
"I'm probably one of the few people who didn't enjoy this book.  It was definitely a quick read, so for that I did like it (quick beach read).  BUT i thought it was so predictable and the characters weren't developed at all.  Wouldn't waste your time on the book unless you want a quick, mindless read…ha which is why I actually read it."
"I must admit that I was not a fan at the beginning. The book started off rather slow for me. However, I'm that person that when I start something I have to finish. The book doesn't have chapter numbers so I can't really tell you when the change happened for me, but I'm glad I stayed with it. Really good read. I gave four stars for the slow beginning."
I struggled thru Rachel's drunkenness. I wanted to leave the book but forced myself to finish. It is depressing  and the ending left me with a hopeless feeling.
"I'm probably one of the few people who will submit a review like I am about to do. I really don't understand what all the ""hype"" was about this book and I certainly don't understand how this book made it to the top sellers of 2015!  I am an immersion reader and in this case (with this book) I am very glad I was. Half way through reading this book I was going to stop reading and just chalk it up to ""The first book ever that I have never finished."" However, thanks to the wonderful narrators at audible, I trudged through the rest of the book, hoping that it would get better, (and it did, the last 4 chapters! ) Excellent ending! It's  just ashame that the reader has to go through 80 percent of  the main character who's an alcoholic whining, lying, ""falling off the wagon,"" feeling sorry for herself, and waking up to blackouts where she's thrown up! So sorry, not my ""cup of tea as they say!"" The story just seemed to go on and on and I didn't think Megan's (Jess ) whoever, character was defined enough as the others were. I don't know maybe I'm just tired of the whole alcoholic, enabling, dysfunctional relationships, you can look around and find them on every corner, I don't need to read about them! That's just my opinion and I'm sticking to it......"
"This is a breezy, alternating-first-person suspense story about some seriously troubled lives, with the angle of a murder mystery.  The narrating characters (Rachel, Megan, Anna) unfold through streaming thoughts, scheming and rationalizing and recalling the past, as they take actions affecting each other and the outcome of the story. Rachel, besides her drinking problem, has an almost freakish invasiveness into other people’s lives, showing up at the oddest times and trying to help out, a murder mystery nosiness combined with a serious lack of judgment.  Megan has a lot in her past to be sad and sorry about as she drives irrationally toward finding her truth.  Anna pretty much takes what she can and then begins to resent it.  In a rehash of stereotype, these women’s lives revolve around equally distorted men who attract them, hurt them, or abandon them in one way or another. It’s a sad tale about some sorry lives.However, strangely, it’s also readable and mildly entertaining.  I enjoyed the device of the train, and the story is told in a fast-paced and entertaining style, engaging while oddly detached from any deep exploration of characters.  I hurried through to see the plot unfold, while at the same time I felt a dislike for the characters.  Is this a device or a fatal disconnect between style and substance?Attempting to give the book a chance, I found myself wondering if its appeal is that the author is holding up a mirror to our own flawed selves, if we are to find the answers there.  All the characters are living a lie of some sort.  Maybe it’s a comedy or a tragedy about human failings? We watch Rachel repeat her dependent behaviors and we want her to get a grip as we hope we would, but does she ever, really? Will her friend Cathy ever apply tough love? Will Megan finally find healing through therapy?  Will Anna get past living another’s life?  Is Scott the ultimate control freak?  How many lies will Tom tell?  Is there any redeemable character here?  Is the book a commentary on today’s 30-somethings, in today’s relative freedom to be what you want to be, leading empty, dependent lives, with past losses to blame it on?  Rachel says, “let’s be honest: women are still only really valued for two things— their looks and their role as mothers.”  Really. Is this true or just another lie she tells herself?There are hints of insights, as when Megan reflects upon therapy, “the holes in your life are permanent. You have to grow around them, like tree roots around concrete; you mould yourself through the gaps.”  This sounds deep, and we almost think there could be some character development here.  However, the plot rushes to satisfy the murder mystery, leaving the desperately superficial characters largely unredeemed."
"My sister and I loved the audible version of this book. We listened to it while on a road trip and had trouble shutting it off when we got to a destination.  It is so well written, great character development and always keep us guessing.  The narrator is also excellent.  I highly recommend this book - in print or narrative form."
I liked the author's style of writing. She got into each character's thoughts deeply and emotionally. And she was skilled at uncovering the psychosis of each character. She certainly dwelled on the darkest aspects of people.It was not an enjoyable read for me. I found myself judging the characters for their poor behavior and selfish and impulses. And holding them responsible for their sad state of affairs. This story did not evoke much sympathy from me and is not a good example of the triumph of the human spirit.The author's writing style was better then her story. I guess I just like more uplifting story lines. I hear enough of this sorted crap on the evening news.
"I had to go back to this book after totally dropping it in the middle. I found Rachel to be a drunken horrid character and it was hard for me to empathize with her. I went back because so many of my friends said they'd really liked the book and the 2nd half wanders less and develops the story fully. Worth reading, not at the top of my list though."
Bought the book because of the hype from Amazon.  The book did not live up to expectations.  Each chapter was written from the perspective of the character named as in the chapter title.  It took me awhile to catch on to this and caused me significant confusion.  Maybe I was slow on the up take but I am used to a book being from one persons perspective.
"This book grabbed my attention in the beginning, however that quickly went away. I was expecting more, but that never really happened and it became predictable. I never really enjoyed any of the characters as they were all pretty unlikable. There was a lot of potential here, but it fell short."
"Definitely not a fan of this book, it was slow, couldn't like or relate to any of the characters. The story in and of itself was not suspenseful at all. Got a little over 1/2 way through the book - that's as far as I can take it."
"I did not care for this book at all. It was confusing, the characters jumped in and out of the story until you weren't sure who you were reading about.I just kept hoping this dragged out book was going to get better, but it never did. sorry, a harsh review, but I just didn't care for it."
"Why has this book been in the number one NY times best seller list for so many weeks is beyond me. It is boring, repetitive stories of this alcoholic woman, very depressing.Some kind of murder story that does not make a lot of sense. At t his point I am skipping but will go to the end. This has been a really waste of my money."
"It was, I suppose, a murder mystery.  Its main character was an alcoholic to the max.  It was a sad story which easily can deplete you of energy.  Set in the U.K., the characters were disappointing - over and over again.  I know it was on the ""Best Seller List"", but from my vantage, it is difficult to understand why."
"Really disappointed after all the hype. The characters were all intellectually lacking and the alcoholism and pure foolishness of the main character detracted from the story. I really didn't want to waste my time finishing this novel, but erroneously assumed, given all the positive reviews, that it would get better. It DIDN'T!"
"I read the whole book in 2 sittings so guess it intrigued me but I didn't like any of the characters. I guessed the end half way through, however years of watching Kojak as a kid have made me a semi professional at guessing who ""done it""!"
"I am disappointed in this book.Though Hawkins's approach is refreshingly unique in terms of pacing and perspective, her reliance on stereotypes of men as violent and abusive and women as insecure, overly emotional, and erratic ruined this one for me."
"Don't understand the comparisons with Gone Girl. This was an average run of the mill murder mystery. Was an ok read, wouldn't recommend to a friend."
"I thought this was a depressing story about a down and out alcoholic who has lots of problems. The obscene language was offensive. The plot was unusual and there were some surprising twists at the end, but I would not recommend this book."
"This story rivals Gone Girl for most intriguing in my book. The story was so well written, I felt for the characters. Understanding the state of mind of each was essential for this story and at times I didn't understand what they were feeling but it made me want to so I kept going. Amazing story."
"Perhaps I have really high expectations for what a psychological thriller should be, but the book started off incredibly slowly and ended with me thinking ""that was it?"".The comparison to Gone Girl is what convinced me to buy this book. However, unlike Gone Girl, I was very disappointed in the ""twist"" in this story. It was poorly constructed and almost obvious. Gone Girl did a very good job at getting you to root for the husband before making you believe that he was the guilty party, then revealed the twist. The author here, however, failed to convince me that any of the ""innocent suspects"" were responsible before revealing the true villain. Reflecting on the story after I finished the book, I felt like I just watched one of those mediocre true crime documentary shows like ""48 Hours"" or something."
"Blah. I hated this book. I know I am alone in this and it is likely because I feel I have been reading a lot of books involving crazy or mentally unstable women and maybe this one just sent me over the edge, but I had a hard time connecting to the main character. I didn't really feel sorry for her or identify with her. Maybe it's me? I felt the same way about Gone Girl and I know I am pretty much alone in that."
"This was my first Kindle book, so it was novel for me to read on the Kindle.  I found it difficult to empathize with a woman who was obviously an alcoholic as we have been dealing with a difficult family situation involving an alcoholic relative.  But, because of this, I could understand her memory lapses, her need for the drinks, her obsessions  and her blackouts, but it was a stretch to make her the heroine. Moving between times with just a date as a chapter head was a bit confusing.  I don't know the city and physical locations, so that led to more confusion.  Because I used the Kindle and wasn't familiar with all its features, I might have enjoyed the physical book more, so I could go back and forth a little easier and do some re-reading."
"The Girl on The Train started out slowly, but once I got into it, I wanted to know what was going to happen next (or what she might remember next!).  It is written a lot like a movie - I am sure it will be a movie one day.  It is funny, I don't usually like books unless I like or can relate to the characters.  I did not like any of the characters - AT ALL!  It was a little bit like Gone Girl in that sense.  I did have sympathy for them at different times, but usually just wanted to shake them and tell them to get it together.  It is a great summer read - not too much depth of character and a few we were left hanging with (""what happened to him?!?"") - but very entertaining."
"At first I didn't like any of the characters in The Girl on the Train, but I still could not put this book down. The writing at times was confusing until I understood the author's rhythm. The main character is an addict, so the timeline can be a bit jagged, as this character occasionally blacks out and then has to go reconstruct what happened during those lost hours.My book club read this book. It gave us lots to talk about and everyone liked it. A couple of us figured out who the killer was before the end of the book and a few were totally surprised.I would compare it to Gone Girl, but I did like this book better."
"Overall this is an enjoyable read. The story is told from the perspectives of three women, the main one being Rachel, a despairing drunk whose life unraveled. Rachel's narration is often tedious with recounts of her day. A vague character is an element to a story arc that doesn't quite fit with the rest of the story lines. But, hey, Paula Hawkins is a published author and I'm not. So I'll just leave it there. I expect some readers will be avid fans simply because of the storytelling from regular, everyday women who have few voices out there."
"Started off really absorbing, made you eagerly look forward to unraveling the mystery. The author did a good job letting you into the muddled mind of the depressed and lonely main character, Rachel. Her alcoholic stupor seemed realistic and you felt sorry for her.The other two female narrators' point of view kept up the intrigue. But towards the end, all three revealed themselves to be ditzy losers, making unbelievably stupid decisions. The villain was a surprise, but such an over the top character - it played out like a bad Lifetime TV movie. There were a few loose ends that didn't get wrapped up properly, like the psychologist. I still can't tell if one of the characters slept with him or not. The ending blew it for me."
"Starts off a little slow and doesn't get into the plot for a couple chapters/narrations (based on the way the book is separated). However it is important background information that you need in order to understand the rest of the novel. Once you are a few chapters in, it really picks up and piques your interest. I read this entire book in 1 Sunday and have no regrets about it! Me and several girlfriends are all ready it and going to see the movie, hopefully it lives up to our expectations now!"
"The sort of thriller that mistakes frustration for suspense, it's a long series of red herrings, plot twists that turn into dead ends and impending climaxes that become just more delays to drag things out. The plot feels like the author made it up as she went along, which doesn't matter since it's really a platform for a lot of touchy-feely inner monologues by three different women who all sound exactly alike. Naturally they all come to the same realization that men are pigs and if women are crazy, you can bet it's some dude who made them that way."
"I'm not really sure how I feel about this book. I felt compelled to finish it because I wanted the whole story. The way it was written reminded me of ""Gone Girl"" switching from several character perspectives. The overall storyline was intriguing but I just didn't find any of the characters to be relatable. The main character, Rachel, is drawn into this complete stranger's disappearance and life so obsessively that I was almost ashamed for her throughout the whole story. There were real life struggles with alcoholism and domestic affairs and disputes, but the way Rachel came across was ridiculously clingy and annoying to me. I almost gave the book 3 stars, but decided on 2 because it's not really something I would recommend."
"Great suspense novel, I literally couldn't put it down and read the entire thing in a few days which I never do. It did remind me a little of Gone Girl, not quite as many twists and turns but sucked me in just as much if not more."
"We only read a few chapters and it was so disconnected , we quit!  Avid readers, my wife reads to me every afternoon at 1700 while we enjoy a glass, or so, of wine and savor a good story and/or mystery. This one never got started and was not worth the effort."
"A mystery that will have you guessing to the very end. Told from the views of Rachel, Anna, and Megan, we get to see how different parts of the story weave together. Each person sees the situations in a different light and it makes you realize that you may not truly know someone else."
"Did not find this a compelling read. A reader needs to get hooked and that never happened. I need to find interest in or support for a character. Didn't happen. Nothing redeeming about Rachel nor did I care about her at any time in the story.  Sorry, Ms Hawkins, I'll be wary of your next novel."
"I found the novel unremarkable. The characters were all flawed with no particular redeeming qualities. The location was void of colorful description with the exception of the relentless train noises. The ending wasn't particularly clever. Certainly not an enjoyable ""summer read""."
Not one of the characters is remotely sympathetic - in fact they are all quite dislikeable - and the story is an echo of the far better written Gone Girl. It's hardly worth the time to read it and I trudged on only because the blurbs promised what was never delivered: suspense and surprise.
"Dreadful.  It was dragged out and extremely boring.  Clearly I am in the minority with all the rave reviews.  I wanted to stop so many times but kept reading since I paid for it.  I couldnt connect to the characters, maybe that was the problem but i dont think so."
"I found The Girl on the Train a redundant read expecting a climax that didn't arrive. The protagonists path and her interminable ruminating on her train rides, I felt deserved a more satisfying ending. For me it read, like a long short story. Traveling through life using a vehicle like a train seemed such a good idea..."
"I had high hopes for this book. I wanted to like it. The plot was right up my alley. What a let-down. None of the characters were likeable, except Evie, and I'm not sure if she even counts-- she was more of a prop. The writing was decent, which saves it from a one-star rating. If you want a book that focuses on three women, read Liane Moriarty's _Big Little Lies_."
Want to read a book where everything is wrong in everyone's life? Then this book is for you. Not how I enjoy spending my free time.
"I am an obsessive reader, and this book is a NYT bestseller, but I don't understand why.  I found it so discursive that it was distracting, jumping from character to character and flashbacks in time.  Frankly the only reason I finished reading the book is because it set me back 16 bucks."
"I must admit I never even got to the murder.  I found her obsession tedious, though I realize it made the plot possible, because what healthy person would invest themselves in this couple's pretend life?  Also, I found it ridiculous that she would be allowed to take care of that child.  I have to like the protagonist to read a book.  Yes, it limits my exposure to literature, but I have enough negative personalities to deal with in REAL LIFE.  I don't need to have to manage them in fiction.  There's got to be one central, sane person in the literature I read.  I could find no one in the little I read.  She reminded me of Cheryl Strayed (Wild).  Get to a REAL doctor who can help you heal and start living a decent life! Sheesh!"
I finally read this to see what all the fuss was about.  I went in with high expectations and that probably played a part in my disappointment.  I found this to be a boring read.  The girl kept getting drunk and then racking her brain to try and remember what she did while inebriated.  Not the kind of suspense I find exciting.
"I loved this book for about 200 pages. It was so unique and fresh... Until it wasn't. What started as a page turning, edge of your seat kind of story became quite predictable and cliche. Still a good read and I enjoyed it quite a bit."
"An avid reader, I usually consume fifty or more books a year.  Probably the worst book I have ever read, this novel had completely unsympathetic characters, not one of whom exhibited any redeeming qualities whatsoever. Additionally, the plot was contrived, almost dishonest in its attempts to be misleading; it was depressing in the extreme and utterly devoid of any positive aspects. Although I did read Gone Girl, which was much better written, I do hope this"
"Beware, before you know it you will be sucked into this story and won't be released until you read the last page. Even then, you'll be thinking of the story long after reading the last page. In the beginning, it was a little difficult to determine just who was narrating and about whom but the writing was such that you kept going. I would imagine most people who ride a train or bus that stops routinely, fantasize about the people they see or who lives in the homes they pass. This story takes that premise one step further when one of the people disappears. The prose is easy to read, descriptive with good character development and the plot twists and turns may give you whiplash. The Girl on the Train is a really good read."
All the hype on this book this year that perhaps that created my disappointment. Though good and finally half way thru it did grab my interest. Yet still a let down.
"This book is OK, but not much more.  The style in which the book is written is confusing initially.  It is told from the perspective of 3 separate female characters, each with alternating chapters.  I had a hard time keeping track of who was telling the story in the initial chapters.  The main character in the book is not at all likeable.  Really, none of the characters are likeable.  I never found myself caring about the outcome.  I trudged through it just because I have a hard time not finishing something I've started.The book does make a good point, though, that you can never really know what someone else's life is like.  Everyone has their own set of issues, no matter how perfect their life may appear from the outside."
"First of all, I don't care for first person narratives. Secondly, there are no nice people in this story. Thirdly, the tone is as dark and melancholy as the weather in England. Beyond that, each persons narrative seemed to drag on....and on....and on. I found myself skipping pages of thoughts and tangent thoughts to get to the dialogue.  The ending could have been more of a surprise, but instead, it was telegraphed for three or more chapters.  Then the guilty liar came clean at the end: Totally Not believable."
"Finished in a few days. Pretty hard to put down. I'm always looking for a finish to a book that leaves you in complete awe. On a scale of 1 to 10 and 10 being the most ludicrous ending its about a 7. A little disappointed but that's probably just me. Not gonna say what character it was but he or she was to farfetched for me. However this was a very well written and entertaining book. If you have ever blacked out from drinking and know certain things from that night or think you do or maybe have a feeling that you know something bad or good happened, this book takes you down that road."
"I don't read a lot of mystery-type fiction but something in a review led me to think I'd enjoy this. I wasn't disappointed. The whodunit aspect worked, and the protagonist/narrator is deeply flawed, deeply self-aware, and consistently appealing as a character.  I read this on a Kindle, and one aspect of the book highlighted the principal drawback of the device: the difficulty of flipping back to a remembered page in order to double-check a fact. The book has a lot of short chapters that jump around in time. Each one starts with a date, and it's important to keep track of them, especially in the early stages. If you're reading on a Kindle, pay close attention to them or be prepared to spend a lot of time trying to unscramble things later on."
"This was a terrific read but I had no surprise as to what I can only assume was the plot twist reveal late in the book. Regardless, it was a book I enjoyed and I found the characters realistic enough to feel something emotional about each one. The unpredictability of some of their actions and reactions were surprising yet completely human. I think my slight dissapointment came with the comparison to Gone Girl. I understand readers like certain types of books but I do like like the comparisons to books that are the truly outstanding ones. I understand the sales concept but more times than not it sets me up to look for something that is not there. Here,the bar was set a bit too high."
I started this book months ago and I ended up getting distracted and didn't pick it back up until a week ago. I don't know why I ever stopped reading this in the first place. This is one of the best stories I've read in a long time. I love how the author draws you into these characters and twists this story to make you believe certain people could be capable of such a crime. I spent most of this book convinced I knew who the killer was and what happened but I was completely wrong! I definitely recommend reading this book to anyone looking for a good drama/mystery.
"This is a superb mystery novel with twists and turns beginning right in the first few pages. I am not generally a fan of female protagonists, but this was done so well, so effectively that I found the book very difficult to put down. The feeling during the first chapters is that you are peeling the layers of an onion. With each chapter the perceptions change. It is so skillfully written that you are drawn into the narrative. By the final chapters, about 80 pages, I was unable to put the book down and read to the final page. The ending is neither predictable nor unsatisfying. It works perfectly. This is a suprisingly great book."
"I had seen the hype for the movie so i thought that i would read the book.  As it was billed as similar to Gone Girl, i had high expectations but was somewhat disappointed to figure out whodunnit about 3/4 of the way through.Anyway it was better than the average mystery novel so I would give it 4 stars"
"Not the most enjoyable reading experience, though the plot was clever.  What was lacking for me was the development of the characters.  Each character had lots of negative characteristics which made it hard to care that much about any of them.  Only at the very end did 1-2 show some redeeming characteristics. Kind of hard to read about a group of youngish adults making one mistake or poor choice after another.  It was as I were meeting a group of people at hopefully the unwisest time of each of their lives.  Even the therapist character was extremely unwise.  Being a therapist myself, I could only think that most of the characters just needed a couple of years of good therapy to get themselves together."
"I wanted to read this book to see what all the hype was about, but this one really missed the mark with me. Nothing noteworthy happens until half way through the book. There are no likable characters to root for either. I kept waiting to see if ""the girl on the train"" was going to do something interesting or just be a miserable drunk. Yes, the real villain is an unlikely character, but finding that out on the last 5% of the book didn't redeem it for me. I am really surprised this book is so popular."
"This book was an amazing read. Once I started reading it, I didn't want to put it down. Rachel, the main narrator of the book, starts out as a hot mess. She is unemployed, drunk most of the time and can't get over her ex-husband, even though he cheated on her and eventually left her for the mistress. I don't want to say much more because I don't want to spoil anything. If you liked Gone Girl, I think you will like this book. I actually liked this book better than Gone Girl. Rachel is easy to sympathize with once you learn more of her backstory and I liked the end of this book better than Gone Girl also. If you are going to read this book make sure you have a few hours free because you are not going to want to stop reading until you finish."
"...were not my book group's chosen novel this month.  It's a good Page Turner but has too many unreliable narrators.  Also I found the time line annoying. One narrator's  time line was not chronological with the others. I had to keep flipping back to pay attention to the dates. Also too many obsessed female victims, for my taste in this day and age. But maybe that is who I would recommend it too, women who are codependent, but it could harm their psyches also. For mystery fans it's a very good ""Who Done It?"""
"Once I realized the unravelling of this mystery required the primary character to relive her frequent drunken black outs to determine real violence from fiction, I became quickly bored.  That's all this story was - a girl who gets blind drunk 5 days a week. looses her friends, her job and her husband. She holds no respect. In fact the bad guys do the bad things in front of her, knowing that she's too wasted to witness anything and would never be believed if she reported it.I kept hoping she would turn her life around and get sober - there was some hint of that at the end.  I enjoyed the second to last chapter when the 2 arch rivals join forces to take the creepy man down."
"Three narrators, three points of view...where does the truth lie? In this riveting novel, the reader journeys along with Rachel as she struggles to make sense of her alcohol-fogged memories after the disappearance of Megan, who lives down tge street from Rachel' s former husband and his new wife Anna. Loved it, couldn't put it down. Still deciding whose was tthe most chilling voice. Highly recommend."
"Being English, I was the only one in my book club group who could fully visualize all the descriptive passages about the trains, the houses backing up to the railway lines, what the houses would look like, the stations, the underpass, and what the residential streets would be like.  I have, in my former life taken many, many commuter type journeys mostly around the suburbs of London, and know just what the experience is like, especially the unpleasantness of the heat and overcrowding.That knowledge alone made it a very real experience for me, as there was a huge amount of time spent with this.  I hope that the words were good enough to make anyone who has not experience this ""feel it"" too.As for the story itself, I wasn't really wowed by it.  I found the time frames a little difficult to begin with, until I realized it really did matter to know when the particular action occurred.  It was a style that did get easier as I progressed through the book, but initially I had to keep going back, and as I was reading this on my Kindle it is a pain to keep having to do this.I didn't like any of the characters very much, and Rachel was just plain annoying.  I know she had suffered problems in her past, and I should be more understanding of her drinking problem.  I just wanted to be able to grab her by the shoulders and get her to straighten herself out before she destroyed everything she might have in the future.There were certainly plenty of ""whodunnit"" twists, but I did begin to suspect the perpetrator of the crime about 2/3 through the book.  The plot made me want to keep turning the pages as I wanted the answer to the riddle, I just wish I had found the characters more likeable/believable, I just can't quite put my finger on what I didn't like about them.  Maybe it was just that they were British!"
What an excellent read. This book takes you on a ride of your life and at the end of this book it leave you speechless because you never saw it coming. You never know what people are capable of doing when their backs against the wall.
"I was compelled to keep reading this book. It didn't matter that it was the last weekend of summer vacation and I was camping with my family.  Family fun?  Yeah, let me know how that goes.  I devoured this book in two sittings.  It would have been only one sitting but a girl's gotta sleep sometime.  I. Could. Not. Put. It. Down.  I found myself thinking ""Rachel is such a dysfunctional freak!"" over and over.  And that's the technical term:  dysfunctional freak.  And it is that very dysfunction that kept me enthralled.  It was like watching a train wreck--I could see what was going to happen but I was powerless to stop it nor look away.  Despite being a functional, well-rounded and STABLE individual, I could find parts of myself identifying with bits and pieces of Rachel.  I also identified with Anna and Megan as well.  I found that ability to identify with these characters made me feel uncomfortable, and THAT, ladies and gentlemen, is what made this book so good.  It's been 3 days since I finished the book and several times I've wondered ""what Anna's (or Rachel or Megan) up to"" and felt that sting when realizing ""Oh yeah, those aren't real people. Damn.""  So grab a cup of coffee or put the kettle on, find a comfy place, fire up your Kindle, and be prepared for a wonderful journey with characters that will be with you forever."
"A wannabe Gone Girl book, gone wrong.  It's a snoozer for the first 100 pages, picks up a little bit, and then finally about 300 pages in, it gets interesting.  I know some people raved about, and perhaps many others will like it, but just didn't do it for me."
"It took me a long time to decide to read this bestseller because I thought it would just be another psycho thriller similar to Gone Girl, which I did not like. Was surprised by this author, who has excellent descriptive writing and did not dwelve too much into the psychic; story had a surprise twisting final, but believable. Have not seen the movie yet. Will definitely read her next book."
"Was slow moving at first and the main character annoyed me for a while because of her drunkenness and the fact that she was constantly bothering the ex-husband.  However, once you get more into the story and find her reasoning for her drinking etc. she becomes a more sympathetic character.  All in all it ended up a very good book and I'm glad I read it."
"Characters were unidimensional and detestable. The storyline was predictable.Spoiler below:Why go through the trouble of explaining that people affected by alcohol can't form memories and then have Rachel suddenly and miraculously remember everything and solve the case? That made no sense scientifically since she couldn't have formed those memories. Also, to have a character suddenly remember something and solve the case is lazy story writing. How this book got four and a half stars is the biggest mystery. The publishers need to refund me for the book's cost and then I demand compensation for the time I lost reading this book."
This book was a page turner. I could hardly put it down. I particularly liked the character development. I felt such sympathy for Rachel and I thought she was so weak. She turned out to be a strong woman. I liked the way it was written given each character's point of view. A great book.
"This book tries to be thrilling in the vein of Gone Girl but, the main character is annoying her is consistent desperation and self-loathing. Any attempts to redeem her by illustrating her spiral downward, are presented too late and are weak.  I was hoping something more would come but the pay-off fell flat."
"I must say that the book kept my attention through all the complicated manipulative story line . Though from the beginning I hated Rachel for the boring drunk she was, Megan for the unreliable self occupied deeply disturbed woman she was and Anna for the stupid and immoral person she was. Not to think about the psychopath (ATTENTION, SPOILER!) . That the only interest in life these women had was the love of a man is so sad, are really women like that or is it , as I think, a very cliched and insulting idea of  woman? That the author thinks that these women might be considered ""real"" is very disappointing."
"I did Review this at the time I finished the book. It was a strange read but once I started I couldn't put it down. I think it was very good, could have left some of the language out. I don't know why Authors today can't write a book without foul language...maybe their vocabulary is insufficient!Anyway I enjoyed the book!"
"Poorly written book that only has characters that are mentally unstable ..Not worth the money or time to read it , mixed up story that is dragged on and on ..As you can imagine with unstable characters the book makes little sense , I feel that the author had mental issues also , that came out loud and clear ..."
I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.  It's pointless.  I couldn't have cared less about the characters or the story.  I read a number of reviews comparing this to Gone Girl.  Not even close.  I loved that book.
"This was supposed to be a book with some dynamism, some action.  What a joke.  We have a self absorbed drunk women stumbling into a pit of despair.  Well get over yourself, dammit.  I want my eight dollars back Amazon."
"The book is much better understood than the movie that just came out.  In fact, one needs to read the book first to begin to understand the movie.  I gave the book 4 stars because the beginning was a bit boring."
"*No Spoilers*This book is a lot of fun. Lots of page turning, plenty of twists and a classic unreliable narrator. Good stuff.Rachel is an alcoholic and has lost her job. She rides the train all day to keep her roommate from knowing that she’s now unemployed. Her train happens to pass by the house she once owned with her husband, Tom. Tom is now married to Anna and they live happily in what was once her home. Rachel’s train ride through London is often spent tipping a bottle back. Seeing her old home and sometimes even catching a glimpse of the other woman, is enough to make her drink and drink she does. So much so, that what she sees is often not remembered later.That memory thing becomes a problem early on.Yes. It. Does.Rachel’s daily observances include a couple that she’s come to know as Jess and Jason, names she’s made up to give them substance. She watches them interacting on the balcony of their apartment, and she’s dreamed up a back story for them. But when Jess does something out of character for her, and then a crime is committed, Rachel takes it upon herself to investigate.As you can imagine, things get out of hand. Rachel sticks her nose into their lives and in the process, ends up involving her ex-husband and his wife. Both, really want nothing to do with Rachel but out of obligation, aware of Rachel’s raging alcoholism, Tom tries to look out for her when he can, which infuriates Anna.Tension mounts as the story unfolds and when you get to those last few chapters, you can’t help but turn the kids away, let your dinner burn, etc. The ending needs to be read uninterrupted. Don’t tell me that I didn’t warn you.But, honestly, Rachel’s antics were a little tiring. Just when I started to grow bored with her, some critical piece of info would surface and then I’d be flipping pages again. I suppose that’s a sign of true suspense because there was no way I was going to put the book down. I knew that from the start. Does it deserve the hype? Yes, I think so. If you pick it up for pure fun, you will enjoy it quite a bit. If you pick it apart and compare it to other books, you might find fault with some of it but really, who has the time for that?Read it, because it’s fun and it’s a great distraction from all the crap going on in the world today."
"It's a decent book, but not great.  It starts off very slow, but gets better in the second half.  There isn't one  likeable character in this story, so it's hard to care what happens to anyone, or have anyone to root for."
"It took me awhile to get used to the way this book was written, with it going back and forth with the characters and dates.  The book was cleverly written and organized and I was surprised with every twist.  I recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys a good plot with many clever twists."
"Interesting premise, decent execution. A refreshing change to have 3 main female protagonists who all have warts (although nothing in comparison to the males). The ""multiple viewpoint first person"" narrative (I'm sure there's a more technical literary name for this) is an interesting conceit but a bit confusing at first. In my view, the  story could have been told just as effectively by only two of the 3 narrators. Also one thing that gets missed in this format is any broader descriptive detail and explicit point of view on the evolution of modern British suburban society that lends itself to the rise of twits like these people (since only one of the 3 female narrators --and none of their 2 dimensional male counterparts--will admit to being twits as part of their narrative)The story itself could actually take place anywhere; needn't have been the Home Counties in the UK. However, compared to the mindlessness of the post-yuppie suburban twits we have in the US, these UK versions are pretty soft-edged, maybe even tolerable neighbors. Maybe I'll emigrate.The intersection of the personal narrative of the ""main"" protagonist and the mystery she's drawn into means there are inevitable missed turns on the plot roadmap. At one point I was flipping back through earlier pages thinking I'd either missed something or had inherited the heroine's propensity for drunken blackouts. Had this been a movie we would've commented ""hmmm, guess the last half of THAT plot line ended up on the cutting room floor.""All that aside, this was a decent read and a good diversion. I look forward to reading her next effort. also look forward to what I assume will be the inevitable film version of ""girl on a train"", which I think could actually rectify some of the plotting and narrative blind spots of the book. ) This book is being marketed as ""the next Gone Girl"", but in the right hands, I think a film version of this book could be so much stronger than Gone girl, which I thought had all the predictability of ritual Kabuki theater but with a suspenseful soundtrack."
Was excited to read this book but now that I have I'm not sure what all the hype was about.  I hope they tweaked the movie to make it better.  The jumping back and forth between time and characters was somewhat confusing at times because the first person narrative of the three different characters all sounded the same so sometimes one wondered who exactly was talking because they all sounded very similar.  I'm disappointed I spent the money for the Kindle version.  I don''t even know I would have been okay with spending $3-4 at the used bookstore either.
"We all want love. We all want acceptance. We all have wishes hopes and dreams. We all have successes, failures, pain.Rachel had Tom and wants to have her life back, the life she thought she had. Anna wants Tom so much she is willing to destroy a marriage. Megan wants to be wanted. Scott and Tom want to be knights in shining armor.  What is shame and guilt when we want what we want and others stand in our way?This novel will have readers reconsidering what is real and what is not. But not all dreams turn out as planned. Who is responsible for destroying our wishes if we are not?"
"An intriguing synopsis and rave reviews got me to read this novel... But the intrigue stopped there for me. I found this story hard to read because I simply couldn't stand the main character.  I found myself putting the book down on several occasions because she was downright annoying- I spent most of the book wanting to strangle her. I always finish books that I start (I'm completely type A that way) and although it took me much longer than it should have, I did finally finish this one; and I found that the end of it was truly the only decent part. It just wasn't worth the fuss to me... Subpar at best."
"After reading Gone Girl, I was excited to try another female-centric thriller. The book uses Gone Girl's technique of using different POVs, and unreliable narration which I love. The story is engrossing and characters well-developed.HOWEVER:The pacing gets slow towards the middle, and becomes a positive drag towards the end. You can't skip to the end because every chapter holds a little clue to the puzzle, so once you start you have to labour through.If you have a lot of time on your hands, go for it. If not, Save yourself and just watch the movie once it comes out."
"I have put off reading this book for a long time because of all of the terrible reviews. When I saw the trailer for the movie, it looked good and I forced myself to read it. I just finished and I cannot for the life of me understand why this is getting such terrible reviews. I thought it was really good. Don't let the negative reviews deter you. One review says they're not likable characters. Based on the subject matter, I don't think these people were supposed to be likable. I don't think all characters have to have redeeming qualities necessarily, though I do think a couple in this book do."
"Fast read, an engaging, contemporary mystery.  Good for folks who like crime solving.  Well written with strong character development and just the right number of characters. Liked the descriptive location development as well."
"I read a news paper review that suggested this book was comparable in some ways to Gone Girl. Baloney;  it should not be mentioned in the same paragraph.  Bottom line - kept wanting to quit before the end, but, like a looky-loo, I decided to see this train wreck to the end.  Sorry I ever started it."
"Excellent story telling. Pay attention to the dates, as the story does skip around a bit in time, but the narrative holds your attention and you wonder about what is actually happening versus what the protagonist sees. I liked the way it evolves into a mystery, and the latter part of the novel is fascinating how the author leads you into the reality of events from the inquisitive mind of our lead protagonist.."
"I usually never read for hours at a time.  But I did just that with Girl on The Train.  Solidly written, it keeps you engrossed to the end.  Pay attention to the dates of each chapter.  I kept having to check back.  Buy it, read it, have fun."
An interesting novel worth reading.  This writer found it a bit slow in the first third of the story being narrated by 5 different characters but as the story unfolds builds to an exciting ending.  The characterization is very real told as though the reader is actually in the mind of the character of the moment.
"THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A SOAP OPERA PRODUCTION. I KNOW IT IS A BEST SELLER, BUT SO IS THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER."
"(2.5 stars) Highly overrated, less sophisticated version of Gone Girl:It was an easy read and I was intrigued by the premise of the plot, but this book is highly overrated. Most of the characters are so unlikeable and disingenuous, it's almost laughable. I truly didn't care what happened to any of the characters. The story lacked suspense and I feel like the answer to the mystery was obvious 2/3 of the way through. Overall, it reminded me of a less sophisticated Gone Girl. (I had mixed feelings about Gone Girl, but I appreciated the story's dark psychology and attention to detail)."
"I saw the large number of positive reviews for this book and noted a comparison to Gillian Flynn and thought it sounded like an interesting read.  Wrong! I finally stopped reading the book when I found I didn't like any of the characters, particularly Rachel and didn't care what happened.  The book is written in such a chaotic way which made it hard to figure who was speaking and what was true.  The author was trying to be clever in her delivery but seems to have lost her way in making her characters people who seem real.  Darn, a real waste of my time."
"Given the notoriety of the novel, I was expecting at a minimum a well-crafted mystery. The pedantic parallel structure to Gone Girl is trite, and the vocabulary usage is sub-par (I read on a kindle and highlight words that require look-up and there were none in the whole book.) Additionally, the femme fatale has almost zero likability and does little to earn sympathy from the reader. The most interesting character is either the roommate, the victim or possibly the train itself."
It's probably not a good idea for me to review this book. From the fact that it is on the best seller list shows how well received it must be by readers. I personally found it very well written but much too dark for me. I was depressed the entire time I was reading it. The character doesn't have a redeeming quality. She's a falling down drunk and makes no attempt to help herself. How her friend could have been so patient after she threw up in the foyer didn't ring true to me at all.  I think for many people that would have done it.
"I don't know what the big deal is. Was okay but found all characters pretty unlikeable. The women are all under-employed and depressed and the men are all angry and prone to punching walls. And they're all cheating on each other. Weird bunch. The book is better than the movie, though. If you're looking for suggestions, take a pass on both unless you're the type of person that thought 50 Shades of Grey was great literature. In that case you'll probably like it. Nobody gets their bottom spanked, though."
"Blasted through this book in two days despite not liking any of the characters, all of whom have no moral compass at all. The protagonist is terribly flawed and the remaining antagonists lacking in depth; however, the pace of the book was to my liking and though I thought I solved the mystery half way through the book, I really was not overly sure of myself. If you like a suspenseful book with dark, depressing, self-centered characters, read the book."
"Clever book. Decent  read. I found the main character, Rachel  terribly  dislikable.  So I  dropped a star for that, as I skimmed several of her sections just so I could get to the end and learn what happened."
"I bought this book based on the glowing reviews.  I am trying to get into the book and each time I restart reading it, wonder what I am missing.  It is not a page turner but rather begs my patience.  I'm an avid reader, enjoy different genres, but Girl on the Train is a chore to read.  What did the more than 1,000 readers who gave this book a 5-star rating enjoy that I do not?I wish someone could enlighten me about this book's merits before I delete it.Thank you for anyone who is reading this.ML"
"It was just okay! Maybe because the book was hyped up so much, I expected a lot more. Instead I found it to be a bit shallow in terms of the plot and character development. It wasn't clear why the police kept on jumping from one suspect to another without really having reasonable leads or evidence... and why certain characters were introduced and portrayed the way they were (other than to mislead the reader). It was a quick read though... and worth reading if one is planning to watch the movie."
"Interesting story of relationships. What do you do when you drink so much you experience blackouts that block your memory. Do you question the witnesses who saw you stumbling as if drunk in the missing woman's neighborhood the night she disappeared. You admit you were there, but can't remember what happened. Can you convince the police you were on your way that evening to visit your ex husband who lives in the missing woman's neighborhood. What happened— if you could only remember.I enjoyed experiencing the difficulties the main character found herself stumbling through as she sought to discover the disappearance of a local woman and the many reactions she experienced because she was a drunk."
"I enjoyed this book and found it to be a very fast read. I liked the writing style, which was to the point and not filled with unnecessary detail. The more I read, the more I wanted to continue reading until the end. I give this book only 4 stars because I was expecting more of a shocking twist at the end, given all the hype about this book. I had the ending figured out long before it was revealed. Even with my disappointment at the ending, I would still highly recommend this book."
"so, I could not put it down, but it was so creepy, I will have nightmares forever...what was the author thinking?  And the bites inside the mouth??there were lots of typos, too..but I just had a train ride to DC and back, and this book ruined it."
"I initially read a sample and by the time I finished reading it, I had to have the entire book to see what happens. I used to take a train to and from work, and over time, there were things and people I noticed, and I imagined all sorts of scenarios for them, and subconsciously built rituals around different parts of my journeys.  Thus, the book resonated with me.  A well-written, psychological thriller.  I finished it in one reading.  Because I had to."
"Suspenseful but not the best writing I've ever read. I found the switch from one character's actions to the other, along with some writing faux pas to be distracting. Near the end, when the tension was building, the main character was described as sitting in an expensive, leather chair she had bought, but soon afterward she was described as being on the sofa. The author went to the trouble of describing the chair, but never mentioned any action saying the character had moved."
"It was a bit short and too fast. But the suspense was well worth it!  I found the characters well narrated during their own POV as well, the surroundings descriptive."
"Wow.What a great novel.What a brilliant concept.What great characters.Mundane, flawed, sorry, wicked, sad, aggressive and complex characters.This is a great whodunit, with chapters written from the perspectives of the three lead female characters. The tale is just so novel in its approach and so refreshing REAL. Not a single character is without flaws, but just so achingly imperfect that the story is anchored with intense realism.Highly recommend. I can't wait to read it again."
"I was disappointed in the ending. It was rather predictable; nothing extraordinary.  Prior to the conclusion/climax, I found the book suspenseful and I kept turning the pages.  The author's writing style is very different.  I was confused for the first 70 pages or so because I didn't know which character was speaking!(I have already read reviews of the movie coming out in October and, as usual, it is not the same as the book. It even introduces characters who were not in the book!)"
"I got this book based on so many people raving about it. I am 17% into it and the best part of the book?It puts me to sleep. I'm sorry--I could not get into this book. Could not relate. Had no idea what was going on. Delusional, selfish, self absorbed. Whatever. Did not like her. Did not care. I hate when that happens. I have to disconnect and not proceed. If anyone wants me to send it to you, let me know. I'm happy to loan it out. Give it away whatever.Good luck!"
"So hard to put this down. I especially liked the author's style, different from what is out there.Really makes you wonder about people."
I think it will make a much better movie then the novel .....I don't know why the movie producers don't make a movie about the novel Defending Jacob. It's a MUCH BETTER BOOK?  Read that one.  Sounds like a good premise to start with but for me it falls flat. A girl traveling on a train sees houses along the route and makes up stories about them ....she eventually meets them and the stories and the truth are quite different. Take a chance if you want to before the movie is released. Janet B.
Even though Rachel depressed me I couldn't stop reading this and I didn't know why. Then I realized that she was who I used to be in some ways. I was married to a very psychologically abusive man for almost thirty years before I escaped. So many of the negative things people said about Rachel explain why this kind of abuse is hard to escape. Nobody believes you. You look bitter and crazy. People say but look how fat she got. The abuser blames you and you and everyone else believes it. If you went to the authorities what would you say? He's mean to me? They would treat you like Riley treats Rachel. It's a horrible problem and I'm glad Ms Hawkins is bringing it to light!! Thank you thank you thank you.
"I was very excited to read this novel.  It was supposed to be the next 'it' book after Gone Girl.  However, when I completed it, I wasn't impressed.  The novel started great.  However, the culmination of the novel left a lot to be desired.  It hit a climax and then a chapter later it was done. I thought she could have ended the novel a little better, but the character development was phenomenal.  One good thing, there weren't any holes in the story, and I felt like she explained everything that needed to be answered.  I think if she worked a little more on the end of the book, it would have been better.  The end was the only thing keeping me from giving it another star..."
"I'm probably one of the few people who didn't enjoy this book.  It was definitely a quick read, so for that I did like it (quick beach read).  BUT i thought it was so predictable and the characters weren't developed at all.  Wouldn't waste your time on the book unless you want a quick, mindless read…ha which is why I actually read it."
"This Girl on the Train was a bit confusing at first because the story is being told through the eyes of three different characters: Rachel, Megan and Anna so the story seemed disorganized at first. The author, however, has a nice way of bringing the story together making the views of each character correlate with one-another. The plot was also really good and the ending intriguing right up until the very end! All in all, I definitely recommend this book!"
"Hawkins' novel has a great premise and a promising start.  But then her story flatlines--the same dull events that go nowhere are repeated over and over.  I'm puzzled by the great number of good reviews--this novel is not in the same league as Gone Girl at all.  The most interesting part was some of Megan's background story, but that's about it.  The narrator's story isn't compelling and the ending didn't reveal anything surprising.  Books like this are why I've recently switched to nonfiction, after being a great fiction reader for years."
"I just hate this!  A book so bleak, so frustrating, so downright sad, you want to close your kindle, shred your library card, demand your money back from the bookseller.  You can't.  The subject, the secrets, the tight, close to the bone writing style, grab you by the throat and insist that you read to the last brilliant word.Paula Hawkins.  Miss, Ms or Mrs.  Next time.  Give me bunnies, butterflies, balloons and blossoms.  Don't hurt my heart again."
"Very good book, that Tom sure knew how to make everything her fault. She tried to help Scott but that didn't help and he went crazy on her,  the wife finally did help, just all going on. I thought it was the wife that killed Megan at first because Tom was seeing Megan. Poor Megan after her experience with her first baby, now more grown up I think she would have kept the baby, she didn't want to get rid of it, but he was so mean to her!!!! At the end something about a warning, book #2?"
"At times I enjoyed this book at other times I was frustrated. It definitely is a good thriller and the plot twists were interesting and challenging. However, spending most of the book inside the minds of three extremely unrelaible narrators and having to wade through their thought processes was tedious at times. There was so much irrational/dysfunctional thinking! It reminded me of watching grade B slasher movies where the herione is always doing something stupid and you want to scream ""don't do that!"" As other reviewers have said it's hard to like anyone in this book except maybe the therapist (and even he made some highly questionable choices.) I can see why it's so popular though, because it is a page turner."
"What a bummer!  Not one to buy.  It's boring and under edited.  Could easily have been 40 to 50 pages shorter.  I got tired of reading the mumblings of the principal protagonist, Rachel, ostensibly the ""Girl on the Train"".  In reality she is a 30 something alcoholic with Korsakoff syndrome and no life.  It reads like a poor Daphne du Maurier or if you know Spanish a Corin Tellado romance for 14 year olds girls looking for excitement.  Compared to say, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Millennium Series) by Stieg Larsson, it's lemon fizz to his champagne."
"Even though this one kept me turning the ""pages,"" I couldn't wait for it to be over. Just tell me who done it and put me out of my misery, I kept thinking. The main character (the girl on the train) is that pathetic, depressed, nowhere-to-go-but-down person you would run from in a heartbeat were you to meet up with her on a ... a train, for example. I don't deny that there are plenty of her sort out there; i just don't find it enjoyable to follow the exhausting, circuitous, never-ending path to self-destruction along with her. Finally, spoiler? The end doesn't quite justify the means. All I'm sayin."
"Sucks You In -- once you start reading, you're trapped! What really happened? You can't stop until you know the answer! There is nothing ground breaking in this story in itself, it's the way it's told that makes it stand apart from the average. Each character's narrative painted a picture of who they really were, and written so well that you didn't want to stop reading even though none of the players were very likable. Well written and filled with subtle twists... Can't wait to compare to the movie!"
"I couldn't put the book down, yet found the story depressing. The characters seemed to have only sadness in their lives, no joy. It ended on an upbeat note, but I still wasn't sure who was going to make it and who wouldn't."
"I bought this book because people said it was comparable to Gone Girl. It is not. The suspense and buildup are fine but the storytelling is mediocre. Some of the characters were given back stories but these weren't all explained in the story. Gone Girl is so much better than this- the storytelling, the suspense, and the character motives."
"I wanted to like this book, I really did. It got great reviews, and I was excited to dig in. What a disappointment. I saw myself in some of the characters, but they became stupidly predictable and unrealistic. The whole plot was unrealistic, to be honest. I also had a hard time just getting into the book. I took frequent breaks while reading it because I just kept getting bored with it. Oh well."
An excellent read.  Takes a little bit at the beginning to figure out the characters and timeline but the stage is perfectly set.Very hard to put down and a compelling read right to the last word.
I really enjoyed this book. Usually I can figure out the killer but this time I was blind sighted. The author really keeps you guessing. She makes you feel a real empathy for the female characters. A good read!! Gwynne Gall
This was a really excellent book. I could barely put it down. The author did an excellent job of writing the characters' feelings and thoughts in a way where I easily identified with them and was able to feel their perspective like it was my own. Definitely a must read.
"I love to read dark, psychological thrillers, but I did not enjoy this book at all. None of these things would have happened to the character if she'd stop being a drunk. The only thing sloppier than the protagonist was the writing. I feel the character blacked out whenever the author couldn't think of what to write. Instead of weaving hints and subtleties throughout the book about the antagonist to keep you guessing and wondering, the author just decided her protagonatist got tanked (again) and she wouldn't write about the antagonist until the end then BAM you hear all about it. Lazy lazy lazy writing and a terrible way to bring in the antagonist. I never give one stars for books but I'd give this a zero if I could. Don't waste your time."
"I really enjoyed this book.  The characters evolved throughout the story. I found myself despising Rachel, then feeling sorry for her and finally admiring and cheering for her.  The mystery unfolds slowly and kept me guessing until end.  A very good read"
"The story is good. As a murder mystery, it kept me turning the pages. But I had a hard time empathizing with the main character (or any of the characters). They are so dysfunctional. Not one character has a redeeming quality. There is the pee-in-her-pants, vomiting, black-out drunk (protagonist), a misogynist or two, the shallow mistress who takes joy her house-wrecking ways and the victim, a manipulative hot mess who stopped mental development at 12 (figuratively speaking). I didn't care about any of them and I didn't like reading about them. I pushed through to the end to see if I nailed the murderer. That said, Hawkins writes well and hopefully, her next book will sport at least one likeable character."
"I thought this novel was immensely engrossing. I loved the original unreliable narrator, Rachel. The cruel realities of life that are sometimes glossed over in our politically correct society were firmly able to be displayed and revealed in Girl on the Train. Comparisons to Gillian Flynn are not valid, in my opinion, but every author is original and I like the originality of this book. I am glad my sister Jeanie recommended it to me. Of course I couldn't put the book down after the first half and stayed up reading really ruining my next day. Is there a word for this? Good Book Hangover, maybe?Well worth reading and buying and a great read."
"A fun read.  Definitely long on suspense, and enough surprises to keep one guessing.  It lost a star, only because perhaps I'm a bit dim, but I found myself a little confused with the author's jumping back and forth between the two main characters.  They are both speaking in first person, and at times, especially near the beginning, I had trouble remembering which character was speaking.  Still, it was a good story, and I'd definitely recommend it.  I can see why it is a best seller."
"I had a hard time putting this book down.Hawkins did a good job of interweaving the perspectives of the three prominent female characters in their words.She takes the reader down several paths, with interesting twists and dead ends before she finally reveals the villain.The alcoholism of The Girl on the Train is depicted in ways that realistically affect her life and create confusion for both her and the reader.Now, I can't wait to see what the movie does to this!"
"Rachel, an obsessive alcoholic who has blackouts, is struggling with life after divorce and sinking further and further into oblivion.  She becomes involved in a missing person case that she witnesses from a train and the case gradually takes over her life.I was torn between giving this book five stars or one star.  Why?  Because, while it's clever, it was excruciatingly slow to get to the point.  It is told in the first person, in turns, by three women, all s-l-o-w-l-y painting a hazy picture of a puzzle that isn't explained until the very last pages. It was extremely frustrating and a few parts were borderline boring.However, I was fascinated by the author's stream-of-consciousness style even in the present tense, which I usually dislike.  There is virtually no dialogue for the first 30 pages, just rambling thoughts. The pace definitely picked up toward the end and got really exciting.  Then, I was hooked and couldn't turn the pages fast enough to discover the very satisfying conclusion.There is a very small cast of characters, none of whom are very likable, and yet the book held my interest throughout.  Something different."
"This book was hard to sit through so I stopped reading it. While the mystery of it is interesting, it's the only reason I read as much as I did. The main character's alcoholism is a circling source of annoyance. I've never been so frustrated than by this drunk that cannot do anything to help herself. I eventually got sick of her and had to put the book down for good"
"Completely addictive. Like a British ""Gone Girl,"" this book took me on a roller coaster ride that I never wanted to end. Hawkins has created an indelible story that will stay with me long after reading the final words. I'm completely blown away and will definitely recommend this to my friends. Of course, there's going to be the inevitable movie made, but nothing can beat the versions of these characters in my head. The rich characters, the twisted story, and the specific setting all coalesce into a super intriguing and suspenseful journey. Read this book! I promise you won't be disappointed."
I am not one for writing reviews. I love reading though......I can go through about a book a week.  I had taken a break from reading for a while and this is the book I purchased to get back into it.  I'm sorry now that I did.  I certainly don't want to say too much in case you end up getting this but I sure can't recommend it. It was just hard to get through and not believable in the least.  That is not always important when you have a good story but that was missing too and even sadder still was the fact that every character in the book was a nut case.......it's not like I really cared what happened to any of them. Bottom line: Save yourself some money and pick out a different book.
"I got sucked into this book because there are such obvious details being left out that I wanted to know what happened next. As it would turn out, the suspicion I had within the first few chapters of where the book was going was spot on. Yes, I cared about knowing what the ending was. At the ending, though, I found myself not caring what happened to the characters. The plot could have twisted in a way to make at least one of them likable but in the end it just felt like a soap opera that I wished would be over already. Maybe good for beach reading, but don't waste valuable time on it. I stayed up 2 hours past my normal bedtime reading it and I wish I had those hours back in the form of sleep."
"I like to find something ""likeable"" about the main character(s) in the books that I read.  There was absolutely nothing likeable about the main character.  She had one thing in her life that didn't go as planned so she fell apart.  We all have events in our life that didn't go as planned we don't all fall apart (yes, some people do).  I do get the appeal of this book - the ""who done it"" factor but with such a pathetic main character I struggled to finish this book (a book club selection)."
"I admit that I’m no expert when it comes to this genre. In fact, as to date, I have only read three books including this that falls under this category, so I will have to base my review on the general impact of the novel to me to the best of my ability.In my personal opinion, this book passes the mystery-thriller-suspense-crime criteria with flying colors! What makes me say this has a great deal to do with the hypnotic writing style of the author- there is something eerie but magnetic with it and it is a huge mystery to me how the author is able to put across layers of meanings in the simplest thoughts and the most mundane phrases the female characters who are also the narrators utter.It is also noteworthy how the author, in order to craft this forbidding tale, deftly chose these three women who are most flawed and most foolish and yet are unexplainably capable of receiving the reader’s empathy. Of the three POV’s, I was most glued to that of Rachel’s (the major character) whose loneliness seems to magnify her imagination which consequently becomes the core of the plot.It is also quite impressively baffling that the plot seems both linear and rounded at the same time. I felt like nothing happens so much but at the same time, it also felt like everything is happening and unraveling right under my nose and I couldn’t control my heart from hammering against my chest. There were times I had to stop reading and allow the creeps to surface above my skin."
"I've had this book and in my library for a few months now. It was recommended but I just wasn't feeling it. A friend was starting to read it, so I thought I'd join her and we could talk about it. Well I started on a Monday and finished on Wednesday! It's one of those books that you have to pay attention to the details, the dates, the names, etc...  It was an easy read, kept me on my toes and suspense filled. Excited to see what they do with the movie."
"Great book!  Slow start, seemed a bit stereotypical, but it quickly switched directions.  Found myself talking out loud to the book at times, could not believe some of the twists and turns.  Very complex characters, somewhat dark, very suspenseful.  I would highly recommend this book to people who like suspense and well developed characters."
"Great novel to read by the pool, which is just what I did today. I caught the twist earlier than I was supposed to, but it didn't ruin the outcome for me. Being American, I liked the small differences in the language. Otherwise, the  story could have taken in Anyplace, Anywhere. The trains add an nice change of scenery. I'm rambling, but it's so hard to write a review like this without spoilers. Bottom line, I enjoyed this book and will recommend it to others!"
I really thought the book was going to be better. It was very slow moving and with each chapter being told by one of the three main female characters was confusing. It was long and drawn out. The book for me took off in the final three to four chapters. But I had to read many chapters before that before getting to the best parts of the book. I am not sure I would recommend this book to anyone. I would say just go see the movie instead
Great mystery with an interesting story line. Rachel appears to be an unusual character initially but then as the story developsone realises that she is a product of her life experiences.This book was chosen for our book club and everyone spoke positively about it and enjoyed the good read.
A great story well told.  The author has a gift for using simple words to express her thoughts.  She is a bit wordy but all a part of what she was trying to give us - the thoughts and feelings of each key character.
I found the lead character was an alcoholic stalker who needed serious help. She should have been reported for stalking a long time ago. That said life is full of people like her and the other weird abusers unfortunately.The book was nothing like I expected and I  did appreciate the style it was written in. Some of it was predictable with character personalities to who did it. I guess my rating is due to expecting more from all of the hype it got.
"I did not enjoy this book at all.  Chapters are written from the perspective of one character at a time and the timing jumps all over the place.  The story is told from over the course of 3 years but jumps back and forth during that time and is not well written.  This is not a book that is suspenseful as portrayed by the synopsis.  Things that are mentioned and you think they will play a part in the book just disappear, never to be referenced again.  I had figured out who the bad guy was very early on in the book.  And the main character, Rachel, just makes you want to grab her by the shoulders and shake some sense into her.  If you like to read about weak women that can easily be lead by men, then by all means, read the book.  I read this because it was the choice for the monthly book club that I am a part of - I will now be deleting it from my kindle, never to be read again."
"There's nothing i can say that hasn't already been said!  You now why it's a best seller!  I honestly had not idea what it was about until I saw the movie trailer, and decided I had to read it.  I bought this as an audio book, and Rachel, Anna, and Megan are all read by different actresses.  Made my ride back and forth to work enjoyable (is that possible?)....I couldn't wait to get back in the car!!"
"For all the hype, reading this book was a disappointment. The lead character, Rachel, is so unlikable that was difficult to care about her or much else taking place. The other characters are shallow, cookie cutter figures. The x-husband, Tom, is hard to fit with the character he becomes at the close of the book.The book's popularity struck me as the result of very good advertising. There are a lot of better mysteries out there, too."
"Great read for my cross country flight, it's a page turner or Kindle tapper to be more accurate. I doubt much of the story or characters will stay with me for long except for the alcoholic Rachel. As with any mystery if you figure it out too early on the rest becomes tedious. For me that was the case with this book and then suspense turned into impatience. But on the other hand if I hadn't been able to somewhat figure it out on my own I would have felt it was an ""unfair"" mystery so all good in the end!"
I don't like the new format of each characters thoughts. Find it tedious!! I like Chapters so I am not constantly flipping back to reread a section.I read the book because several friends recommended it and it was on the best seller list. What a waste of time. Will not do that again. It was similar to Gone Girl which I did not like. Have learned my lesson and will not read any of Paula Hawkins books in the future.
"Loved the book and the twists and turns as the character develops and impacts those around her. I am glad the book was clean. The movie coming out with its previews looks jaded and dirty. If you are one of those who doesn't like raw sexuality, please don't let the movie previews stop you from reading this book, because it is not like the portrayal in the movie trailers. I hope the movie doesn't hurt the sales of this fine deserving book."
"Really enjoyed this book. Is the writing filled with lyrical quotes? No. Is the writing real and compelling? Yes. Not a ""happy"" story, but gripping and enjoyable. Couldn't put it down. Reading it a second time now."
"Very clever concept. I couldn't put it down and read it in four hours straight through, finishing up at 2 am. Rachel is a mess, but that adds to the suspense and I think a lot of women who've ever been cheated on could identify with her, and with most of the female characters at least on some level, no matter how dark and messed up they can be. Overall, I thought it was well worth my time and money and I'd read it again."
"I forced myself to read this book. I had heard so many rave reviews about it that I had to buy it. I couldn't finish it because Rachel is such an unlikable character and I could not relate to her at all. I wanted to continue reading it just to see if it got better, but once my Kindle lost its place I gave up. I had hoped for a book similar to Gone Girl which I instantly loved, instead I found myself ruining my favorite hobby by trying to read this book. I definitely do not recommend it."
"Because of the comparisons I will say that I very much enjoyed Gone Girl. This book, I did not enjoy. I broke down and purchased it for Kindle because it was mentioned so frequently by friends and family and the waiting list at the library was pages long. I figured it must be good and all the reviews raved about it. I found it to be boring, slow, and unrealistic. For a book about observations and where a train is the main and most frequent setting, there really was not a lot of description. Each chapter is the same, Rachel takes the train, Rachel gets drunk. Anna's view did not really add anything in my opinion and Megan keeps everything a secret, even in her own head. The twists were not surprising or that interesting to me. Most things and extra characters seemed set up just to serve as red herrings, which does not work when it is obvious. Most of the plot happens in the last 30 pages, the rest is just 300 pages of her riding the train and not remembering anything. I mostly felt frustrated that the story wasn't going anywhere and when it did go somewhere it was pretty predictable. Maybe it is my generation, but I don't find infidelity that shocking."
"I am sooooo tired of reading about miserable, needy, narcissisti women.  Only one minor character had any redeeming qualities.  Not particularly well written either.  Cannot figure out why this is a best seller."
"I have lost sleep finishing this!  Time I can't have back:).  Three women taken in by abusive men.  Women are more intelligent than that on the whole!  Rachel's alcoholism and vomiting is exhausting for the reader.  Anna is a pathetic and a dim wit, And the murdered chic was a tramp!  I prefer books with stronger women<f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+00AA><f0><U+009F><U+008F><U+00BB>"
"Interesting plot, good writer, I could feel myself in the story, I am one of those that notices things going on around me.Although I no all have the imagination of the girl on the train. Makes one think about how alcohol can ruin your life!"
"It was really hard to get into this at first. However after ploughing through the initial 30 pages or so it got interesting. I can't say that it totally surprised me and blew me away but, it did keep me locked in wanting to know how it all ends. Will I read this again? Maybe not. Once is good enough. Would I recommend it? Sure! It's definitely a good read."
"The story started slowly and was confusing because it kept changing characters.  It was written as each character was telling a story from their point of view.  I kept reading the book because it did become more interesting as the story progressed.  The ending pleased and surprised me, it was a mystery that I never would have thought about."
"A smart, taut thriller that lays down lots of twists and does keep you guessing until the end. Notable for its structure as a series of internal monologues by three key characters, which helps develop their personalities and motivations much better than a typical omniscient-narrator style. Hardly going to change the world as we know it, but it's a good, suspenseful story that is worth the time."
It was not as good as I thought it would be.  The story just dragged on with this drunken woman trying to piece things together.  I finally found out who the killer was at the very end.  I would not recommend it.
"I loved the story and the ending but the writing style was slightly confusing at times. I liked that it was written in the first person, just wished it didn't jump around as much. Overall, though, great story!!"
"The ""Girl"" is a flawed character but she develops the will and the need to follow through on her suspicions.  I didn't know which character was speaking sometimes, so that required attention.  The plot reveals that it takes time to know and understand the depth of people's character, what's below the surface.  That's when this gets interesting."
"This book is outside of my usual genre of classic literature, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by how well this book is written.  It is cleverly done, keeps you guessing, gets you very attached to the characters, and has a twisted ending.  I wish I could find a whole bunch of books as good as this one to have to look forward to reading every evening."
This book is so good. It swoops you right in from the beginning. The characters are well rounded and easy to become engrossed in their individual stories. The story itself is a tornado of what-the-heck! I would recommend to anyone who likes to feel like Dorothy from wizard of oz while she's spinning and is in between oz and Kansas.
"This is hands down, one of my favorite books ever. The plot twists are crazy and every single character gets their own personality. I am not going to spoil anything about the plot, but I would definitely recommend this book to anyone."
"I was torn on whether or not to read this book because I kept reading reviews that said the characters we extremely unlikable and that did not interest me. I finally began reading it because I knew that I wanted to see the movie adaptation.  So very glad that I invested the time on this page-turner!  As an avid mystery and thriller fan, I live for the unique twists these novels project and this particular story did not disappoint.  Even more excited about the film!"
"I am a published author, a voracious reader and I say The Girl on the Train is one of the best novels I have read in recent years. The story itself is a unique and daring story, but it is what  this author does with that story that makes this book stand high above most writers. Planning to read a couple of chapters and then return to my own writing, I literally could not stop reading. That's rare for me. I'm able to put any book down.The author writes us into a relationship with each character, whom we feel we know, especially Rachel.An amazing novel. An amazing writer. An amazing literary career ahead!Joyce NormanAuthor"
"A very dark story  -- you'll read it quickly. The red herrings keep you guessing (and worrying) until the end. You don't know if you'll ever know what really happened until the very end. You do get answers and come to understand the characters. If you've ever wondered if you are alcohol dependent, this book might get you to sober up! The characters are well written and you learn about them because of what they do -- not because the author says this one is selfish or this one is generous."
"I tried to read ""Gone Girl"" 3 times and never got past the 2nd chapter. I kept falling asleep. I watched the movie, and other then Rosemund Pike playing a psychopath amazingly, it sucked also. A friend recommended this book as the remedy. It reminds me of something one would watch on the ID Channel so it was realistic to and I couldn't put it down. I read it in 3 evenings. I did feel that Rachel's whining was redundant, but understandable as she's an alcoholic. Overall, I totally recommend this book. It was a real page turner."
"A great and easy read to get wrapped into.If you have a blizzard taking over your Saturday and the only thing on TV is apocalyptic new reports then I highly suggest downloading this book and jumping in. It was fun from start to finish. My only reason for not ratting this book higher was that it really begins to slow down in the final 100 pages. I was starting to get anxious that the book would end before the plot wrapped up. Finally in about the last 50 pages it all comes at you so fast that you're left thinking, "" what! that's all!!?"""
This book was a struggle to read.  I almost quit twice and I wish I had.  So much deceit.  The ending is gruesome
"It was slow to start and I had to pause to remember the names of the characters plus the made up names, but at about the half way point it began to get more exciting and the plot became more involved. The ending was not expected. I enjoyed the book."
"Honestly it took a little bit for this to really get going I feel.  It did keep me guessing until the end about who the bad guy was which I enjoyed, not being able to easily figure everything out.  I also like that Rachel wasn't the easiest character to like, her actions at time made her appear pathetic and you just wanted to shake her.  It's not often you find an author that can write a character that you don't always like but still write a good book.  I also liked the alternating view points that let us into each women's world and let us see that Rachel and 'Jess' aren't that different.  All in all I would recommend this book, especially if you like thrillers that will keep you guessing until the end"
"I devoured this in one setting, I could not put it down. I can see the comparisons to Gone Girl due to the unreliable narrator aspect of this novel. Here there are three: Rachel the black out drunk, divorced hot mess; Anna, Rachel's ex's mistress and new wife; and Megan, the neighbor that Rachel has developed an idealized life, that has more than her own share of secrets. It took about 3/4 of the book for me to figure out who the real sociopath was in this novel, but it was an excellent journey. The writing is great, the story fast paced, and all three narrators are complex, multi-dimensional women. If you like thrillers or who-dunnits, you should definitely read this. I cannot wait for her next novel."
"Perhaps I could complain that the story started off slowly, but really, the only complaint I have is that I've never read anything by Paula Hawkins before. Her character portrayals are spot on and the simple complexity of the story kept me (metaphorically) turning pages at an ever increasing rate. Ultimately I found myself admiring the bravery of a woman I felt contemptuous of merely pages before. The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is that one character just seemed ""off"" to me; not really believable, although I wanted to.....Read it! Of course, you've already it. There's no surprise why this book has been on the best seller lists. It's just so good."
"It's been a long time since I've been able to finish a book because the author seems to lose me in the middle--if not at the beginning. This one though, kept me hooked til the end! Can't wait to see the movie, by I can't imagine it topping the book."
"Not exactly great ""literature"" but once you make it through the slow beginning it opens with, you are along for the ride of a woman who thinks of herself as an alcoholic loser who bumbles into a mystery that she can't let it go.  I highly recommend this book for good old fashioned escapism and entertainment. You will find yourself rooting for this appealing, loser as she tells the story that unfolds in present time, first person narrative."
"How often do we wish something we imagine is true? And how often do we think we know, but are really imagining something? Here we have three women with each having her own wishes and knowledge. Figuring out what is true and what is only imagined gives us a fascinating study of wishes and lies. Are these women any different from people we know or even ourselves?An interesting read with perhaps lessons to be learned makes this book well worth your time."
"Sometimes a book is enjoyable because the author displays a prowess over the twists and turns of the plot, you keep guessing at whether certain words and phrases are clues. And sometimes the use of language stops you in your tracks, and you read the words over and over, swimming in their meaning.  Or sometimes a book has a message, perhaps about whether what was lost was ever really truly in your grasp.  And sometimes Mr. Magritte, a cigar is really a cigar."
This was a great story though some parts are hard to read. The construction of the story keeps things interesting and makes for a quick read.  Good characters and a good twist at the end.
I think the author did a very good job of creating solid dimensional characters.  The stories were interwoven nicely and believably.  Her writings conjure up comprehensive imagery. It was a page turner... it was hard to put down... it kept me guessing until the very end. My only constructive critique would be that the conclusion could've been a little more finessed and tying up all of the loose ends. I am glad I read it! I would recommend it...it's a good read!
"I won't review the plot because I hate it when reviewers do that.  You all know the gist of the story.  As I was reading it I was thinking Gone Girl again and I guess many others were thinking the same thing.  None (and I mean none) of the characters were in even the slightest way likable.  I finished the book because I wanted to know how the author would bring this to an end, but not because I felt it was a good book.  It was rather painful to read.  All I can say is if you want to read it, go ahead, but for me it wasn't an enjoyable read. It was more, read it because everyone else is, and my book club picked it and now I can say I read it."
"This is an excellent whodunnit - of the type where you flip each page on to the next entry - it is a bit reminiscent of 'Gone Girl' and much of the story is a drunkalog , but it has some magic to it. In all fairness, each of the three women sound like each other. And the sudden conversion of the main character is more suspension of disbelief than I can muster. But she, like the cavalry, appears in time and rides to the rescue. Grab a cold drink, swing your legs in the water while you delve in to 'The Girl on the Train.'"
"I was not fond of this book because the characters were all such awful people. One after another, they were so messed up.  The book was redundant, yeah, we know Rachel is a boring drunk, we know Megan is a loser.  Both men are horrible!  I can't believe I finished the book. No surprises, since we already knew Megan was having an affair.  Duh.I know we all have our flaws, but I truly have never met anyone like these people.  Maybe I'm just lucky, or don't live in the bottom of a barrel."
"With the various narratives between three central female characters, the book has no problem grabbing your attention. But it begins to lag when Rachel's stupid decisions become tiresome. It's ok that she has flaws, being an alcoholic, but even in her sober right mind it's hard to like her because she's so pathetic and needy. Also it's frustrating when you've figured out the mystery long before the main character does. I was ready to be done when the killer started his: ""and now comes the point where I explain how I carried out my evil plan!"" monologue to the main character. It felt incredibly 1 dimensional and stale."
"Couldn't put it down!  This is a real page-turner... and after I finished it, I kept mulling.  It's the sort of mystery you keep trying to solve in your head as you read it.  Main character so well developed it you want to quit drinking."
"For two months I've toiled through this book trying to finish it. I finished reading it because over 40,000 people reviewed it and I thought it must have some merit. It doesn't... the book is predictable and the characters are weak. I would not recommend this book to anyone and found it a waste of time and money."
"I can't honestly say that I enjoyed this book.  I found a lot in it that made me uncomfortable, and since a read more for relaxation than personal edification or artistic pleasure I don't usually choose books in which the main characters are in such pain. That I said, the characters and the story developed in quite a creative way, and certainly it would not have been the same story if the primary characters weren't so uncomfortable with who they were/are. It is indeed a book worth reading. It is one of depth and substance, presenting issues prevalent in our society today. It gives the reader a lot to think about."
"If I hadn't been invited to a new book club I would have put this down at the prologue... I just don't like to read creepy stories and this one has characters so realistic and common it is haunting before it begins. I think female readers will see bits of themselves in Rachel, Megan and Anna and of men in Tom and Scott, even the ginger from the train. Excellent read. Wow."
"I enjoyed this book - it kept me interested, but all-in-all, it was just okay. It reminded me a lot of Gone Girl, which I liked better than this one. I felt it dragged on a bit (she's a drunk, we get it), but it was still suspenseful. I did guess (correctly) who the killer was mid-book, so the ending wasn't very exciting...it was just a confirmation of what I already knew. Would I recommend it anyway? Probably."
"It's been a long time since I've picked up a book and read it from start to finish. While the main character has many flaws and makes bad choices, I still felt like there had to be more. And I found more, a very satisfying read."
"I haven't read the other 900 reviews. I will just offer my own fresh perspective, unaffected by them. I think this is a fantastic novel. I am an avid reader of the mystery/thriller genre, and I have read so many books that I often have difficulty remembering them a couple of weeks later. For instance, I recently read Cain and Abe. A good novel by a fine writer, but I had to look it up on Amazon just now to remember what it was about. However, I will never forget The Girl on the Train. I would honestly have to say that this is the best piece of fiction that I have read in quite a while. It is totally unique. The premise is that a woman is traveling back and forth on a train to London. The track switching mechanism normally forces the train to pause in a position where the backs of homes on an adjacent street can be seen. The protagonist, Rachel, sees her own ""ex-home"", where her ex-husband currently lives with a new wife, whom he acquired after cheating on Rachel. Nearby, she sees what she believes to be the ""perfect couple"", frequently out on the terrace when the train goes by. Then one day, she sees Mrs. perfect kissing a strange man. The next day, Mr. Perfect's wife goes missing.Now Rachel is a serious alcoholic, and so it is not clear what is real and what is her imagination. She has frequent ""black outs"". I have to say that this author's description of the curse of alcoholism is dead on. You feel for Rachel, but you also disdain her. Why can't she just get her act together? It is all very complicated, and Ms. Hawkins masterfully handles all of that in the novel. I suspect she must know an alcoholic so as to portray their plight so accurately.So who killed Mr. Perfect's wife? And how and why? And was Mr. Perfect actually perfect? These are the questions that are slowly addressed as the novel goes on, with rising tension. Rachel does some really stupid things, but we are rooting for her at every turn. The downtrodden, drunk ex-wife who just wants to interject herself into the lives of a couple she only fantasizes about based on what she has seen outside the window of a train. The train is central to the novel. It gives it form. Every chapter is a date and a time, ""morning"" or ""evening"", coinciding with the commuter train to and from London. It sets the pace of the novel and helps to create tension. It is unique in this respect. It is a voyeur story, initially. And that sucks you into the story.There are a lot of twists and turns in this novel. I guessed who the murderer was at 61% (Kindle), but I couldn't have guessed the final outcome of this excellent novel! I can't recommend this highly enough. This is a MUST READ."
"Just finished reading this book and thought it was very Good!  A bit hard to follow in the beginning as it jumps back & forth between characters but once you remember who is who it becomes a little easier & a faster read.  Ending was a bit surprising.  I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie, which I understand has been ""Americanized"" by taking place in the U.S. instead of Europe.  I definitely would recommend reading."
"I thought this was a great story.  I really did.  I tore through this book to see what happened next and to find out whodunit. However, I'm glad it was a short, fast read because if I had to spend any more time with any of those characters, I was going to shoot myself. These are some of the worst people I've met in a book--or real life, for that matter. The most irritating was the one we spent the most time with, Rachel.  She's not only unlikable, but painfully pathetic.  She's a person with whom I'm very glad I don't relate.  But, for me, having at least a little connection/relation to the main character enhances my enjoyment of a work.  I hated Rachel.  I hated all these people.  I felt no sympathy for any of them, not even the murder victim.  Also, there were several distracting spelling errors (not just British spelling differences, but actual errors) that I couldn't believe were missed by an editor.  This book is worth reading just for the story, but if you're like me, and you'd prefer to actually care about at least one of the characters in a book, this will annoy you."
"I typically don't read bestsellers, because I want to give my time to relatively unknown authors who are struggling to get their books into the hands of readers. However, my book club recommended The Girl on the Train and I didn't want to comply so I read it. OMG! I haven't put it down in the last three days and it took me three days only because of work obligations. There are so many reasons why I loved this book. First, technically it is superb! Second, the transition of Rachel is exactly how it should of been stronger, but still flawed. Anna, the one person she hates and desperately doesn't want to have something in common with now shares a forever bond. The book was exceptional! Congratulations to Paula Hawkins!"
"When I first began reading this book, I thought, that it was so dry, but as I continued to get further into the book and I started to imagine what Rachel, Anna & Megan looked like and it got to the point where I could not wait to get back to reading. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"Stupid book stupid story poorly written…last time I buy a book because it is a best seller….a four paragraph idea dragged out interminably….just terrible….author & publisher must have a great deal to their PR agency to get his turkey on the""best Seller"" list…."
"When I began reading, I didn't think I would finish. The style was not my favorite. I prefer third person, one voice. After a few chapters, I grew curious about the characters and wondered how the author was going to resolve the plot twists and turns. The characters were flawed and struggling but understandably consistent in their choices. This is a book for adults who like mystery and psychology."
"It was slow throughout the book.  Very hard to get into.  Some twists, but didn't enjoy it overall as much as people raved about it."
"Typical read time for me is one to two evenings if I love the book, a week or two at most if it's just ok. I have been working on getting through this novel for well over a month.  The story is disjointed and has no flow. Still not finished but it seems to be picking up a little speed about 3/4 way through. Ironically the characters and writing are good, it's the storyline which, as the reader, seems to fall short in catching my attention."
"When I started this book, I was excited by the main characters and the first person accounts of events. I love that the main character was an alcoholic and not your typical heroine. However, the last quarter of the book was so disjointed and incongruous from the first 3/4 of the book, including a complete overhaul of Rachel, the alcoholic, that it felt like an incomplete, cheap and rushed version of the first part of the book. Promising beginning, disappointing ending."
"I don't want to mis-direct.  However,  if you enjoy:  stories about people with ""problems"" that even you can't think of answers for, so you are hooked and want to find out if there are some answers;  that you have trouble keeping up with whose problems we're talking about but are determined to try to keep up;  but worry the story doesn't go in a straight line but you are so happy it's not you but the story; but keep thinking, maybe I should just chuck it and go fix a drink.  No, gotta stay with this weird, kind of intoxicating, wild ride; say naughty words, shiver just a bit now and then; enjoy something that really is ""golly"" some different, Grab-a-holt of this one."
"After the first twenty pages or so, I asked myself how much more pathetic could the author make the character Rachel. But there was method to this insanity as a murder mystery developed and Rachel inserted herself into its solution in the most inept ways.It took me a while before I realized it was written in the first person from the perspective of three different woman and that it was jumping from the present to a few months in the past. Once I got that straightened out, it started to make sense.The pace picked up toward the end and it turned out to be a well-written thriller. I wouldn't give it five stars because it dragged a bit, but it certainly deserves at least four."
"I am happy that you asked for my opinion on this book. Honestly, I had a hard time finishing the novel. The main character, Rachel was so pathetic that I got tired of reading about her alcohol problem. I need a story that is uplifting. So the murder, the bad dynamics between Rachel and her ex husband's wife and the continuous drinking condition Rachel was described as having, I was really getting disturbed by the book. I managed to finish it only because the murderer wasn't revealed till the very end and I was curious about that detail."
"Memo to all those of you who are healthcare workers who work a 7 on 7 off shift.  I thought I could read this on my breaks at work and maybe an hour at home,  I was wrong,  I could not put this book down and at 1 point contemplated calling in sick.  I didn't but I finished it and loved it.  So begin on your week off.  Don't worry about finishing it- you will have it done in the next two days.  I suppose like Gone Girl it has characters that are not very like able .  But the characters draw you in slowly and you reach a certain acceptance/understanding.  Great story and I recommend it highly!"
"It's been a long time since I read a book that I literally could not put down.  My mom recommended that I read this one, and I was not disappointed.  I took it with me everywhere!!  I did not predict the ending - not just who did it but even at the very end there is a secondary surprise.  Very good read!  I've seen some people ask if it's like Gone Girl, and I have to say it's nothing like Gone Girl.  (For the record, I like Gone Girl, too.)  Definitely read this book but get ready to be caught up in it!!!"
"It was interesting... It certainly gave insight into depression, addiction, illicit love affairs and deception in marriage.  The end was a little weak..... And rather predictable by mid way through the book.Having said that, it was interesting to read how the ""girl"" could make up entire lives for people that she just passed by for a few minutes each day, and you came away thinking that she really needed to get a life of her own!  I hope that she eventually did."
"I liked the book!  Although it's not a fast book, starts slow and progresses with more intrigue.  A lot of monologue.  But it is nonetheless very suspenseful.  I watched the movie while only half way through the book, which was a first for me.  I found that I didn't mind seeing the end of the story before finishing the book.  I knew that the book would be different and have more detail.  I read the book primarily through audio and enjoyed it very much!"
"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It's a fast read and well written.  I could not stand the main character.  A true alcoholic that wallowed in self pity with not self esteem or self worth.  Her constant phrase was ""I'm sorry"".  I truly have compassion for people, including alcoholics and emotionally challenged individuals, but this Rachel was a real piece of work.  That's my opinion of course.  The other characters weren't much better.  Adultery was a ""fun and exciting"" adventure; wife beating was part of the gig.  I know all this sounds terrible, but all in all in makes for a very interesting, thought provoking story that would be great for book clubs."
"I hate to say I got so intrigued by this one because it's basically trashy. Somewhat like ""Gone Girl"" (another piece of trash I'm ashamed I couldn't put down) but this one at least had two characters (Rachel and Anna) that weren't totally evil. Rachel was pathetic but somewhat redeemed herself, and Anna was really OK from the get-go - except (I won't spoil anything here . . .). Enjoyed the ""British angle"" and will see the movie - will be interested in whom they cast in the parts!"
I was very eager to read this book.  It was a thrilling and exciting novel.  I loved hearing the points of view of the different characters.
"It has been so long where I've picked up a book and have been immediately sucked in. This book had an amazing pace without the typical lag and filler too many writers feel the need to include in order to fulfill word count. This book was perfectly written and has  me guessing as to ""who dunnit"" nearly the entire book.This book has been wrongfully compared to Gone Girl. Gone Girl lagged, was saccharine in places and the characters were off their rockers. The Girl on the Train is a book that begs you still think of it even after you've finished the last page. It's a book where you want to read the acknowledgment page just to cling to the book for a few seconds longer."
"Read fairly quickly as I did want to find out whodunnit. Jumps back and forth in time which is slightly annoying but I can see why she wrote it that way.  I read on the Kindle and the chapter titles don't exactly jump out at you, so I got a little confused until I figured out that I needed to read the title of the chapter to understand who was speaking and when it was happening.  The constant drunkenness got a little tiresome. You really want the main character to stay sober but it's a fairly realistic depiction of the one step forward, two steps back of addiction recovery."
"I find it hard to believe this book is on ANY best-seller list - and has so many people saying it's wonderful.  It is not.  It's pretty bad, in fact.  But the author, or her publisher, must have found a way to work the ratings system so that people like me will buy it because of the good reviews.  I feel gyped, and now am more suspicious of reviews!"
"Why has this book been in the number one NY times best seller list for so many weeks is beyond me. It is boring, repetitive stories of this alcoholic woman, very depressing.Some kind of murder story that does not make a lot of sense. At t his point I am skipping but will go to the end. This has been a really waste of my money."
"This would be a good airplane book.  About 35 pages into it, I considered quitting.  Each chapter has the name of the character whose perspective is described in that chapter, which is necessary because the voices of the characters all blur together.  More than once I had to check the first page of the chapter to be sure who I was reading about.  However, since my book group chose it, I kept reading.  It is a compelling story in many ways, and the plot twists at the end are clever.  So, if you find yourself needing something that will hold your attention, it could be worthwhile.  If you want something gripping and very well written, read Susan Hill's Serraillier, which is first rate."
"While I admittedly have a low bar on much crime/suspense fiction, this may be the most overhyped fiction of my recent experience. There was not an interesting character among the self pitying, self destructive cast of this book who, when faced with a set of choices, always made the wrong one. I was often tempted to toss this book aside mid-stream but did not, somehow hoping there was something I was missing. Alas, there was not."
"Though not normally my kind of genre, I mainly read this book to see what all the fuss was about. Although I enjoyed it, I’m still not sure why it took off like a rocket. At about the 2/3 mark, I started to get annoyed with the heroine and wanted to shake her by the shoulders and tell her to pull herself together fer cryin’ out loud. But then I realized what Hawkins had done. She’d wormed her protagonist into my brain and made me care enough to get me mad. Then I started to appreciated the feat she’d pulled off and was glad I’d read it. Yeah...okay...maybe I get it now..."
"I just have to say that overall I think that this is a very well written story and it definitely had a lot of twists and turns that we all want. On the other hand, my only problem is that I feel like all of the main characters, Rachel especially, were completely irrational with nearly all of their decisions through out the whole book, and it basically made me want to hurry up and finish the story when I wasn't even halfway done because it became unbearable.I think that an interesting character has to be a bit crazy, but there also has to be a bit of sanity to balance it out, and i believe if the author had done that, then the story would have been a lot stronger."
My heart is still pounding from finishing this book. It is a very dark psychological thriller. I couldn't put it down. It is disturbing. If you don't like DARK books pass on this one. I wish I would have passed. The writing is superb. I liked the way the author told the story by everyone's perspective.  It is why I'm giving it 4 stars but don't be mislead by that. I'm glad I didn't see the movie. I wish I wouldn't have read the book.
"Took this book on vacation, and couldn't put it down until I finished it. Seldom does one get a mystery / thriller with action on every page, with engaging dialog on the non-physical chapters. Loved the book!"
"It took a really long time to get anywhere with the plot of this book, and honestly you could figure it out about halfway through.  I was told it starts slow, but honestly I felt like it stayed slow until the end, when the author randomly threw a bunch of events together and concluded the book.  It was entertaining at times, but overall just OK."
"Really disappointed after all the hype. The characters were all intellectually lacking and the alcoholism and pure foolishness of the main character detracted from the story. I really didn't want to waste my time finishing this novel, but erroneously assumed, given all the positive reviews, that it would get better. It DIDN'T!"
"The book starts out a bit slow in the beginning and becomes a little tiresome switching between three different points of view of three different characters. Each character has a similar depressed viewpoint and the repetition begins to wear down on the desire to continue to read the book. The ""twist"" will most likely become obvious to most readers earlier than author may have intended which will make getting through to the end a chore. Despite the comparison by others, this book is nowhere near as good as Gone Girl."
"Since this was one of this Summer's popular reads I decided to download the book and give it a chance. The premise seemed interesting enough so I started reading. I ended up reading the book in 2 days (in between working and relaxing on my couch). I really enjoyed this book and recommend it to those who are fans of Gone Girl (which I am not, but it is similar). I have friends who have read the book and they found the main character Rachel to be rather annoying, however; I related to Rachel so this was not the case for me but it may be for you. I would give it a chance and be prepared to be sucked into the story."
"I didn't really sense any ""suspense"" in this novel until I reached the half way point. I was annoyed with keeping track of chapters with dates, and there are three different female voices which makes this a difficult type of book to read on a Kindle. I almost quit half way through the book because I just didn't like anyone in the story. However, I'm glad I finished it because the author did eventually bring the story to a satisfying conclusion. I have read reviews that compare it to Gone Girl and it doesn't rise to that level at all. I think I would have edited out half the alcoholic stupors for Rachel because I just got tired of her reasons and excuses for being how she was. The book is simply Okay."
"Character development of Rachel was authentic. I wanted to scream at her, ""Don't do that!"" when she was in the depths of her alcoholic drinking and loneliness. The end was a bit pat, but it was a compelling read."
When I first started reading this book I didn't think I would like it The format was a little different Three women names list for different chapters but once I got started it sure kept me interested  only a few main character probably 5 or 6 and that all the author need good read
"I had seen the hype for the movie so i thought that i would read the book.  As it was billed as similar to Gone Girl, i had high expectations but was somewhat disappointed to figure out whodunnit about 3/4 of the way through.Anyway it was better than the average mystery novel so I would give it 4 stars"
"I was blown away by this psychological thriller, a debut psychological thriller at that! I was fascinated by the idea of this woman secretly spying on residents everyday as she rides the 8:04 train. People watching is fun, I enjoy doing it when I’m forced to be social, but the situation this woman involves herself in is far more complicated, and personal, than she expected. (And something I’m not motivated enough to involve myself with- bye Felicia.)Coming out of a rough divorce, Rachel finds herself at an all time low. She drinks to dull her emotional pain, she rides the train into town without a sense or purpose, and now she finds herself meddling in other’s peoples affairs- literally. As a former resident of Blenheim Road, she’s always watching as she passes by... Until one day, she sees something, within the blink of an eye, that kick starts an investigation she’s stuck in the middle of.Rachel begins her own personal investigation after the police have made it quite clear they won’t be listening to an unstable drunk. The case had me jumping to conclusions after each chapter. I wanted answers and wanted them now. I was desperate to read faster, to unlock another clue that would lead me in the right direction of solving the mystery.Hawkins wrote chapters from alternating points of view, revealing pertinent bits of information at the right moment. The minute I had an inkling on who the perpetrator could have been, something new was thrown into the equation and I’d be back to square one. Mad props on your trickster ways and skills, Paula.One of my favorite things about reading this genre is trying to figure out/solve the mystery before it’s revealed. (Movies, too!) It’s a trait I inherited from my dad. Books I can’t figure out/solve are always enjoyable; whether I’m reading and frantically turning pages as if they’re more important than air, or taking my time to absorb the details and take notes, they engulf me. Sleep is for the weak, I need answers.The Girl on the Train was a nail biter and I was hooked on the story the entire time. I look forward to future works by this author!"
"This book has been on the bestseller list forever so when Amazon put the Kindle version on sale for $1.99 I decided to give it a shot. Not going to deny I went into this with a little bit of a hesitant attitude because I doubted it was going to be my kind of book. It wasn't. I really thought it was terrible but I managed to hang in there until well past halfway. I was in the publishing industry for many years and have read many a book but few, maybe none actually, as overrated as this book.I'm obviously an exception because with the huge popularity most readers must have loved the book. Good for them, happy they got a return on their entertainment dollar."
"This is the first book I've read in a long time where, after I finished, I thought--wow. The author got me. She totally got me!! And now I want all my friends to read this too, to see if she will also get them!"

For a debut novel, it was a brilliant depiction of the most basic elements of fallen human nature--envy, greed, lust, deceit, all tied in with murder, emotional and sexual hunger, and obsession on a grander scale.I am thankful to my new favorite author, Paula Hawkins, for:1) Not giving us a Gone Girl ending, especially with all the main characters' aversion to truth. This type of unpredictability suited Gone Girl because of the utter vileness of the ''heroine,""and we know that life never turns out the way we want, and sometimes evil triumphs over good. But I think letting Rachel live and killing off Tom finally gave the reader some breathing room to say, ""Finally. Something goes right."" (Or at least that's what I say, given that I felt like I was reading the book on a fast-paced train with my pulse beating fast and heartbeat ricocheting in my chest.)2)Giving me a character I can relate to. Only instead of alcohol, I'm addicted to caffeine. I felt that Rachel Watson was somewhat of an extension of me. We're both curious, (need to know), we're both driven by a sense of doing what's right (if you see something, say something), although I don't know if I would have had the nerve to do what she did, we've both said our share of ""I'm sorry"" to people we love (after acting similarly), and we're both fat. Instant buddies for sure. Throughout the novel, she makes stupid decisions (just like I do), but I found myself feeling protective of her. I did not want her to meet Megan's fate. So thanks to Ms. Hawkins for giving me a new best friend.3). Writing a book with a potential for changing lives. At the core of this novel is this undeniable theme: We are all only humans. We have our successes, our failures. Our strengths, our weaknesses. We are individually different but together all the same. All of us have hope of redemption. Rachel was an alcoholic until she realized the value of memory over apologizing for things she doesn't remember. Anna liked being the homewrecker until she found out the train wreck her life had become with Tom's infidelity and her ex-nanny's betrayal. For some, redemption was too late. Megan and Tom wanted something they could not obtain in their own lives so they reached out to each other for a temporary pleasure, which inevitably costs them their lives. Though the reality of my life is nowhere nearly that drastic, I can honestly say that I am somewhat changed by the lessons in this novel. It has touched my heart in ways that only truly great literature can.Though I'm sad at the end of this journey and that I have to debark, I hope other readers will get the chance to ride this fast-paced thriller on wheels, accompanied by suspense and page-turning anticipation running through their fingertips."
"The Girl on the Train is yet another twist on the classic whodunit. The story is told through the point of view of three women, each with their own flaws and secrets. We meet Rachel Watson, a drunk, unemployed, divorcee who daydreams about the ""perfect"" life of Jess and Jason - a couple she only knows by seeing them from the train every day. When Jess (Megan Hipwell) turns up missing, Rachel takes it upon herself to solve the case. Through a series of lies and deceit, Rachel finds herself face to face with a cast of male characters (all deeply flawed themselves), anyone of whom could be the killer.My thoughts on the book:The writing style is just horrendous and completely unnecessary. The entire book is written in first person, though our POV switches between the three female characters: Rachel, Megan, and Anna. This can lead to confusion when the action flips back and forth. Had this use of first person worked to reveal something about the characters that could just not be said through third-person omniscient, it could have worked. But it was complicated by the fact that each chapter was broken into ""Morning"" and ""Evening"", so the tense switched back and forth between present and past tense. I get that breaking it up this way reflects the two train trips, one in to the city, one back home, but it is unnecessary as most of the action takes place off the train. These two combined makes it difficult to read.This is Hawkins' first novel, and it shows. The bland writing style bored me to death, and it took everything I had in me to finish the book. Stephen King can spend 80% of a book writing about nothing and I love every word of it. Hawkins drew out a boring story where we learn to hate every character involved. Not a single character has a good redeeming quality.I was genuinely surprised when the killer was revealed. I was not shocked, however, and this is a huge negative. When I read the reveal in ""Gone Girl"", I had to put the book down. I could not continue because I had to process what I had just read. I have had this happen in many other books. Good fiction is emotional. You feel shocked because you're so invested in the story and characters. Here, I was just glad it was over.Conclusions:I read this book simply because the movie is coming out soon and it was well known and liked. I was disappointed throughout, and expected much more. There are many things (see above) that could have improved this book. The plot was not bad, it was just poorly developed. The characters were not unbelievable, but they sure were unlikable. The style and prose were atrocious; nothing short of a full rewrite could have saved that.Read at your own risk. If being part of the crowd is more important to you than reading quality fiction, this is your book."
"From an older person's perspective, this book is rubbish. Full of the self-indulgent whingeing of an alcoholic and the ""want want"" self-obsessed sense of entitlement of the younger generation. I gave up counting the 'I wants' when they reached 100 and the ubiquitous 'I'm sorry' made it read like a Coronation Street script. It is not very well written either."
"I really enjoyed this book. For me it was a physiological thriller. The characters did remind me of the book Gone Girl, but I enjoyed that thriller also! The main character, Rachel is an alcoholic and has lost her job. She does, however, pretend she is going to her job and does so on a commuter train on a daily basis. Rachel watches the world from the window of the train including a couple who are frequently out on their terrace when the train goes by. She even gives the couple names! The woman who is part of the couple goes missing and Rachel enters their world. I was very absorb in this book and found it hard to put down."
"There wasn't one thing I liked about this book. All of the characters were cliche and unlikeable. The plot was not Hitchcockian, it was predicaable and tired. This could have been easily written as a short story.  I thought this book was a total waste of my time and energy. I have never been so anxious to finish a book. I read at a very rapid pace, but I found myself at warp speed just to start another book. Why would anyone want to make this into a movie?"
"Despite the fact that there is not a single likeable character in the story, we all have our demons and I found myself able to identify on some small level with the main character. For me, the book did not deliver on it's potential of a taut mystery with a ""didn't see it coming"" ending; instead the story was a bit clunky, messy, and all over the place, much like the main character. The writing style, however, was enjoyable and I would enjoy reading a tighter, more inventive story from this author. Overall it was an okay read for a couple days while I was taking care of someone post-minor surgery."
"I found this book to be extremely slow starting and confusing. You must be very careful when reading this book that you pay close attention to the dates and characters you are reading about.  This book flips from one person to another listing the dates and names of the characters in each chapter.  Many times I was going to stop reading the book but stuck with it.  It did improve after the first 100 pages or so.  I did finish the book, finally, but did enjoy parts of it.  The ending was not a surprise to me. Overall if you want a slow moving book in the beginning and gets better the more you read this book is it."
"I enjoyed the book. I have been looking at reading this for some time as it always came up on my feed as a book I would like. While it took me a few chapters to get into it , I found I wanted to go to bed early just to be able to read and read. The ending I found just a tad anticlimactic but overall a good book. I am anxious to see the movie even though I have read reviews about it not being as good as the book.. happens a lot!"
"This was one of those books that you may have a hard time putting down at night, and will likely end up staying up way too late reading! It's a great psychological thriller that keeps you guessing until the end ""who done it"". I thoroughly enjoyed the plot twists, and the antihero main character Rachel with all of her alcoholic flaws. You can't help but root for her as the underdog, despite her constant erroneous behavior. I'd highly recommend this. It has a bit of a ""Gone Girl"" feel, at least sort of similar to the mystery that the first half of that book held. Something to keep you on your toes."
"I am an extremely picky reader, I get so frustrated when I read a book and feel like it was not worth my time. This book completely sucked me in, I found myself sneaking in a few pages or chapters when I really ought to be doing something else.  As I was approaching the end, I was completely invested in how the story would turn out and would have been miserably disappointed if it had not been well done.  I was not disappointed, this was an excellent read from beginning to end. In addition to the storyline that keeps you guessing, this book has not one but three brilliantly written, complex women characters.  One of the best books I've read so far this year."
"A tedious beginning gives way to a so-so first third of this novel, making me wonder what all the fuss was about. I know that every book has a "" set-up"" portion, but this part could use some serious editing. There was way too much drunken rambling in Rachel's mind while she took her twice daily train rides to and from London. Thank goodness the last half slowly begins to build suspense, as I was just about ready to give up on this one.The story is told by the ex-wife, the current wife, and the victim, but NOT in chronological order, making it a little difficult to follow the plot line. I found that I had to highlight the dates so that I could keep looking back at them."
"So, it took me a long time to get into this book.  I found the main characters so flawed they were almost unrelatable, and it's hard to get engaged in a story where the main characters are just that unlikable.  BUT, the story had a really good last third.  It as thought-provoking in a much as when you hear from various characters' first-person narrative, you certainly appreciate how ""point of view"" is everything, and you can become sympathetic to even flawed characters."
This book was great. We as people truly don't know others as well as we think and hope. Paula Hawkins brings the TRUTH to the saying 'Don't judge a book by its cover.'
I finally read this to see what all the fuss was about.  I went in with high expectations and that probably played a part in my disappointment.  I found this to be a boring read.  The girl kept getting drunk and then racking her brain to try and remember what she did while inebriated.  Not the kind of suspense I find exciting.
"This book started slow but developed quickly. I myself have had issues with drinking, uncertainty  and confusion ....and this really worked as a representation of that.The mystery is fantastic gripping you until the end"
"I had a difficult time developing much interest in the frequent mental musings of the main character. difficult to distinguish what was ""real"" and what was being imagined. I was not interested in imagined plots and events and characters that she was constantly engaged detailing.for all I know the first half of the book was just a dream she wrote down.I picked it up again after a month with a fresh approach and the second half of the book is a bit better.I still haven't finished it and unsure whether I will have the interest or energy to try."
"I enjoyed reading this book. The writer does an excellent job of characterizing each POV character, so she clearly knows her stuff in that department. The plot was pretty straightforward, but I guessed the solution much sooner than I expected to (and, as it turns out, hoped to) in a book so highly lauded. After I made the crucial connection, I dutifully finished the book, but it wasn't nearly as fun. Cheers to the writer for completing a book that has garnered a good deal of attention and praise, but I likely will not be recommending this as anything more than a summer beach book. If you're looking for a way to knock off a few hours, you could do much worse. If you're looking for a thriller to challenge your powers of observation, you could do much better."
It's hard to decide if I like the book or disliked it but I wanted to get to the end regardless.  The women are very messed up emotionally and make me wonder about my life.  It is a hard read to wind through their mess of lives.  It's a believable and fantastical story.
"I'm flabbergasted by the rave reviews, especially that there are 17,500+ mostly positive reviews. At the 20% mark, I debated ending the boredom since nothing had happened yet. Once I got to about 50%, I was still bored and confused about what all the fuss what about because still nothing much had happened. But I slogged through and finished, and I'm still shaking my head. Not one of the seven main characters is likable. Most of them drink heavily. The pacing is slow and repetitive. The book felt so amateurish that I really question what has happened to the reading public that books like this and Gone Girl, another poorly written and over-hyped mess, are so popular. Are books with fully developed characters and carefully crafted plots too challenging for people? I just don't get it."
"Meh.  I wasn't very impressed.  While the story line was okay, I felt that it was predictable.  I think all the hype set me up for disappointment.  I felt that a lot of things were repeated, and grew tired of reading the same types of details used to describe the characters.  I thought it was interesting when the author went into detail about alcohol induced blackouts, but once again, mentioned it so many times, which played a part in the predictability.  The way the story wrapped up was especially jarring and disappointing.  it was unrealistic, and again, contributed to it's predictability.  its a short and somewhat enjoyable read, and many people enjoy it.  If you're looking for a book to jolt your senses, push buttons, or affect your emotions in any way, this book is not for you."
"Hmmmm - I loved the title and the premise of this thriller, but did not care for the character development (all characters seemed so alike minus the alcoholic Rachel).  Though the plot captivated my attention, it was a bit like watching a train wreck which needed to be concluded so I could move on to something else.  I can't recommend this due to the above, and am disappointed that the writer had such a great idea for a story, but failed to live up to the potential thus could not captivate this reader."
"When I first began reading this book, I thought, that it was so dry, but as I continued to get further into the book and I started to imagine what Rachel, Anna & Megan looked like and it got to the point where I could not wait to get back to reading. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"Loved it, read it in a day could not put it down. Brava, Paula Hawkins. You can weave a Web like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle! I am impressed,  I am a picky reader, but this was brilliant! Encore, Encore clap, clap clap. Loved it ate it up! Missing the characters already,  we'll not all. Keep it up, more please!"
"It is not the kind of book that you would want to make time to read it; rather it is good entertainment while you are commuting, waiting in the It line, or having nothing else to do.I have mostly read the book on the train - probably better this way in the first place. Five minutes now and then make me more emotionally and sympathetic connected to the main characters. But I feel a bit uncomfortable that is a book of how two women fell, stupidly and desperately for a bad, smart guy. I will be looking forward to a book that's the other way round - stupid boys fell in love with dangerous, smart and bad girls.Sorry that I am a lousy reviewer, but anyway - the book is good to kill your time, but don't get your hopes up."
"First off, I think there is somewhat of a ""herd"" mentality in the overall negative ratings by some reviewers of this book. With that off my mind...I see real value in the epiphanies each of the three female characters experienced within the unfolding of the story.Rachel literally rides the train and, to my interpretation, is  also, figuratively riding the train of alcoholism leading to some serious self delusion. She blames the failure of her marriage entirely on herself and carries the burden of the resultant guilt. She never saw her husband clearly. While riding the train into London everyday she invests emotional attachment to a young couple she observes in a house she passes everyday...so much so... she bestows upon them her own made-up names. Events in her own life and in the lives she is observing conspire to literally and figuratively make her get off the train. These events are suspenseful and make for a great storyline. Both Anna and Megan each have different self discoveries. The male characters do not seem to evolve and if anything, each one you meet shares culpability in the main event of the book.  Particularly odious to me (and he is written to actually smell bad) is Scott for his hyper aggressive selfish character; his bullying and his assault of Rachel. Just a personal observation and opinion.Careful reading of this book will yield many clever literary devices. The fact that there is not one smile described as genuine from joy at its root in the whole book.""Everything about him is warm—his hands, his eyes, his voice—everything but the smile. You can see the killer in him when he shows his teeth.""Another is the symbolism behind the small pile of rocks in the corner of Megan and Scott's garden.It is not written as an intense suspense narrative with accelerated pacing and should not be compared with such.  It is written more like a jigsaw puzzle with the pieces to the puzzle locked inside the seemingly blackout mind of the ""Girl on the Train"".  For a satisfying literary and emotional experience and challenge, I highly recommend this book."
I could not put this book down once I started. (I read it in a few days -- that's how good it is!) It is full of twists and turns. I love that each chapter is narrated by a different character. It was a bit of an easy read for me but still kept me on the edge of my seat. Every chapter I would change my mind on who I thought the killer was.I would definitely recommend to those that love a good thriller. Can't wait for the movie!
This book was just painful. I tried several times to read it. When I realized I was forcing myself I quit. Books are meant for enjoyment.  I could not get into the main character.  She was such a mess and she was just depressing. Nothing to draw you into her world. Not sure if it was the character development or writing. I finally scrapped it after numerous attempts and making it through only 7%. I don't generally like reviews that haven't read but this book was just so blah I felt compelled to warn others before spending money. There are so many other great thrillers to read.
"Absolutely horrible, very poorly written, and the worst book I've read in a LONG time! No character development or plot development in a book that starts, ends, and in between goes nowhere.  I found myself reading nothing but ""blah, blah, blah,"" most of it irritatingly repetitive. Many reviewers say the ending was not satisfying. I disagree. I found the end immensely satisfying, for it meant I completed the tedium and could now go onto something more rewarding, not a high bar compared to this piece of garbage."
"While the book is reasonably well written and entertaining, the main problem I have with it is that the 3 female character, 1st person point-of-views are so much the same voice. Writing in the first person gives the story immediacy, but I had to keep checking by chapter name who was who. The psychology and voices of all three characters were really so similar. If this 1st person technique weren't being employed I would say this is really one character dumped into plot threads. In fact what drives this novel is plot reveals and manipulation of the reader. That's okay if it is wed to deepening characters where the nature of these people and caring about what happens to them is as relevant. It read more like the author cared about these characters but they were only pawns in her game. The self-revelation for Rachel at the end is one of the nice ideas of the book."
"Rachel is fat.  Fat fat Rachel.  Rachel drinks.  Drinks, Rachel, drink.  Rachel is unlikable.  Poor, poor Rachel.  Add in ex-husband Tom, who is shown to have about as much personality as paste.  New wife Anna, who slept with Tom while he was married to Rachel, and seems to exist primarily to whine about Fat Rachel (and Anna can't seem to think of Rachel without saying that she's Fat).  Scott, who sleeps with Rachel even though she's Fat and his wife has been murdered, and Megan, the murdered wife who has a history, but again no personality.  And finally, Rachel's roommate who exists solely to complain about Rachel's drinking.Dull.  Tedious.  You don't care about any of the characters.  And you can't really guess who dunnit as there are so few clues.Ah, well, if cured my insomnia for a while."
"The premise is great. An ex wife (Rachel) rides the train each day on the way to a job she no longer has because she was too drunk to hold on to it, or hold on to her ex. One day riding the train, passing behind the house she used to live in with her ex, she sees something two doors down at the house where she has created a fantasy backstory for the couple who lives there. Then the neighbor, Jess/Megan goes missing. The story is told in chapters of alternating voices: Rachel, the ex-wife of Tom; Anna, who marries Tom next; and Megan, who lives two doors down, gores missing, and is not what she seems, either. In fact, nothing is as it first seems. What happens to Megan?  Who is responsible?  About three quarters of the way through, I had a pretty good idea. The book reaches a slow climax and then unravels predictably because the author leaves big fat clues everywhere.  Nothing subtle here."
"Finishing this book became a chore for me about half way through.  The ending was dull and I felt that most of the story didn't tie in much.  There are several narratives, all unlikable.  It tries to be a suspense, but I was bored. You could read the first few and last chapters and not be missing much.  I felt like the author was adding fluff to make a short story into a book.  Honestly I feel like it is super overrated and taking a ride on ""Books similar to Gone Girl"" bus."
"I had added ""Girl On a Train"" to my summer reading list, and was anxious to start it.  It was high on my list - right after Orphan Train and All the Light We Cannot See. I had no preconceived ideas about it and did not know the story line. Given the number of great reviews, I was pretty shocked when I was halfway through it and simply not engaged. I could have put it down and not returned to it. I get the theme of ""these-characters-aren't-who-you-think-they-are"", but how many chapters of the main character's obsessive screw ups, alcoholism, mental instability,  and self-loathing do we need to witness before thinking the author doubts our comprehension and needs to repeat it for us?For awhile, the most interesting part for me was the momentary supposition that Megan and Rachel were the same person due to MPD - at the same time knowing the impossibility of that considering the cross-over of people in both their lives. By the time the author fleshed out Meghan's background issues - I just didn't care. It had taken too long and I just didn't care to pick up the [new] baggage of Meghan's self-loathing after spending half the book watching Rachel embrace her pathetic-ness.I don't know if one would consider it a ""disclaimer"" but I have a degree in Criminology, so I may be more pragmatic in my attitude. I read a lot of mystery/thrillers and feel I am easily engaged and don't tend to over criticize.With that said, (and trying to avoid spoilers) - I thought the perpetrator was obvious early on, based on actions and history......not conversation and pretenses.  And come on - the ""nanny scenario??""  Seriously""Normally, in a thriller or mystery I really like - the characters are woven with a complexity that involves me. Later on, it should be a surprise regarding who they really are. Quite simply - I didn't want to know any of these people."
At first I was very confused because it went back and forth from character to character and different timeframes. I actually started the book over again to try and get it straight.  Once I got it straight it kept my attention page after page!!  I would definitely recommend this book and I can't wait to see the movie!
"I enjoyed reading this book and I was surprised by the ending. That being said, when the author doesn't develop the antagonist, the twist is expected. All the females were interesting but I wish the author had developed the men's characters in the same way."
"...then read this book. Otherwise, skip it. I promise. One day, I will find the person who took the bribe cash to get this $16 cinder block onto the NY Times Bestseller List, and I will not allow them to get away from me until they are able to recite the definitions for ""Hitchcockian"" and ""psychological thriller"" from memory.The writing is stilted, the timeline is funky, the flat characters are pancake flat, and the main and round characters are written just well enough to keep you from beating your face in with whatever vehicle is carrying this work to your unfortunate retinas. If anything, this book made me wonder what type of activities the author had time to engage in while writing it, because she clearly wasn't working on any kind of character or plot development."
"I have no problem tossing a book to the side after a couple of chapters if I don't like it. This one I wanted to throw across the room! I just can't understand the good reviews, but I had to keep reading to see if I could figure it out. I never did.I tried skimming once I got halfway through, but it wasn't easy. The book is told from the point of view of different characters but they all sound the same. Not to worry, you know you're reading about the main character if she is constantly worried about her next drink.This trend of going back and forth, writing chapters from the perspective of different characters and at different times (which she also does) can be the mark of a lazy writer. It takes time to create a single narrator, and I don't think this writer had the skill."
"Using multiple first-person POV (point-of-view) is a great strategy IF those voices are different enough from each other that they add value to the narrative. In this book, the characters are really not distinctive enough from each other to necessitate the use of multiple first-person POV. I think it slowed the plot down and didn't add much to the telling of the story. Also, you have to suspend disbelief pretty hard to accept the ending. One of the characters exhibits a completely different personality in the last couple chapters than the one we've seen all throughout the rest of the book, and it's done so suddenly that it's almost too much of a stretch."
"I have to admit, I saw a trailer for the movie based on this book coming out soon, and I thought, ""That looks really good!"" I bought the book to read before seeing the movie. It was a good buy. It kept me entertained for the two hours or so that I read each night before I go to bed.The first person narrator is totally unreliable, which can frustrate some people, but I find fun. In that respect, it reminded me a lot of the book Gone Girl, only in this case, the missing woman is not the main female character, although we do get to see things from more than one character's perspective.I found myself wanting to find out what was going to happen next, as the narrator doesn't remember the events of a very important evening. This seems to be a plot device that works well. I just read E. Lockhart's We Were Liars, and her narrator had amnesia about a specific summer.Anyhow, The narrator is a wreck--a drunk who is obsessed with her ex-husband and a couple who live in an apartment she can see while on her train ride each day to a job she was fired from (See? She's a wreck!). This woman gets herself into some trouble. I don't want to say too much more about the book for fear of giving too much away, but I will say that this is a whodunnit.It kept me guessing the entire time I was reading. The only thing I didn't like was the ending. It seemed very Hollywood-ish to me, but as far as the twists and surprises go, it fulfilled them. The characterization was the main problem I had with the ending.The characterization in the rest of the book was strong. Paula Hawkins has a clear grasp of character and motivation. Each character who tells his or her story has a distinct and interesting voice.This is a fun, in a dark sort of way, book for people who like mysteries. Give it a chance! Then go see the movie like I'm going to do so you can compare the two!"
"While the novel is entertaining and one of those books you can read in a day, and though it keeps the reader in suspense some of the time, the prose is quite prosaic and the ending overly melodramatic (and in some sense a bit absurd-- as if written for a Hollywood blockbuster). Most of the characters are wholly unbelievable and superficial, and in some sense the gender stereotypes the book promotes has set us all back at least a few decades. Overall, the book was a quick read and it was, admittedly, gripping up until the last couple of chapters-- just as a bestseller produced for mass consumption should be. Beyond that, it cannot be defined as art or true literature, as intellectually pretentious that may sound."
"This is a good book for pure entertainment.  It did keep me interested.  Some interesting mild twists are there.  Overall a fun read, no real graphic violence, or anything else graphic and dark.  Don't look for anything serious or deep here, obviously, just a fairly quick, light read."
"I really enjoyed this book.  I love POV characters, it makes the story so much more interesting.  I actually read the book in one day because I couldn't put it down.  My book club is passing this one around and I am not the only one who like it.  It is a little like the story in  ""Rear Window"" by Alfred Hitchcock with lots of suspense."
"Absolutely riveting.  Could not put it down.Having just returned from Paris where I was ""the woman on the train"" I found the story plausible and quite engaging, as well as entertaining.Lovely, engaging characters coupled with the authors fluid writing made this something I couldn't stop reading until I was finished with the book!!"
"At first I was confused because I didn't see the characters' names which were written in lighter print at the beginning of each chapter. I thought that it was all about the girl on the train and that she had multiple personalities. Once I noticed the names at the start of each chapter, the story made more sense. It was quite suspenseful and kept me guessing about the identity of the murderer until near the end of the book."
"I was actually not going to read this book but watch the movie instead. However, I had two minutes to just read the first couple of pages and got hooked. I just loved how she captured the atmosphere, like I was feeling and seeing everything she described - that I didn't want to loose that by watching the movie first. Hope the movie is as good! Also, great read for anyone who doesn't understand alcoholism, very eye opening."
Very predictable. Tried to like it and hoped I was wrong as I had it figured out by about a quarter of the way through. Extremely disappointed to find that reading all the way to the end netted me nothing except confirmation of my theory. I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read it; astute readers will be able to put two and two together and figure it out like I did prior to the end and will probably be disappointed with it like I was.
"I purchased this book based on a pre-release review I read in a newsletter. It was downloaded to my Kindle on the release day and I started it soon after. The beginning was slow. It didn't hook me at all. I put it down and only came back to it a couple of weeks later when I didn't have anything else to read.I am glad I did, too. This was a good story. It has been compared to ""Gone Girl"", something I disagree with. It is better than ""Gone Girl"". At least ""The Girl On The Train"" didn't leave me feeling cheated and Rachael was a sympathetic (if somewhat messy) narrator.Stick with the book through the first twenty or so pages. You'll be glad you did."
"Think Gone Girl but not as annoying narrative. I couldn't put it down. You have to pay attention to the chapter titles, and the dates, otherwise you'll end up confused me having to flip back to look at the dates and who was speaking. The end seems kind of rushed and left me kind of like, ""Really? That's it?"" But I guess that's how it goes. All in all, good fast read, good story line. I will definitely recommend it to my friends."
"This is a train wreck you can't stop reading. As much as all of the characters were unlikable, the author keeps you going to see how bad it is going to get. Similar to Gone Girl, you know there will be a twist somewhere. I didn't particularly believe the final twist. The author had purposely manipulated the reader to see it coming. It struck me that, if this person was so messed up, one of the other characters should have seen it sooner. Good, fast read, but not really a satisfying read."
"Extremely bland, extremely predictable, nothing but boredom.Since there is so much hype around this book, I spent the entire time wondering when it would actually turn into a halfway decent story. Let me save you the trouble:  it never gets good.  Every character is so incredibly annoying and fragile that you just end up hating all of them.I am totally baffled about how such a garbage fire of a book actually got published."
Good book. Read it in a day. A similar read to Gone Girl so if you like that type of thriller this is the book to read! The chapters are told from first person by character (the three women characters). The only thing I'd would say about it is the date changes on the chapters made it hard to follow at first- mainly because I didn't realize one voice stayed in one date range and the other voices where in another date range. But once you get the hang of it it becomes a good read. Definitely recommend!
"I has to read this book twice to understand why it disturbed me so much. No clues were given until the very end of the book as to who tricked who. I told my friends not to read it because it showed the protagonist as a pathetic, deplorable, useless alcoholic with no redeeming characteristics. At the end I felt like I'd been socked in the stomach. It made me feel sooo deceived. But, I have to see the movie to see how the characters are portrayed."
"This book had a decent mystery component to it but it could have been shortened by half. I admit to be ""character driven"" and most enjoy books where I can either empathize or admire one or more characters. I found Rachel tiresome and so needy it was frustrating. In Girl on the Train it difficult to like or even sympathize with any of the characters so I struggled to get though it. If I hadn't had to read it for my book club I would quit reading it after a few pages."
The alcoholic amnesia of the main character is tedious and her actions even less believable. She is fundamentally unlikeable because her actions seem so unintelligent that no one in her right mind would do these things. I struggled wanting to finish this book but powered through in the end.
"This book starts out in such an intriguing manner.  I was instantly hooked!  Who is this woman?  What is she seeing?  I was speeding through pages faster than the train sped through the London suburbs.And then... The most heavy-handed use of a plot device that I've ever endured.  Ok, ok - I get it! She's an unreliable narrator.  It's as if the author had just taken a writing class based upon the utilization of plot devices. Twice.There was such promise in the novel, but it was sadly squandered by a plot device that was so overbearing that constantly pulled me out of the narrative."
"I did not care for this book at all. It was confusing, the characters jumped in and out of the story until you weren't sure who you were reading about.I just kept hoping this dragged out book was going to get better, but it never did. sorry, a harsh review, but I just didn't care for it."
"I'm not a fan of alternating 1st person narratives, but I have to admit that the technique led to a better understanding of the characters.  The book was an extraordinarily fast read.  I finished it with a 36 hour period because I kept going back to it whenever I stopped for 10 minutes. The main character is well defined and while I tried to find her sympathetic, she truly annoyed me.I want to see the movie to see how they translated some of it to film."
I had to restart this book twice and almost put it down.  You need to get a little over 10 percent in to get past the lulling roll of the train and into the action.  It becomes a search for lost memories and a lesson in the perils of alcohol and/or self-deception. A Marple of red herrings.  It is engrossing once the story starts and I finished the rest in a single day.  I gave it 3 stars because of the slow start - which I admit may be more punishment than rehabilitation - and the fact that it was seemed derivative and more than a bit precious.  Still it was a good genre read and I recommend it to you.
"IT WAS NOT MY CUP OF TEA, I DIDN'T FINISH IT"
"Troubled,, jobless alcoholic Rachel aimlessly rides the train daily, observing as she goes the events in two homes,  one inhabited by her former partner and his new wife, another by a couple she fantasizes about for their perfect life...until a murder occurs, and eventually Rachel's hapless meddling links all the characters. I'm not usually good at predicting the denoument, but I saw the end to this coming long before it actually happened, and the characters were uniformly so unappealing and artlessly drawn that I didn't much care .  This doesn't belong in the pantheon of great thrillers, that's for sure."
"We read this book for my book club this month and while it started out slow for me, by time I got in a ways it picked up until I was racing to read to the end. I liked the book very much. It was suspenseful and I did not have it figured out part way through like I do with many novels. I like that it fooled me. However, I did not care for the writing style of the author. I do not like it skipping from each characters perspective and I do not care for the dates skipping around. Other than my own personal dislike for the writing style, the story itself was riveting. I do recommend it for anyone that likes a good suspense novel."
"I read this book in 3 days. Couldn't put it down! This is a train ride you won't want to disembark from even after you've come to the end of it.Rachel is a bitter alcoholic divorcee who witnesses something important during a blackout.As she begins piecing things together, she realizes the people she used to watch from the train are not as perfect as they seemed..."
"This novel was the perfect example of how depraved we have become as a society.  I didn't see anything uplifting about the characters behavior to recommend it.  This is not the kind of novel I normally buy.  Too much of what happens to people when they wreck their lives through bad behavior.  I prefer period novels or British humor or just nice, decent stories.  What I did like was the way the author switched back and forth between the main characters, telling the story from their perspective.  Ms. Hawkins weaves a good tail, just not the kind of story line I care for."
"I hesitated to read this book, since some previous reviews made me think it was a take off of Gone Girl--which I really liked, but felt I didn't need to read this book..  However since Emily Blunt is starring in the upcoming movie and I love her so will see the movie, I decided I wanted to read the book. It was cold and rainy today, so I started the book this morning and couldn't put it down--finished it all today.Well written and I couldn't figure out the ending until towards the very end."
"At first I hated this book.  It jumped back and forth betwen times and characters, really hard to keep track.  If you don't like this sort of book then this book is not for you.  It took me half way through to start liking it.  It was a real whodunit mystery.  The character of the Girl (on the train) was not especially likable.  Of course I have a problem with alcohholics.  She was weak and annoying.  Not only was she weak but she wanted to go to bed with every man she saw.  They way I am talking you must think why did this reviewer give it a 4.  Well I wanted to give it a 3 plus but you can't do that.  The ending was good though or should I say the last 1/2 of the book."
"The Girl on the Train has been widely compared to Gone Girl, but I wouldn't stop there. This book has a familiar pattern of intrigue and mystery shared by many similar novels. The characters are well-rounded and interesting. The biggest similarity in this novel to Gone Girl is the balance of women who are vulnerable, yet strong. I especially enjoyed the way the story was told from each character's internal dialog. I finished it in a single sitting, drawn in by the complexity of the protagonist, compelled to follow her on her adventure."
"Comparisons to Gone Girl are a bit generous, as this lacks Gillian Finn's knack for character development and twisted psychology.  Instead, it's more of a Lifetime movie thriller. It eventually becomes a page turner (even if experienced mystery readers see the finale coming from quite a way out)...but overall, I found myself thinking of our protagonist as unbearably weak and the portrayal of male characters to be misandrist.  (At their best narcissistic and self-serving - at worst, which was common, controlling and violent.)  Fine for a plane ride or the beach, but don't get mislead by the flattering praise into thinking this novel will stay with you."
"This book is such a page turner I plunged through it in 3 days. The plot grabs me from the beginning. A woman narrating her observations and thoughts sitting on a train. Why is she so obsessed about the people living along the train tracks? Why is she making up stories of them? What is her story? My thoughts of each character evolves through the story. As I uncovered more of their lives, the characters take on additional dimensions. At the same time, the plot leads you through twists and turns, trying to play detective and unlock the puzzle behind all this.I highly recommend this book. It will keep you intrigued and involved."
"Slow moving depressing story, but interesting non the less. Glad they didn't sugar coat the ending."
It was a good book. Slow to start but once it picked up it was great! I did not see that ending coming. It was similar to Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl but had a way better ending. I'm excited for the movie now
"This novel, that has received high praise judging from its inclusion on best seller lists, I found to be thin.  Female characters were nearly indistinguishable , the chapters devoted to one major character at a time was head-shaking...  now, WHAT was the point of this chapter?  Now, wait a minute:  didn't she (wrong she) say ""X"" in another chapter?  I just plain didn't connect with any character.  The conceit was worthy but unfulfilled."
"I've been up until midnight the last two nights finishing this book. Once I got past the halfway point, I couldn't put it down! I loved the character build-up, and the plot kept me guessing and made me feel like anything was possible. In the end, the surprises kept coming until almost the last page. There were about 5 different times throughout the book that I was convinced I'd figured it all out, only to be thrown another curve again and again. Highly recommend this book (unless you enjoy getting to sleep at a decent hour...in that case, save this one for vacation or a weekend). Great read."
"I loved this book! I had been reading heavy, slow novels of late, but the pace and suspense of The Girl on the Train were excellent. Immediately upon starting the book, I realized our narrator wasn't the most reliable, but I liked her despite all her flaws. Paula Hawkins deftly handled switching narrators in a way that was never confusing, and I never had to look back at what I'd read to understand the shifts in time and narrator. I would highly recommend this if you are looking for an immediately engaging read. It is suspenseful, thought provoking and a great escape. I found myself wanting to read pages at work...thankfully I stopped myself each time."
"I had considered Gone Girl to be at the pinnacle of my favorite genre - the psychological thriller. The Girl on the Train sits beside Gillian Flynn's page-turner, in my opinion. I foolishly began reading Paula Hawkins' book before going to sleep and could not stop until I reached the last page. As was true with Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train must be read carefully, and the reader must pay close attention to details, including the dates embedded in each chapter.The story is told by three women. Rachel, whose life has pretty much bottomed out, rides a train to London every day to fool her flatmate into thinking she has a job. She entertains herself by looking into houses along the tracks and becomes almost obsessed with a couple she sees daily. In Rachel's mind, they are the golden couple and the object of her envy. She even gives them names.Anna, whose house is close to that of the golden couple, is the wife of Rachel's ex-husband, Tom. They have a young daughter, Evie. The affair, which ended Rachel's marriage, was devastating to her, but the most hurtful thing was Anna's pregnancy. Rachel had desperately wanted a child, but the only round of IVF that she and Tom could afford failed and the marriage with it.Megan, the golden wife, lives with her husband, Scott, in another house along the railroad tracks. Rachel is so enthralled by the couple that she fabricates stories about what she considers to be their perfect life. This all charges when she sees Megan kissing another man from the train window.Rachel's already turbulent life takes another nosedive when Megan goes missing. Determined to help the police find her, Rachel is brought into contact with her detractors, Anna, Tom and Scott. Because of her alcoholism, she is treated as a pariah by them and as an unreliable witness by the police. Even she distrusts her faulty memory.The story has countless twists and turns, which demand the reader's complete attention. The characters are beautifully developed as the complex people they are. Just when I thought I had a handle on them, I discovered a new nugget, which completely changed them. As is true in all well-written books of this genre, no one is what he or she seems on the surface. The writing flows effortlessly, gradually building to a climax.I highly recommend The Girl on the Train to fans of books like Gone Girl. Just don't make my mistake and start reading at 11:00 pm because you will most likely lose a night's sleep!"
"I chose this book after many recommendations. The ""twist"" at the end is a good idea- but I feel like the author did not execute it in a justifiable manner. Not many like able characters in this book. Don't really feel for anyone. Just glad there was a resolution."
"Just finished. I absolutely couldn't put it down.the Girl on the Train was a wild roller -coaster of a story with one twist and turn after another. I highly recommend it! Can't wait to see the movie. If you loved Gone Girl, you will love 'The Girl on the Train"
"Blah. I hated this book. I know I am alone in this and it is likely because I feel I have been reading a lot of books involving crazy or mentally unstable women and maybe this one just sent me over the edge, but I had a hard time connecting to the main character. I didn't really feel sorry for her or identify with her. Maybe it's me? I felt the same way about Gone Girl and I know I am pretty much alone in that."
"I don't know how anyone could review this book with less than five stars. It was captivating from page one! I love how the author literally transported you into the lives of the characters, slowly revealing information as the journey went along. Great read!"
"Unlike everyone else I have neither read nor seen Gone Girl, though that's what everyone compares it too.  You feel for and are embarrassed by the protagonist, Rachel, for her weaknesses and the cringe-worthy things she does but she learns and so does the reader that people rarely are what they seem."
"It took a really long time to get anywhere with the plot of this book, and honestly you could figure it out about halfway through.  I was told it starts slow, but honestly I felt like it stayed slow until the end, when the author randomly threw a bunch of events together and concluded the book.  It was entertaining at times, but overall just OK."
"This book is so well written! It had me wondering ""who done it"" the whole time! I think the author really understands the anxt a woman gets when she's in love and has been shafted. Also she had a unique perspective of alcoholism. Couldn't wait to get to the end."
"Great read! Keeps you on your toes, entertaining for sure. As I rarely read thriller like literature I don't have much comparison but I'm happy I followed friend's recommendation to give this one a try. I tecommend it further."
"Fantastic! I binge read this on Kindle while listening to the Audible narration. I highly recommend getting both.  If you purchase the Kindle version, Amazon offers the Audible version to read along for under $8. The 3 women who narrate do an incredible job! They really bring the characters to life!  This is a very suspenseful book. It will keep you guessing until the end! Wonderfully written. I highly recommend this beat seller. You will not be disappointed!"
"The audible book is excellently performed.  The story itself gets long due to the obsessive nature of the characters and being locked up in each of their thoughts. It builds suspense well if you stick with the story.  It gave away the climax a little early and the end wasn't as believable as I think it could have been.  The characters should have stayed a little more to form.  Again, the reader on the audible book made the book better!"
"This book required a little time on my part to easily go back and forth between the first person accounts of the story from the 2 main characters. I sometimes had to go back and remind myself of who was speaking at a particular point. I also found the psychological problems of one of the main characters not pursued enough to explain the reasons why she did what she did. Aside from those 2 things, I liked the book very much.  I loved the use of the ""train"" in telling the story. The ending was somewhat of a surprise to me which is good---I don't like to figure it out ahead of time. I would recommend the book for those who like to think versus be entertained."
"Strange, strange story. I tend to agree with other reviewers that it is hard to sympathize with a drunk who doesn't seem to want to quit. The story seemed to head to only one conclusion, and lo-and-behold, it gets there. Hard to believe it's a number one (1) best seller."
"I haven't read a book since high school and even then I just used SparkNotes. I picked this book up and couldn't put it down. (What a cliche thing to say... Whatever. Like obviously I put it down to like eat and go to the bathroom and have a life and stuff but you all know what I mean.) Anyway, I suddenly just got really into reading, which is an awesome feeling that I've never experienced before, and I have this fantastic book to thank for that! :)"
"I can see why this book is such a hit. Pamela Hawkins is a very fine writer I will continue to follow. She has a great read on human nature and fills her characters quite surprisingly with endearing and not so endearing human gifts and flaws that weave into the plot development so cleverly, you hardly know which way the it will turn. I found it very hard to put down and read into the wee hours. She speaks in many voices, including the victim's voice which is a storytelling technique that works for me almost every time. Hawkins is a real master at pushing and pulling the reader forward and backward in time. I liked how it turned out. Enjoy!"
"Overall I enjoyed this book and read it in two days during the Jonas Blizzard.  It started slowly, but once it got going, it made for a good mystery and suspense story.  I would recommend this book for anyone who enjoys mystery novels, though this book is different in that the heroine is a mess and not entirely relatable (low self-esteem, alcoholic, unemployed)."
"If you would like to read a story about vapid characters who are self absorbed and justify all their actions where even the ""hero"" is so unlikeable go ahead and buy this book. I was interested when ads for the movie were released and as I read it I kept hoping for something redeeming to be revealed and it never came. I read one review that said ""you don't have to like the character to care about that character"". Um... yes you do!"
I had to stop reading this. I couldn't get into it. It was too repetitive and I didn't care for the characters.
"I started reading this book a few times and for some reason I just was not connecting.  I knew some day I would get back to it for I feel I have an obligation to finish a book once it is started.  Anyway the time was right and I finished the book and I am definitely glad I did. I struggled so with Rachel and her low self-esteem. I had such empathy for the young Megan and her loss and cheered Anna at the end for her bravery. I hope to read more from this author, Paula Hawkins."
If you've read Gone Girl then you're going to be really disappointed with this book.  Even more disappointing when you can't put the book down only to find the end was entirely too predictable.  Predictability equals no suspense so it ends up being a total waste of time.
Not my favorite read.  Found it boring and redundant; the last 2 chapters finally added some suspense.
"I enjoyed reading this book and I was surprised by the ending. That being said, when the author doesn't develop the antagonist, the twist is expected. All the females were interesting but I wish the author had developed the men's characters in the same way."
"This murder mystery held my attention and interest more than many similar novels.  It reminded me a good deal of ""Gone Girl,"" so if you liked that, you'll probably like this.  It is narrated in the first person by three separate women.  My only complaint was that all three female characters seemed in many ways similar to each other - probably the author's intent, but it it just kind of bothered me that they all seemed more or less like the same person.  It's still a good read."
They made this a movie????  I can't believe this is number 1 best seller. The characters are unlikable and uninteresting.  The jumping from character to character and time lines was annoying. I felt I needed a spreadsheet to keep tract. One of the worst books I've ever read.
Amazing book. As usual much better than the movie.. Lol..  Everyone always says that but that's because the book can have more in it. The movies need to fit the man story points into an allotted time period. I read on my kindle paper white some nights until I couldn't hold my eyes open. Definitely recommend even if you have already seen the movie. So much was not in it... And the book is set in London. Hope you enjoy it! <f0><U+009F><U+00A4><U+0093><f0><U+009F><U+0093><U+0096><f0><U+009F><U+0093><U+009A>
"This was a really good read. The storyline kept my attention and the plot was great. I was anticipating a bit more of a thriller/suspense novel out of this, but I will say that the end was at least a little unexpected. Otherwise this was a good read that I truly enjoyed."
"What's the fuss?  I was looking forward to reading before the movie came out.  I read it and it was the same thing over and over again.  No plot twists, just blackouts and alcoholism wrapped up in murder.  Nothing special.  No interest in seeing the movie.  This book was not a page turner nor was it something I looked forward to reading.  I kept reading waiting for something, but by the end, I was glad it was over."
"I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT, AT FIRST, I STARTED GETTING A LITTLE ANTSY.  I DON'T DRINK, AND TO HEAR OF SOMEONE ELSE THAT DOES JIUST GETS ME IMPATIENT.  HOWEVER, IT WASN'T FOR LONG, AND I SUDDENLY FOUND THAT I WAS CAUGHT UP IN THE SUSPENSE AND TRYING TO GUESS WHO DID IT.  I REALLY ENJOYED IT."
I read this book for my book club.  This was a decent book but I didn't see what all the fuss about it was.  I was not drawn into the mystery as much as I should have been.  The main character has few likable characteristics and the supporting characters had no depth.  I found myself questioning all of the main premises of the book.  Nothing was developed enough for me to really care about what happened.  I think this could make a much better movie - perhaps that was the idea all along.
I struggled thru Rachel's drunkenness. I wanted to leave the book but forced myself to finish. It is depressing  and the ending left me with a hopeless feeling.
"For those that compare this with Gone Girl, this book is not as good.  I don't know why but current fiction seem to frequently depict females as needy, whiney, neurotic and males as selfish and violent.  Sure, there are people like that and that is probably what makes some books thrilling, but I just didn't care for the character portrayals in this book.  The first part of the book I was pretty disgusted with all the characters.  It only got a bit better towards the middle and end of the book.  If I really like a book I will read it more than once, this book, I would probably not a book I would read again."
"Great story. I appreciate books where the characters are not all beautiful and simple - this one is filled with ordinary people. The protagonist in this book is basically a good person albeit flawed. The story is quite dark as the character takes the reader along on her attempt to solve a confusing mystery. Her personality is so well developed that I found myself really caring about what happened to her. I gave the book to my wife, who then recommended it to my daughter. We all loved it and look forward to seeing the movie."
"This book is told by three women connected by lies and infidelity.  Rachel's voice is particularly tedious since she's either drunk, hungover, sick, or in need of another drink.  She is the book's unreliable narrator...the reader can't trust her stuporous narrative and she can't trust her own words either.  None of the women is someone you'd want to hang out with and they all have a toxic point of view.  But I stuck with the tale and was moderately surprised to learn who the murderer was, but at that point, I didn't care much.  It could make a more interesting movie, but the continuous internal monologues would have to be omitted which might be a good thing"
"The story might have been interesting if I felt like any of the characters were likable or even described well. Very few of the characters, though speaking in first person, were realistically written. There was no real background to any of them; it was written like a fake, cheap romance novel, if you ask me. It felt as if everyone were distant in the story. By the end, I just wanted to get through it so I could say I finished and would be able to talk about it with my book club. I left feeling like I didn't care if anyone lived or died, not because I'm an uncompassionate person, but because the characters felt so unreal. Not good."
"I bought this book on Monday and finished it on Thursday...it was that thrilling. I didn't love this book, though, and now I feel like I need to read something light and fluffy. It's very dark with little warmth or humor to balance the sinister. Everyone who's compared this book to a Gillian Flynn book is right...the books have that same dark feeling. The story itself is all right, but at the end I badly wanted to know a little more about what happened to the characters.This would be a good book to take to the beach-it's an easy read. I bought the Audible version at a reduced price and the narrators are great."
"This book was fantastic, I loved and hated all of the characters and was so anxious at the end of each section to find out what happened next that if I'd had the time I probably could have read the whole thing in one sitting. The tone was very dark and the twist wasn't particularly shocking but was delivered in a way that made you realize the clues were there the whole time. One of the rare books that I want to read again right away and I can't wait to see the upcoming movie adaptation!"
"Though 2 stars is a low rating this book isn't terrible by any means, it's just nothing exceptional. The writing was good, I can't fault Paula Hawkins on that. The problem is the disdainful characters. My contempt for them stems not from their acts but rather their lack of any redeeming, interesting, qualities. I can be enthralled by characters like Dorian Grey or Frank Underwood regardless of their unsightly actions because their personalities stand out. In The Girl on the Train each character is only a collection of actions and plot related concerns that changes like ""clouds scudding across the sky, now dark, now light."""
"This book literally takes the reader for a ride, a journey, into the minds and thoughts of the three women at its core.  Along the way we see things that are sad, things that we possibly understand, and maybe even some things we wish we did not understand.  This is the story of journeys after all.  Some physical, some mental, some emotional.  And it is a story of how seeing things as they are is not as easy as seeing them the way we want them to be.  Oh.  And the mystery.  It grabs you from the first page.  A good read."
"Of the three female characters, all were week--either drunks, immoral and/or receiving their self esteem from men.  It made me feel embarassed to be a woman after reading it.  I couldn't believe it was written by a woman that would make other women look so poorly in a popular book.  I would not recommend this book to anyone"
"I enjoyed this, and would probably give it more of a 3.5 star rating. While not perfect and not a favorite, it definitely kept me interested throughout, which is a crucial thing for me. I at least kept wanting to turn the page.However, I didn't find it that ""thrilling,"" which is unfortunate, because it is a thriller after all, and when I read from that genre, I expect the usual feeling of reading with bated breath. I didn't experience that with The Girl On The Train.Don't get me wrong, I thought it was intriguing and entertaining enough, and I do recommend this for others to try out for themselves, but for me, it just didn't blow my mind."
"The characters start to develop slowly but deliberately; and the reason, which looking back now is to not give too much of the main story plot away, as well as, to not show who is most innocent and whom the worst and most flawed of all of the characters really is. Although, they are all ""morally"" flawed characters the ""real sociopath"" at the end reveals himself/herself to the reader and the others in an ""ahha monent!"" Good read overall, not as crisp and sharply written as Gone Girl but It is perhaps that it takes place in England. I figured out who done it by mid book but the end surprised me."
"I had high hopes for this book. I wanted to like it. The plot was right up my alley. What a let-down. None of the characters were likeable, except Evie, and I'm not sure if she even counts-- she was more of a prop. The writing was decent, which saves it from a one-star rating. If you want a book that focuses on three women, read Liane Moriarty's _Big Little Lies_."
This was a pain in the ass book to read.  I am glad that it is finished.  I can see why to movie only got 1.5 stars.
I really enjoyed the book! I decided to buy it to read on the plane on my way to Asia. I liked it! I almost left it behind because it was weighing my backpack down (LOL)! I actually enjoyed the story narration and it had a huge twist to it! It's not s***ty like Twilight and 50 shades (even though I read and loved all those books). It was eerie and kept me wondering what in the HECK is going on.I read online that there might be a movie in the works! We shall see if and how it will turn out! I like to read books before the movies come out to see the difference. I don't believe it will disappoint!
This book was very well written. I really liked Paula Hawkin's style. The way she used a calendar date to tell each character's story of what took place on that date and how the suspense is tied into the story to the point of making me read faster to find out what's going to happen next. The surprises of what I thought was going to happen that didn't happen was thrilling. I recommend this book because it was a great story of how we go along with our daily routines but we all experience something different in our travels of wondering about the scenery we take in either by car bus or train.
"I wanted so much to like the characters,  but found myself scoffing through much of this book.  They are all self absorbed, pathetic and just plain boring. I could not like, nor feel sorry for any of them.  Rachel drove me crazy with the mess she continued to make of her life.  Anna was a sorry excuse for a wife and mother.  Each and every character was dis-likable in their own way and I got tired of the phony dramas in their lives.  I could not wait to get this book over with and the only reason I stuck with it was to prove that I figured out ""who did it"" by mid book.  I was right by the way.  Why on earth the high ratings - I will never know."
"I cannot believe that anyone enjoyed reading this book.  I hated it and had to force myself to finish reading it.  It's the first time I hated every character in a book.  The grammar was atrocious, also.  Why did she not have a professional edit the book?  I don't know how many times she wrote something along the lines of ""...neither of them ARE ... ""  SCREECH!!!  Terrible, terrible, poorly written book."
"The first few chapters were so depressing I couldn't read anymore, so my review is not based on the entire book.  If you have been through a heartwrenching break up and are not quite healed, do yourself a favor and find something else to read.  I'm not sure why anyone would want to immerse themselves that deeply in someone else's misery.  I'm sure there are people who will enjoy this book...maybe people that don't know that pain as well, or maybe people who have completely healed.  My friends loved it.  Absolutely not for me."
"Quite disappointed in this book, all the hype is not justified. The author writes well but I thought the plot a comparatively poor imitation of Gone Girl, doesn't have anything like the depth of that book. Rachel's story got so tedious, with her endlessly getting drunk and blacking out. The whole thing had little substance for me, with one dimensional and very unsympathetic characters. Seemed to me like the author admired Gone Girl and then wrote something fairly similar to get a quick best-seller. Seems to have worked for her. I just hope her next book has more originality and depth."
I liked the framing of the story in the beginning but by the middle toward the end it's to married to a format that doesn't make since anymore.The finale seems too big of a shift for the antagonist. I was hoping for a better twist but this is my first murder mystery novel. Not sure if this is typical.I wanted to read this before seeing the movie so I have a better base to judge the movie.
"Very good page-turner, and Hawkins has boldly put an unhappy and often reprehensible drunk as her central figure. Much of the action revolves around Rachel's drunkenness, self-loathing and sad pining over her ex-husband, now happily remarried after an affair and with a new baby. Told very much from a woman's viewpoint, Hawkins uses three separate voices for Rachel, Megan - a girl she knows only from seeing from the train into  London - and Anna, the new wife of her ex, Tom.In some ways, the novel is as much a psychological thriller as it is a murder mystery. Rachel is an anti-hero with rafts of problems, a lamentable lifestyle and an unrequited need - almost at a primal scream level - for a child. The characters are generally well-drawn, though the milieu is very circumscribed and, for Rachel, almost suffocating.The ending (or at least the culprit) is pretty well telegraphed toward the end and comes after Rachel tries repeatedly to recall her actions during a drunken blackout - though how she finally does it isn't truly believable. The Girl on the Train seems almost as though it could be autobiographical, and that's a tribute to Hawkins. She really gets the reader into Rachel's skin, for better or (often) for worse, and the seedy near suburbs of London make a good setting for a woman on the verge of a breakdown."
Great book that kept me guessing! Each time I thought I knew what happened to the missing girl they threw something in to change my mind! Near the end I figured it out but still a great time reading this. Was often hard to put down!
I really enjoyed the book. I also liked how it was done in a diary dorm through the three main women of the book. Really enjoyed reading it and was not thrown by who done it all at the end of the book. Cant wait to see how the movie goes off this
I started to read the book and thought this is slow to start. As you get to know reach character you feel their emotion. It pulls you in chapter by chapter till you discover who is the killer. Excellent read
I really expected more from this book with all of the hype behind it. I spent 3 days reading it and struggled to concentrate on what I was reading. Hopefully for once the movie is better than the book.
"I've decided this is just not my genre. I read it and was captivated the first half but it was,well...predictable in that you knew another twist or turn would happen in the plot. Not great, not horrible. Perhaps you'll enjoy it more than me."
"I chose 5 stars because I felt the pain, animosity and dejection in all three women. In the past 2 weeks I've been dealing and trying to cope with a break up due to my own accord, come to find out that he was fine with my decision and wants nothing to do with me. which caused a whole new tide of unwanted emotions to arise, leaving me very much confused and devastated. While reading between these three correlating stories,i felt that I knew what they were going through, not only with my experience with this current break up, but my prior relationships that have gone wrong. It hit to close to home emotionally that I felt it deserved my time, comment, and 5 stars.Now base the book completely on material and not an emotional stand point. I'd give it a 4. I still enjoyed the book immensely, but going back and forth, time lines between each transaction was a little hard for me. Not because I couldn't keep up, but because there wasn't enough character development between each other. I would of liked to know more about Scott and Tom. More about all three woman. Mostly Anna. I felt we got into it pretty deep with Megan and Rachel, lack of characters was a tiny bust in my shoes, but hey! How many books have I taken to the bank.. ASide from that I loved the book. Well done."
"I will admit to reading this book because of all the reviews and the movie coming out. It was a very twisty story, but there was not one redeeming character in this novel, which made it incredibly difficult to enjoy or want to keep reading."
"The idea of the book was original and clever. How many of us imagine stories around people we see with some regularity when we commute? I liked the big reveal that Rachel lived 4 houses away in her recent past and that introduced some interesting possibilities. Past that, I found the book difficult to read and ultimately poorly constructed. All voices in first person can work as a style of writing when each character has a distinct voice so that the reader can differentiate between characters. In this book, only the chapter headings helped. In fact, I wondered 40 pages in or so if this was one person with multiple personalities or if Megan and Anna were figments of her imagination, much like fictionalized Jess and Jason. Hard to empathize with any of these characters. The women are all alike (dependent, self-absorbed) and the men are manipulative with violent streaks. Where are characters with more complexity and balance, with a sense of self? This just failed on so many levels for me. It wasn't informing, entertaining or thought-provoking so I could never recommend it."
"Overall I enjoyed this book and read it in two days during the Jonas Blizzard.  It started slowly, but once it got going, it made for a good mystery and suspense story.  I would recommend this book for anyone who enjoys mystery novels, though this book is different in that the heroine is a mess and not entirely relatable (low self-esteem, alcoholic, unemployed)."
"This book is like a Gone Girl lite. Lots of twists and turns in the plot. Rachel is an alcoholic, divorced, and unemployed. She rides the train everyday to fool her flat mate that she is still working. She passes by her old home where her ex-husband lives with his new wife and baby. A few doors down, there is a couple. Rachel gives them names and makes up vignettes about their lives. Then the wife disappears and Rachel is involved but she doesn't remember how. I think the biggest problem is that, at least for me, I didn't particularly like Rachel, she is a bit of a mess. However, by the end I sympathize with her."
"Excellent story telling. Pay attention to the dates, as the story does skip around a bit in time, but the narrative holds your attention and you wonder about what is actually happening versus what the protagonist sees. I liked the way it evolves into a mystery, and the latter part of the novel is fascinating how the author leads you into the reality of events from the inquisitive mind of our lead protagonist.."
This book was good.  Not great. Hard to follow the dates and voices at times.  I wanted to read it before I saw the movie.
"Loved this book - couldn't put it down. It's not five-star the way a Henry James novel is, but it is five-star for its genre - a just-perfect mystery that leaves you guessing until the end. It was a perfect book to fill the Christmas-to-New Year's lull. What's more, I no longer look at people I know the same way - I keep wondering what's behind their facades! Having worried that the book was going to be just another Gone Girl, I can happily say it was better than that book - more believable, less preposterous. A great, fun read."
"My book club read this book and I have to say that none of us really loved it.  We compared it a bit to Gone Girl, as it was so dark.  The biggest problem for us is that we didn't like any of the characters and so we really didn't care what happened to them.  I...and indeed we (book group)...felt the book was overrated. It has been on the Best Seller list for ages, so perhaps I expected too much.  I wasn't particularly impressed with the writing either.  It just wasn't my cup of tea, I guess.  It held my attention but I had the ending figured out in advance..  It was ok."
"This may be the buzz book of the year but if you are looking for Gone Girl you will be disappointed. The characters are not well developed and by the end when all is revealed, I just didn't care that much. I don't mind unreliable narrators, it can make a novel all the more interesting, but I do not enjoy spending time with drunks which is how the main narrator, Rachel, is described. I don't think that she ever becomes sympathetic which is fine but you have to care about some character in the novel to keep reading and I don't know that any of them fills that bill. If I hadn't been reading this on a plane, I would have given up on it."
This was a clever story as well as a well written one. The characters are very different as you read each characters thoughts. The story is told by three women basically. The author makes each one of them a very different character and she does it excellently. It does take a few chapters together to get it straight but it grabbed me and raced me along with the commuter train. The only thing I did not enjoy was the lack of real love and caring portrayed by the married couples. I must say that my blood pressure spiked each time I read it. Whew! for an exciting read I give it five stars.
"I was late coming to this book and had heard so much about it!  Luckily, I had seen no spoilers.  I enjoyed the book as the writing is good.  I like the various perspectives of the characters involved.  I found I was invested in more of the characters than one, and I was always anxious to get to the next turning point.  I had theory after theory as I was reading and that's my reason for reading this type of book......to challenge myself as I am being entertained.  All in all a great read!"
I just wish Rachel had a happier ending!!! I really enjoyed this story!!! And I loved that I read the book before I saw the movie!!! A lot more information than the movie!!! I enjoyed the book; you really got to see what the characters were really like!! At first I didn't like Rachel and then when I continued to read I felt sorry for her and was egging her on to do the right thing and get her life together!!!
"The time-shifting and narrator changes were confusing at the beginning, but became easier to handle after the first few times.  By changing the narrators, particularly Rachel who may or may not reliable, the book creates tension and mystery.  About three quarters of the way in, I had a suspicion how it was going to resolve, but the execution was still interesting, as the motivations of the third (?) narrator are more difficult to discern."
"Definitely not a fan of this book, it was slow, couldn't like or relate to any of the characters. The story in and of itself was not suspenseful at all. Got a little over 1/2 way through the book - that's as far as I can take it."
"""The Girl on the Train"" is an excellent read! I love it when I don't see the twists coming, and this novel is full consists of twists and a totally unexpected ending! If you're a fan of ""Gone Girl"" you will love this novel!"
"What a great read! I couldn't put it down, didn't want to! So many twists and turns with quite a surprise ending! A wonderful murder mystery!!!"
"This novel as an audiobook was quite enjoyable, but I'll have to chalk that up to the three fantastic female narrators, for the pace of the story and the structure of the chapters becomes somewhat tedious. When I would switch to reading this through Kindle, I somewhat lost my interest. I felt that the story was a little too basic for my liking, but I did like the ""Hitchcockian"" undertones. In the end the plot became somewhat predictable, but it will keep you engaged enough to read through to the end. I thought that the length of this novel was perfect to tell this story."
"When you hear the term psychological thriller, it fits into a certain genre. The Girl on the Train pretty much is all about psychology. Told in the first person in the perspective of three women whose lives are inextricably intertwined through the men in their lives. The essence of the story is about emotional and psychological manipulation and the resultant self perception left at the end of it. I found the novel captivating and the whodunit side of it absorbing. There are questions asked throughout. Whose side is who on? Read it and find out, you won't be disappointed."
So many twists and turns it's hard to keep them straight. None of the characters in this book are particularly likeable or sympathetic but I could not put it down.
I read this for a book club and it was good. It wasn't great because the beginning was slow moving and I had a few moments where I thought I wouldn't make it. But it picked up midway and I thoroughly enjoyed the book after that! I guessed some things right and a few took me by surprise! Which is good for me because I usually figure things out. I would recommend this book. Going to see the movie this week with my book club girls!
This book is ok.  I believe there was a lot more hype to it then need be.  I felt like I knew ALL about the characters drinking problem and when the build up finally came at the end it was the last 90% of the book.  So the other 80% wasn't worth it..  I read a lot of books and I felt this one wasn't on  a top 10 list for me.  It didn't hold my interest and I actually wanted to stop reading it after a while..
"This book was recommended to me, so that was a great beginning. I liked the premise of this book. I liked the repetitiveness of her train ride with the little differences and nuances of each day. I wouldn't call this book a thriller, but a good mystery.  The conclusion was fairly easy to guess, but I liked it that it didn't hit you from left field. It made sense, and I liked that. I enjoyed this book. I wouldn't HIGHLY recommend it. It is an easy, fast read. That is why I rated it 4 stars. It is nice to sometimes have a breather from heavier, deeper books. I will want to try another book by this author, Paula Hawkins."
"I read the whole book in 2 sittings so guess it intrigued me but I didn't like any of the characters. I guessed the end half way through, however years of watching Kojak as a kid have made me a semi professional at guessing who ""done it""!"
"I read this book in a couple of days and enjoyed it.  I thought it was well written and I liked how each chapter was from a different character's point of view.  None of the characters were that likable, but then, who is?  :)But seriously, the main character was weak and did some pretty foolish things.  However, this made her interesting and you never knew what she was going to do next.  I do wish that she'd ended up being stronger after all she'd gone through, but she was still running away from things and afraid in the end.  I'd recommend this book as a fun, suspenseful and easy read."
"I have to say that it was a wonderful book. I was kept on the edge of my seat the whole time. I didn't try to think ahead I just went with the flow as I believe the author wished for me. People in reviews said the were confused but that shouldn't have been necessary. After a few pages you get them etched in your mind so vividly. I am 70 so my memory really isn't that good, so at first I wrote the characters names down and a bit of a description of them. I referred to it after I was forced to put my book down and do some dang work. I would quickly review my notes and just like that I was back into my story. ( I. Loved. Every. Moment. Of. This. Book.)  Any resemblance to Gone Girl is silly. That book had a stupid ending.  I don't have a single complaint about the story. I do have a complaint about the people here telling too many details about the story. I stayed away on purpose because I knew they would ruin the story for me.Paula, you wrote a fabulous story and it was way more satisfying than Gone Girl could have hoped to have been. I will miss the thrill of having this book to read.................what am I going to do with myself. Any book I pick up will pale in comparison!!"
"This was a good read but like others, I was disappointed with the ending. I feel like the writer ran out of her story line and decided to just rush through the ending.It certainly was not worth the $11 I paid for it."
"The tension & mystery builds as the story unfolds. Told through the eyes of 3 disparate women bound by a thin thread, each of them emerges as someone you could know & sympathize with. The 3 male characters offer an excellent foil. Page turner."
"While I admittedly have a low bar on much crime/suspense fiction, this may be the most overhyped fiction of my recent experience. There was not an interesting character among the self pitying, self destructive cast of this book who, when faced with a set of choices, always made the wrong one. I was often tempted to toss this book aside mid-stream but did not, somehow hoping there was something I was missing. Alas, there was not."
"I enjoyed this book and found it to be a very fast read. I liked the writing style, which was to the point and not filled with unnecessary detail. The more I read, the more I wanted to continue reading until the end. I give this book only 4 stars because I was expecting more of a shocking twist at the end, given all the hype about this book. I had the ending figured out long before it was revealed. Even with my disappointment at the ending, I would still highly recommend this book."
"I was skeptical going into this book. But it sucked me in and was a great read throughout. Great pacing, smartly written, amazing settings. First book in a while I couldn't put down. Really well written mystery."
"I found myself reading this every chance I got.  The style was different and absorbing.  It's been a while since I read a mystery and this was well written and suspenseful.  Read it, it won't take long at all!"
"Decided to get on board with this one and see what all the hype was about. Not the most well-written book, a little confusing and hard to follow at some times. The jumping around of dates was a little difficult to grasp at times as well.But a great plot-line, constantly moving and changing and keeping me engaged, at times I could barely put it down! And although I picked up on the killer a few chapters before it was revealed, certainly not what was expected at the start."
"This book started off very slowly and the main character is quite annoying because I find all alcoholics annoying at the very least.  I read a review somewhere that complained about the inability to tell who was narrating which chapter so I made sure to pay attention to that.  The pace of the novel was very, very slow, particularly to start with and mostly I wanted to slap the main character.  It got better and I did develop some sympathy for her but the one thing that never did get cleared up was about the ability to remember things that happen, and I can't say anything more without a spoiler and I won't do that.  I don't object to having read this book.  I think it could have been better paced, and it would have been good to have some characters who were so - awful is too strong a word but it's all I've got at the moment.  I must give the author credit for one red herring that I totally fell for,and I must give her credit for having led me quite astray about what happened to the main character, but that's not enough to overcome my dislike of the characters and the very slow pace."
"It’s hard to be objective about a novel that strives so determinedly (and successfully) to make its characters as unlikable as those in Paula Hawkins’ bestselling mystery, “The Girl On the Train”. With not one, but three, unreliable narrators jumping back and forth in time offering first-person perspectives on unfolding events, the book chronicles the intertwined stories of sad-sack drunkard, Rachel, the titular girl on the train; Megan, the secretive blonde half of a seemingly perfect couple Rachel spies on from the train; and Anna, a hard-edged suburbanite who envisions herself as the perfect wife and mother.The central mystery begins when one of the women goes missing.The main narrative, necessarily, comes from Rachel, still wallowing in booze and self-pity years after her husband left her for the younger, prettier Anna. In fact, Anna, the usurper, and Rachel’s ex-husband are still living in the same house that once belonged to Rachel. Having lost her job due to drunkenness, Rachel still takes the train each day from the suburbs into London, not only to make her sober-minded roommate think she’s still gainfully employed, but also to keep an eye on her ex and the woman occupying her old home; the train just happens to pass right by the place. A few doors down lives a beautiful young couple whom Rachel also watches, becoming a little too fascinated by their lives lived largely out in the back yard and through open windows. Although Rachel nicknames them Jess and Jason and envies what she perceives to be their idyllic wedded bliss, it soon becomes apparent that appearances are deceiving, especially after she witnesses a shocking act that shakes up her vicarious fantasy life. But, did she, in fact, see what she thought she saw? Rachel’s reality is blurred from heavy drinking which often results in blackouts; her problems are compounded by her stalking of not only her ex-husband, Tom, and his increasingly agitated wife, but of Scott and Megan, the real-life “lovebirds” Rachel knows as Jess and Jason. What follows is a harrowing, sometimes confusing yarn that allows for no “good guys” and sees Rachel making one misstep after another after another until finally, I lost patience with her to the point that I found it difficult to finish the book. A main character doesn’t necessarily have to be likable, or even relatable, to maintain a good story but they should offer up something—sympathy, grudging admiration, even hatred—to keep the reader hooked in to that character, to want to know what happens to him or her. Rachel used up what sympathy I had for her very quickly, and while I didn’t like her at all, I didn’t dislike her enough by the end to care what happened to her. By the time she finally rallies from her downtrodden hangdog state, it was too little, too late; I simply didn’t care. However, being very familiar with the behavior of alcoholics, I did find Rachel’s behavior to be believable (for the most part), if tiring.The character of Megan was more interesting, and perhaps, more sympathetic. With dark secrets in both her past and present, Megan is a well-structured character who is damaged and self-destructive, not a nice woman but not someone who is intentionally cruel. Her own missteps, more dramatic than Rachel’s (at least early on), are poignant and truly heartbreaking, and while the character of Rachel is the protagonist of the story, it is Megan who really drives it.Anna, the third voice in “Girl On the Train”, is probably the least developed of the three narrators. Presented as a vain, calculating homewrecker whose deeds are doubling back on her, Anna is something of a narcissist, who is, understandably, at the end of her rope with Rachel and her attendant drama. Anna considers herself to be clear-headed and sane compared to the other female characters in the novel, although her narcissism precludes her from seeing that she’s as deluded as they are.The problem I found with having three narrators is that their voices begin to seem strangely similar as one chapter featuring Anna flows into the next chapter, narrated by Rachel, and so on. If Rachel isn’t on a drunken binge, it’s difficult to separate her musings from those of Anna; in more than one instance, I found myself thumbing back to the beginning of a chapter to see if it was titled “Rachel”, “Anna” or “Megan”.The men in the story are also difficult to separate in some instances, and even more sketchily written than Anna. Tom, Anna’s husband and Rachel’s ex, is very much like Scott, Megan’s husband, and neither seems to be all that distinctive. There’s also a shady psychiatrist on hand who doesn’t seem to balk at bedding his patients, and a couple of cops who never come to life, existing merely as words on a page. Of course, they’re an awkward necessity in moving the story forward (and in offending Rachel).Also awkward is the fact that characters narrate events in the present, often simultaneously with a different character in the following chapter, while another character narrates events from months, or years, earlier. Again, it’s a necessity in moving the story forward (and in tying up all the loose ends) but it feels awkward. The solution to the mystery, when it comes, isn’t surprising but it is serviceable and doesn’t insult the reader’s intelligence.As trying as I often felt “The Girl On the Train” to be, it does offer up some suspense, and isn’t altogether horrible. Paula Hawkins writes well and I hope she’ll up her game on her next literary outing."
This was well written but I was often bored by the main character's constant drinking. It just got old.  None of the characters were especially likable. This o e may actually be a better movie than book.
"Maybe it's because I've read so many books of this type, but I found the story to be predictable, and the ending was not a surprise for me.Additionally, I did not find the characters to be all that likable.  Rachael comes across as a sloth.  Megan reads as a self-centered, conniving, bish, although she has a revelation of such profound and utter sadness that my heart sank to the pit of my stomach for several hours (getting into a book brings the characters alive for me; they are temporarily people that 'I know').  Anna both revels in gloating satisfaction and plays the weak victim at the same time.  Cathy is a roommate with a level of patience that doesn't seem believable.  Tom and Scott, even when they aren't doing anything 'wrong', both seem like condescending jerks to me.I feel like I am 'supposed' to like this book, because someone liked it well enough to turn it into a major motion picture, but I can't quite give it a glowing review.I will say that the author did a decent job of keeping the twists and turns easy enough to follow.  The story was 'okay'.  I'm glad I read it, but it didn't stand out as a read above the rest."
"At the beginning, I was a little confused by the narrative switching between characters.  Once I became used to the format, I was riveted by this story and couldn't wait to see what the next chapter or train ride would bring.  If you haven't read this book yet, pay attention to dates as well as which character is telling the story so you can see the big picture of this drama playing out.  I loved how my feelings toward the characters kept changing as the author revealed more about them. I would give this one a big thumbs up!"
"I can describe 90% of the book with one word:boringso.boring.Nothing happened for literally about 90% of the story.Then, once we got into it a little (maybe around 30%), I started feeling another emotion: hatred. I literally hated (or at least didn't like) every single character.Sure, I understood why some of the characters (mainly the MC) were such a mess. For a while I sympathized, but honestly my patience wore thin. They were all either absolutely nuts and kept making the same mistakes over and over, or they were just annoying.Even when everything came together at the end and got a bit more exciting, I still wasn't nearly as excited as I should have been, largely because I didn't care about ANYONE. I had no one to root for since I kind of hated them all. This made me pretty indifferent about solving the mystery all together.I really wanted to like this book, but it was just too slow/boring for too long, and I wanted at least one character to fall in love with and be able to stand behind.. but I literally couldn't root for any of them. :("
I wish there were more books like this. Although it was somewhat difficult to Renner which year u were in if u didn't read straight through but I love the time hop and the writing will just entrap you. Definitely recommend this easy fast paced read
"I wanted to read this book to see what all the hype was about, but this one really missed the mark with me. Nothing noteworthy happens until half way through the book. There are no likable characters to root for either. I kept waiting to see if ""the girl on the train"" was going to do something interesting or just be a miserable drunk. Yes, the real villain is an unlikely character, but finding that out on the last 5% of the book didn't redeem it for me. I am really surprised this book is so popular."
"I wasn't impressed. Had I known the main character was a ragging alcolic,  I wouldn't have wasted my money.  ""Woes me"" doesn't cut it for me. So many other great mystery / thriller authors out there."
"I'm sorry but I actually wish that this author had never written this story. It was crazy, you can't keep up with every twist and turn. I honestly hope that this author never writes another story."
Meh. Edge of seat but so meh. Typical characterizations. I wanted to know 'who dun it' but I really didn't care about any of the characters and therefore wasn't invested. It was definitely a movie-type-book.
Enjoyed reading this book.  Lots of interesting characters and unexpected turns.  I can't wait for the movie to come out and see how it plays out on screen.
"I’d initially been on the fence about buying and reading The Girl on the Train, not because I was put off by the content but because it reminded me of so many other bestsellers I’d already read. But I gotta tell you that I’m a sucker for taking a walk on the dark side, so I eventually caved and made the purchase.Despite the formula, the storytelling and style is unique so I’d still suggest you give this a go if you’re into a psychological thriller that digs very, very deep. It’s not a book for the faint-hearted or those looking for happily ever afters, but it’s a solid one if you enjoy reading about humanity’s more sinister side."
"I didn't like this book on several levels.  None of the three main female characters were in the least likeable--all unemployed self absorbed whiners; by mid-book I was hoping they would all be victims of a serial killer.  After the murderer is revealed, it's (I won't say he or she) character is somewhat hamhandedly portrayed.  I finished it by skimming through a lot of the tedious dialogue.  Can't believe there's talk of making it into a movie.  I did like the premise of the voyeuristic train ride, but that's about it."
It's a very intense read with many twists and turns.  The conclusion is not foreseable.
"This is not a bad story, but it doesn't bring anything new. The writer juggles suspicion between characters(Possible spoiler)then reveals the murderer to be the least suspected character.(Spoiler)Also the ending was a let down, where the ""villain"" does the typical i will explain everything now, and the ""heroine"" who is portrayed as a weak depressed alcoholic,  suddenly has the power to stab a person and do some kung-fu moves on the villain.(End of spoiler)As I said this is not a bad story, but you probably have read this or seen this numerous times before."
"At first, the detailed first-person writing style sucked me in. But then it wasn't picking up speed, just felt depressing reading how out of control Rachel's addictions were, but then I tried some more and it finally gained traction and before I knew it, I couldn't put it down. By the end, I was hiding from my family so I could finish it without interruption :). I haven't read a book this engrossing....and so incredibly spot-on with personality motivations and actions...in quite a while. Highly recommend it...to those who are struggling, those who are causing others to struggle, and those who need to recognize the dangers of both."
"A page turner!  From different character perspectives, the story (with an unsolved murder) evolves in a refreshingly unique way. It is a character study novel where the reader gradually and intimately gets to know each personality woven into a web of interpersonal complexity. Putting all the characters' narratives together and analyzing ""the most likely suspect"" was an entertaining reader challenge. Piecing together the ""teasing"" clues of each character's capacity for murder made it hard to put this book down. Which one could murder?  I really enjoyed this book--very suspenseful, a good read!"
"My expectations where not met when reading this book.  I found it slow moving and not very suspenseful.  Sarah s poor me pity me attitude was monotonous and tiring.  However, Hawkins did capture the alcohol attitude and behavior making most of Sarah's actions believable and predictable.  Sarah did have to be commended for her persistence to fill in the blanks of her black out.  Well the mystery/murder got solved."
"I know this is a highly-rated NYT Bestseller - but I personally found it hard to follow for at least the first half of the book.  It jumps back/forth between the ""Girl on the Train"" and the individuals she sees from the train and later interacts with.  She is a troubled person and, for much of the book, this interaction seems like a series of delusions (is she just imagining all this or is she schizophrenic and these other people are just her other personalities??)-- until the plot starts to fill in.  No spoilers here.  Overall, it was OK - but lacked the intensity and story-line clarity that I seek in a novel like this."
"I thought this was a depressing story about a down and out alcoholic who has lots of problems. The obscene language was offensive. The plot was unusual and there were some surprising twists at the end, but I would not recommend this book."
"Confusing ... took me 3 times to get through the beginning because of the way the author makes the name of each chapter a character's name and goes back and forth in time.  For this reason, I had to keep putting it down.  Then time lapsed and I had to start over.  Finally put it down again for a long time and decided just finish it already which I did quickly.  Picked up the last 40 pages so only an OK."
"I am a young adult who is very much just into to reading the average young adult romance. This book, however, took me away from my norm and was surprisingly much more engaging than my usual. This book takes you from suspense to heartbreak to confusion  in seconds and you almost feel that you are the character experiencing these events. I would recommend this to anyone who loves a mystery with a different flare but I would also recommend this to young adults like me who are looking for an incredible book that may not be what you're used to but that is worth straying from that norm to read."
This was a page-turner. I was caught up in the mystery the main character was working on.I enjoyed the storyline and was surprised by the ending.
"Oh. My. God.I've been waiting at least a year to read this and it was DEFINITELY worth the wait. Normally, I'm not a fan of novels written in first person, especially from 3 narratives. But this book was edge of your sea and constantly kept you guessing right up to the very end."
"This book reads like a train:  beginning slowly without much fanfare, building speed as it rocks along, and then finishing full steam ahead to the conclusion. I was not sure I liked the main character--a good word to describe her would be ""loser.""  Yet as the book moved along, I found myself more and more drawn to her. This book is full of liars, and the surprising plot hinges on ""Whom do I believe?""  My opinion shifted throughout the book, and I wasn't sure of the truth-teller until the very end.  I can guarantee that the book will keep you engaged.  I look forward to more books from this author."
"My problem with The Girl on the Train was not the ""unreliable"" set of narrators, it was that they were interchangeable.  They were all neurotic, hiding things from their pasts and their ""voice"" was the same. The men could have been interchangeable as well. The men, likewise, were similar, sometimes tender, sometimes not, messy, sneaky and they liked beer.  This may have been a plot device to enhance the suspense, but it wore thin.  I was longing for someone to root for, but the sorry set of characters turned me off.  (I confess I had the same reaction to Gone Girl.) Good literature has memorable characters.  This book didn't."
"Why are negative reviews so NASTY? It's really okay to not like a book but why take the time to rip it apart? Why all the anger? We are all looking for a more civilized world and people (women...more women will read this book) PEOPLE - IT'S JUST A BOOK. This women sat down, put the effort in, wrote a story, and sold it. Even if you didn't care for it THINK about the entire process and give your honest opinion without the snide comments.My opinion: The book was fun to read. The ending wasn't spectacular but it fit. Book clubs would have a great discussion with this one.Easy read, page turner, and clever plot. Take a chance and read it."
"Sorely disappointed and difficult to follow especially on a device - had a hard time figuring out who was who and who belonged to who - finally had to write down a flow chart so I didn't have to flip around in my Kindle. And Rachel - honestly, she was ridiculous ---are there people really and truly that stupid? I know there are people who are stuck and cannot make a good decisions for various reasons, but Rachel takes the cake. Not worth reading. Sorry I wasted time on this book."
"First couple chapters were a little confusing with all the different entries, but that was part of the intrigue. Didn't want to put it down, it kept my mind wandering as to who the real suspect was. I hope the movie is as good as the book (highly doubtful). Can't wait to read more titles from Paula Hawkins."
"I knew this book was popular but didn't know anything about it. It's sort of a ""whodunit?"" I loved the layout and writing style of the author. I had no idea where it was going and I did not find it predictable. I highly recommend it."
I read this book because I saw the movie was coming out and I would always rather see the movie AFTER reading a book if the book is good. I heard many good things about the book so I bought it. It did not disappoint. I have read other suspense novels that were better by the way the author introduced the characters and developed them I would have to peek back and see which person I was reading about sometimes. Worth the read!
"Every now and then I read a mystery thriller that I just can't put down. This is one of them. I was waiting for Rachel to work through her alcoholic figures and arrive at the truth. Although I figured out who the murderer was, I still enjoyed the way the author revealed the guilty party."
"The first two-thirds of the book were a cross between tedious and enticing. The detailed experiences of the three women and their inner turmoil left me drained, and questioning why I kept plodding through the pages of these screwed up lives. At the same time, I didn't want to take a chance that I'd miss a clue so I'd ""chew"" on every word thinking it's got to reveal something I will need to know to help solve the mystery. The last third of the book proved to be a downhill slide where I no longer had to work at analyzing content and just got to enjoy how all the loose ends cleanly wove together. I'm glad I stuck with it!"
"I don't think I'm a good person to comment on this book since I have 2 brothers that are alcoholic, so I was very frustrated with the lead being in a haze much of the time.  My friends and fellow book-club friends loved the book, as well as the movie.  Having had a brother die from alcoholism, I got angry at the deceipt of the lead character, even though their was definitely enough room for some pity.  It is a quick read."
"Competent but uninspiring use of language. Overall, it felt contrived probably because the author deliberately help back critical pieces of information at the time when it would have be natural to tell them in order to keep the plot suspenseful. The characters, especially the three women at the center of the plot were simply pathetic who simply could not make good decisions. I almost gave up a couple of times but in the end finished it. For those of use who cut our eye-teeth on mysteries and thrillers, the end was about what I was expecting. Overall, disappointing, especially in view of the build-up."
I really enjoyed this book. It usually takes me months to complete a novel and I am always looking for the next page turner. The Girl on the Train was it!  I thought the character development was well-done and the relationships among the different characters very believable.  Plot twists and turns kept me intrigued and always wanting to read the next chapter rather than put out the light on the nightstand.  Well written narrative descriptions of the English countryside made the story seem all the more real.  A must read for those who appreciate Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl and other books of that ilk.  I can't wait to see the movie!!
"Wow, and I thought ""Gone Girl"" was disturbing; this one wins the prize! The main character is so dysfunctional that I can't tell if she was supposed to be certifiable or just delusional. In any case, I found it hard to stay with the plot because of that...but read it to the end, because there is, of course, a mystery that needs solving, and that pulled me along. I'm supposing that the ending was supposed to be a bit of a surprise, but my suspicions were well-developed enough by then to not really be all the surprised. Still, it's an entertaining read."
Very slow read.Too much repetition. Disappointed
"This is one of the worst books I've ever read. Gillian Flynn should be insulted that her book, Gone Girl, was compared to this inane book. It was boring and repetitive. I was tired of reading about Rachel and her drinking problem. Luckily, I only paid $1.99 on bookbub.com."
"Rachel was a drunk. Her character did unbelievable things, as in, not believable. Anna was self absorbed, unfeeling. Megan, ruined, broken, boring. One interesting twist but delivered in a skim the pages way. A book is good to me if I can't skip pages. I could skip whole chapters, so, so so, ho hum. Don't see what all the fuss was about. Despicable unmemorable characters. Maybe if I cared more for at least one of the characters, it would have been better."
"This is the story of three awful women.  If they formed a support group and if support groups had mottoes, I suggest that theirs would be “I needed this, so I gave myself permission to take it.”  And what do awful women end up with if not awful husbands and boyfriends?This novel is in epistolary form, except that chapters are in the form of morning and evening diary entries instead of letters.  In addition, the chapters aren’t in chronological order.  So one woman’s narrative is followed in the next chapter by another woman’s narrative from a year earlier.  It was a little confusing at first, but it wasn’t hard to get the hang of it.Rachel, the protagonist, is the most well-developed and interesting character.  In addition, the scenes are sketchy.  But in every other respect, what the writer does for the beginning two-thirds of the book, exhibits a mastery of detail and pacing, particularly in Rachel’s narrative as she makes her way in these urban and suburban settings.  These chapters have fine literary qualities, enticing the reader to continue.However, the writer doesn't smoothly integrate this literary first part of the novel with the overall detective mystery orientation.  The last third of the book (the “caboose”, let’s say) becomes a regular mystery story, written in more of a mass-market paperback style, but the first part makes it all worthwhile.As we gradually discover more and more about Rachel, some readers might find it depressing.  Without giving too much away, here’s something to help you hang in there.  Rachel’s second worst vice, her lack of respect for boundaries, is what keeps her from succumbing to her worst and most deadly vice.This is not a good gift for the younger kids.  There’s cursing, gruesome violence andheavy drinking.2.88 stars"
On the same plain as Gone Girl but with characters that at least drew your sympathy and empathy.  In Gone Girl I could have cared less about what happened to the characters.  Girl on the Train's characters were more human and had traits one could relate to.
"This book is no ""Gone Girl"". Everyone was comparing it to Gone Girl which in my opinion was the best book I have ever read. This book was ehh just okay. It was confusing for the first 20% of the book. Overall I was a little disappointed maybe because of the comparison I had too high of expectations."
"I was recommended this book by everybody - the suspense, sex, murder - thrilling! I wont be able to ""put the book down."" And, almost of the reviews were fantastic. So of course, with the movie premiering in the near future, I wanted get in on all the excitement. This book just did not live up to all the hype for me at all. Maybe it was my low tolerance for Rachel's misery but her self-pity was just overdone. I was screaming ""GET IT TOGETHER!"" enitrely too much.The author's writing style was also unfavorable, particularly in Rachel's narratives,  as there. was just. too. many hard. stops. coupled with her utter confusion for 95% of the book. It made it difficult for me to empathize with her. I think it's difficult for any woman to read about a female character so weak, so victimized, no will power, no strength or love for herself for the entire duration of the book.it was dizzying and so frustrating to read.I'm wary of watching the movie as I was annoyed throughout reading this book. I don't regret reading the book, I regret spending money on it. I should have just lowered my expectations or waited to see the movie."
"This basically seems to be about two young women, one of whom views where she used to live from the windows of a train which stops at a signal every day when she is aboard.  The other lives there  In the end one gets murdered by a friend and the other stabs the murderer with a corkscrew.Have to admit I skipped a lot of the book.  Not really my kind of book."
"I found the switching of the narration between the three main female characters to be confusing, especially as the time was not consistent I kept having to refer back to previous chapters to get time context. About one-third to half-way through I struggled to be bothered to finish the book. In the end I did persevere, if only to find whodunit."
"While not high literature, this book was a well written psychological thriller. I read it for a book club and they all agreed it was a fun read. We all are looking forward to the film, which is apparently set in US and not London."
"THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is a psychological thriller that is told from the viewpoint of three different women: Rachel, Anna and Megan. All three women seem to have something to hide.Megan, who lives with her husband Scott, next to the train tracks, dreams about her past life and where she used to live. Even though the house was filthy dirty and infested with mice, she seems to always be dreaming of her life back in Holkham. And now instead of running an art gallery, she is a babysitter for a baby a few doors down from their flat. But she hates that job. She wants something better. Someone better. Someone she can tell her secrets too. Maybe like the man who shows up whenever Scott isn't home? Someone other than her therapist?Anna is Tom's wife and mother to Evie. Tom was a married man that got her pregnant. He divorced his wife and married her. They moved into the house that Tom and his ex-wife lived in. All her friends told her that she was insane for moving into that house. His ex-wife will just not leave them alone. If it weren't for her, Anna's life would be perfect. But wait, wasn't there someone far worse than her? Someone who is trying to take away her happiness?Rachel is a divorced woman whose favorite thing to do is drink. She just can't seem to leave any type of alcohol alone. In other words, she is an alcoholic. Her husband Tom had an affair that produced a pregnancy. He divorced Rachel, married the ""other woman"" and now husband, wife and child are happily living in the house that was once Rachel and Tom's. The train that Rachel rides to London and back each day takes her past her old neighborhood. From the window of the train she watches another couple who she has given names (Jess and Jason) and has created a fairy tale love life for them. However, the couple does not have the fairy tale relationship that Rachel has given them. A murder occurs and Rachel becomes caught up in the investigation because of what she has witnessed on her daily train rides. But even Rachel doesn't know everything.The twists and turns in this story are many and readers will be drawn into the underlying mysteries. Many reviews claimed this book to be all and end all of a brilliantly written story. However I didn't see it that way. I'm not saying it was a bad story. It just wasn't what I expected it to be after all the great reviews. It did however hold my interest. I just wish the suspense would have started before I got half way through the book."
"You're really in for the greatest thrill when you're second guessing yourself after every page. If you are a fan of thrillers this is a must read. So, glad I picked it up after leaving it in my carousel for so long, disappointed that I didn't read it sooner. If you are empathetic and have the slightest bit of anxiety this story will take you for an intense ride."
"Good mystery, but slow in developing.  Could have used some better editing.  The first-person style of not just one character, but of the three main female characters made it hard to follow as their styles were similar.  Would have been better told in third person.  This might be a book that is better as a movie than as a book. In fact, with the limited geography, it could be done as a play."
"Why oh why is this book on the best sellers list? Because of people like me who think the book will be good? It was compared to ""Gone girl"". Not so much. No twists in plot line. No characters that I remotely liked. I almost stopped reading the book a dozen times but kept thinking that it would get better because of the great reviews. Well I wasted my time. Very predictable, very boring. I am happy to be done with it."
"I really enjoyed this book, and finished it in about 3 days of picking it up intermittently. It is similar to Gone Girl with the changing voices. You grow to appreciate where each character is coming from. I would definitely recommend this book, but I felt the ending, while a good twist, got a little cheesy. There was so much deep unfolding of the layers as you got through the book, that it seemed like a rush way to wrap it all up into an explanation. Not distractingly bad by any means, but I do think the ending could be slightly better. No matter what, I really enjoyed the journey, though!"
"Overall I enjoyed this read. It was quick and held my interest. However, I don't know if I would rate it as high as everyone who told me about the book rated it. Maybe there was too much hype around the story for me and being let down was inevitable. I didn't get invested in the characters and never had a doubt that it would all work out well in the end. I'm glad I read this story and would recommend it as a beach read. But it is not the type of book which will stick in my mind long after reading. In fact, I found it somewhat forgettable."
"The twists and turns in this creepy thriller are plotted with precision and well-timed. The premise of this book is fresh and inspiring; I loved the idea of glimpsing something from a moving train. However, the deeply flawed characters are all such a hot mess they tend to bleed together, without much of a distinct voice. I did figure out the ending when I was a little over halfway through, but the author did a great job of throwing me off the trail. It's a fast-read, perfect for the beach or weekend."
"This is one of the few novels I've read where I didn't liKe any of the characters. I can feel sorry for Rachel, her situation, her background giving me a reason not to hate her, but I don't really like her. It's a bit of to read a novel where I can't think like any of the characters, especially written in first person like this novel is. However that it's what makes this book stand out to me. No one is ""a good person"" and fatally flawed in some way. I've given it only three stars because while I appreciate what the author did, I can't say I enjoyed the book."
"At first, I didn't understand the hype around this book. I didn't like it. The beginning is really sad. The characters are all very flawed, marred by their own vices. But getting towards the end, the plot suddenly twists and everything you expected to happen doesn't. You thought you knew the characters but then you learn the truth. No one is who you think they are. You're just as surprised as the characters. The author straps you into a rollercoaster of a dramatic triumphant ending.Wow! What an exciting read!"
"In my opinion, the book dragged on too long.  While most of the characters were well-defined, some were not.  i also found it improbable and implausible that it would take the main character so long to figure it out, even with the added complications of her battle with the bottle.  i know she is not necessarily supposed to be likeable, but i felt kind of blah about her, and rather impatient as well."
"I agree with those who described this book as Hitchcockian.  I felt a bit like a voyeur as each of the character's fatal flaws come into clear focus, but if I am typical of many people, I constantly wavered in my views about whodunit.  It was hard to like any of the characters, which seemed like an exposé in many ways of modern life.  But thrilling it was -- I only wished it had gone on much longer."
"I had high hopes for this story.  but it left me....underwhelmed.  I thought it was really slow to get off the ground and kind of never did.  Plus I became disgusted with the protagonist and her drinking binges and bad choices and lack of personal responsibility.  I thought all the ""bad"" guys were pretty predictable.  I hate it when I figure all of them out in the first couple of chapters.  But seriously, this story had no other place to go than where she took it."
"For me this book started slowly.  I almost put it down.  The two main characters were not the kind of people I would like to meet.  The third character is more interesting, but we get less of her, because it is her disappearance that drives the plot.  The book becomes more interesting as we readers want to know what happened to the woman.  I am not a great fan of mysteries, because most of the time the crime is ordinary and the reason for the crime is pedestrian.  For me, a good mystery must have an interesting protagonist and antagonist.  This book had neither, and, therefore, was not a compelling read for me."
"""The Girl on the Train' by Paula Hawkins is an interesting book to say the least.  The chapters are not numbered, but each chapter is titled with the name of one of the three main women characters (Rachel, Megan, and Anna) and is told from the words of that character.  The male characters are, of course, important as well, as one of them turns out to  be a murderer, of one of the main female characters.  You'll have to read the book to find out who the victim and murderer are.  Suffice it to say, that your suspicions will switch back and forth as you read the book.  Despite of some strong language the book is worth reading."
"This story caught my attention right away.  You just had to continue reading to see what was really going on.  I really enjoyed reading it.  This book reminded me of the writings of one of my favorite authors Ruth Rendell.  If you are a fan of English authors, whether it be mystery, suspense or just good story you will like this book.  The similarity I found between the writings of these two authors is not the reason I liked it so much it was just an added bonus.  I hope that Paula Hawkins writes another one soon to see if I am right. And, if so, she establishes her own followers of readers that say she is a favorite."
But I kept hearing about this book. I really liked it. A lot. I like that it came from the point of view of the victim and the characters all who may have killed her. The main characterRachel got on my nerves be she Was so weak. But as the book unfolds you see the chinks in other characters armour-and Rachel's weaknesses and issues are pale in comparison to others!  Nobody is always what they seem.This kept me reading and guessing -close to the end I had pretty much figured it out.  Looking back I wonder if. I should have gotten it earlier! That's fun reading. I was in suspense. Give it a read. You won't be disappointed
"Wow... Not what I was expecting... which was a great first summer read... I could not put this book down... Just as I thought I 'knew' another twist... Dark and mysterious, but not scary. A real psychological thriller. I don't want to say too much to give it away for others, but I found myself thinking and wondering between times I had to actually read. Bravo for  first novel!!  My disappointment is I can't run to the library for others written by this new author."
"The unreliable narrator in this suburban murder mystery provides most of the interest, particularly if you've ever drunk enough to black out. But ultimately it's contrived summer reading (that has already succeeded in becoming a screenplay). Think Gone Girl with less sleaze, more character development, a dash of feminism, and just as many plot twists. Some real clunker cliches distract from the fun ride. Read it fast and enjoy it for what it is."
"I found The Girl on the Train a redundant read expecting a climax that didn't arrive. The protagonists path and her interminable ruminating on her train rides, I felt deserved a more satisfying ending. For me it read, like a long short story. Traveling through life using a vehicle like a train seemed such a good idea..."
Seldom is there a book with not one character worth knowing.  Seriously disliked this book.
"This was a very interesting book that kept you guessing and going in one direction then another.  It was a bit confusing till you were able to get the rhythm of the author, and the time sequences.  When you think you have it figured out you are abruptly taken in another direction.  You can feel for Rachel the main character as her life is spiraling downward.  Anna seems to have the perfect life great husband and daughter,but she wants to leave their house and move elsewhere.  Megan ends up in both lives and is the key turning point to everyone."
"I can't believe this is #1 on the best seller list. Interesting beginning...looking out the window of a train and day dreaming about the people you see out that window. But, then it became so repititious. How many times do we have to read how drunk Rachel is, what she drank, how sick she felt and on and on. The story could have been easily condensed. Then there wasa rush to explain the murder at the end. I was very disappointed. I also couldn't find one likeable character. (Not that this is necessary) I added 4 star because it's a good book for summer reading. Many will enjoy the mystery."
"I was told this book was on par with ""Gone Girl,"" with which I strongly disagree. The plot was nowhere near as masterfully twisted. I wasn't pulling my hair out while reading this, lamenting how terrible it was... but I wouldn't say I particularly enjoyed it. The subject matter was kind of depressing (an alcoholic divorcee who cannot keep it together and another young woman who goes missing), and by the end, I kind of hated every one of the characters."
"I'm not certain why this book has been compared to Gone, Girl.  To me, it was written very differently and outside of a woman being missing and the husband being a suspect, they weren't anything alike in my opinion.This book was picked by my book club and I had a hard time finishing it.  My problem was that I disliked each and every character, but especially the main character, Rachel.  She is a person who makes the same decisions to drink, black out, then wakes up confused but knowing she's ""done something bad"".  She phones her ex husband on a regular basis, drunk, crying and/or  harassing he and his wife; she sponges off her roommate who for some reason puts up with her drinking and passing out constantly.  Rachel goes through a repetitious cycle of drinking, blacking out and waking up knowing she has ""done something bad"".  The thing is, she makes the same decisions over and over.  I wanted to personally slap her midway through the story and thereafter.  I nearly stopped reading it several times.I could barely get through this book and the only reason I finished it was to find out what actually happened to the missing woman.  Other than that, save your money and get it from the library if you can take reading about characters who are the weakest people you'll ever meet."
I did not like this book.  But because it was on the best sellers list I felt I had to finished reading the book hoping it got better.  I still wonder why it is still get great reviews.  I must be missing something.  I have to say everyone that I have talked to about the book did not like it.
"Disappointing after all the raves on this one.  Writing style of jumping from one character to another over diff time spans was unpleasant and unnatural enough, then the sad accounting of the alcoholic heroine and reverie of misfit acquaintances was troubling, not informative,nor emotive, nor mysteriously appealing."
"The book starts out a bit slow in the beginning and becomes a little tiresome switching between three different points of view of three different characters. Each character has a similar depressed viewpoint and the repetition begins to wear down on the desire to continue to read the book. The ""twist"" will most likely become obvious to most readers earlier than author may have intended which will make getting through to the end a chore. Despite the comparison by others, this book is nowhere near as good as Gone Girl."
"Rachel cannot get over the pain of losing her husband Tom to another woman, Anna.  Every morning when she goes to work on the train and every evening she passes by the Victorian home she once shared with Tom.  Her pain is palpable and excruciating to this reader anyway.  Anyone who has experienced that level of betrayal will be moved by Rachel's pain as she watches Anna not just living in her old home, but with all of its furnishings and decoration all put together with such love and joy, such happiness in her safe, warm marriage with Tom.  Their only disappointment was their inability to conceive the child Rachel so desperately wanted.  They try IVF, but it fails and Tom says he hasn't the money for another round.  This is the beginning of Rachel's slide in deep depression that she self medicates with liquor, finally becoming a full blown alcoholic.  Her pain becomes ever more acute as one morning from the train she sees Anna, belly busting with the result of her fecundity.  She is watering Rachel's roses.Rachel isn't actually going to work on the train.  She was fired three months previously for returning drunk from a three hour lunch during which she grossly treated and subsequently lost a client.  But she rides the train anyway to mms make her friend and roommate, Cathy, believe she has a job.  A few door down from her old home there is another house, identical to Rachel's. A young couple live there.  He is strong and protective; she is ethereal,, elegant and blonde.  Rachel names them Jason and Jess and constructs a rich, imaginative and blissful marriage for them.Rachel drinks so heavily that she has blackouts.  Not  losing consciousness, but while chunks of time that are completely lost  to her, of which she has no memory at all. But something about the tunnel beneath the train tracks brings up feelings of dread and fear.  Something bad happened here, thinks Rachel.Meanwhile Rachel continues to bother Tom with drunken, tearful phone calls and even goes to seek him out at their old home, which she still thinks of as hers.  Tom tries his best gently to make her go away, take care of herself, go to AA, but Rachel's calls and visits continue until finally the police are brought into the matter.Meanwhile, Jess has gone missing.  Only Jess is actually Megan and Jason, her husband, is Scott.  Rachel takes it upon herself to play detective leading her to discover to the near loss of her life, the horrifying identity of the killer."
"I have to say I got sucked in after all the 5s reviews, but I just can't believe we read the same book.It is incredibly slow, the characters are: flat, stereotypical, non likable, and just so dumb I felt like shaking them.I would have rated it 2 stars, except for the fact that somewhere around the last 50-75 pages It finally felt interesting.Still, don't get what all the hype is about."
"What an over hyped book this is!!  I'm sorry but Hawkins is simply not a good enough writer to carry off three Distinctly different first person interwoven narratives. Not even close! All three women sound alike, and that's not just because they are all eminently unlikable.  It's because Hawkins isn't adept enough. Maybe she will be one day. But then again, this is hardly literary and she's probably laughing all the way to the bank!!"
"I only read this book because it was so highly rated, and my Kindle kept telling me I would like it, but I didn't. At all. The story and characters were so unrealistic, unnecessary sub-plots were left unanswered which made them all the more irritating, and the ending was simply ridiculous. I would have given more stars had the ending been slightly believable."
"This was a decent read... not my favorite. The story was interesting, and followed a similar plot/twist as Gone Girl, but not as good.If you're looking for a great read of this type, skip this one and go straight for Gone Girl!"
"Psychological thriller which starts inside the mind of a ""girl on a train"" Rachel who takes a train ride every weekday which passes the house that she and her first husband shared - which is now occupied by her now ex-husband and his new wife. Rachel is also an alcoholic and deeply disturbed by the failure of her marriage and her failure to have a child. The story develops and the action is described by the three women (including Rachel)who are involved in some way with her ex-husband. Each chapter is headed up by who is telling the story and the date - both of which are important to understand the flow of the action. In reading you can imagine how easily this could be made in to a film - and indeed a film has been made starring Emily Blunt as Rachel. It has been compared to the thriller ""Gone Girl"" and I believe that comparison is a good one. Like the best thrillers the action accelerates and it becomes unputdownable until you finish."
"I loved this book, reminded me a lot of ""Gone Girl' if you liked that book, lots of attention to small details, you felt like you knew  the characters inside and out and  the author allows you to really feel what they are going though, their thought process.  I will say the first couple chapters were a little slow but once I hit about the third chapter I could not put the book down, I had to keep going to find out what happens next."
"The stylistic writing riveted while introducing us to the deep point of view of the flawed protagonist and building to a satisfying climax. This unique take on a whodunit mystery was fresh and anything but cliche! At times I loathed the drunken Rachel, but Hawkins made her so three-dimensional that I usually understood her motivations and could even sympathize with her decline and admire her very human tenacity."
"I usually read textbooks (teacher) or non-fiction (history teacher) so not many novels are in my library.  However, I must say that this one kept me reading and trying to guess ""the twist.""  Similar to Gone Girl in that regard; I knew there had to be an unexpected twist but I didn't get it until it was revealed near the end.  Kept me away from Suduko and Words With Friends, so that's a pretty good recommendation!"
"One of the best novels I've read in a long time. Mind you, not the best, yet worthy of five stars. For me, to give a novel five stars I have to love the main character(s), and I never want it to end. Although it was hard to like any character in this book (in fact, all are unlikable--at least until the end) I didn't want to finish this novel. It is definitely a ""who-dun-it,"" trying to figure out which of the unlikeable characters did it, and it is fun trying to figure out who did. When you do, the novel does lose a little of its punch, but not much. Therefore, to me, this novel earns the full five stars."
"The characters all seemed to me to be a little ""nuts"", from the alcoholic who fantasizes about the people she sees from the train to the womanizing, murderous ex-husband as well as the fragile Megan.  Rachael really was a total nut case, to the  extent of involving herself with Megan's husband and even visiting her therapist.  The whole thing was as improbable and implausible as could be.  The book is a pageturner with far too many coincidences.  Was Hawkins thinking of this as a movie?"
"This was not an easy book to get into!  I put it aside many times. I felt that it dragged in many areas.  It seemed to take forever to figure out exactly what was going on.  Once I was able to get pass all the pussy footing around, the story did start to get exciting.  I really felt sorry for the main character, Rachel.  She was going thru a very rough time and loved to fantasize about a couple she saw daily.  As the story unfolds, you realize that Rachel really has problems and not just mental ones.  A good read if you don't mind the dragging out in the beginning."
"This book was really amazing I wanted to see it before the movie came out an honestly  didn't know that much about it just that it had a good  rating. It was truly a page turner with many unforseen twists an turns. It's  not one of the super morbid books either that will leave you awake at night wanting to erase what you have read from your memory, just enough suspense to keep you reading an on the edge of your seat."
"Definitely worth the read! I found the beginning of the book rather slow, but it definitely picks up speed as you go. I also didn't really like any of the characters at the beginning (the main character, Rachel, seems quite the pathetic drunk) but as you get further into the book you learn why the character's are how they are. Overall, this book reminds us that people are not always what they seem and we should put ourselves in others' shoes before we too harshly judge them or to quickly trust them."
"In true mystery/suspense form, the tale unfolds bit by bit, giving you just enough to guess at who the murderer is. None of the characters are simple and flat; that's the bit that really makes for compelling reading. If you've dealt with drug addicts or alcoholics, then Rachel's bizarre choices make sense. Plus, she's relatable because who hasn't done people-watching and made up their stories? The fixation/obsession part eventually makes more and more sense. Not one character is 100% evil or courageous or even lost, just like real people. This is a very good novel that reads ""real."""
"I really enjoyed this book. Truly a page turner that's hard to put down, and I haven't come across a book like that for awhile. I originally shied away from it because it was being compared to ""Gone Girl"" which I thought was pretty awful, but this is not even in the same league. The writing is so much better and the characters are actually believeable, unlike Gone Girl. It's not literary fiction or anything, but solid writing and a storyline that keeps you wondering what's coming next. All I could ask for in a book like this."
"I love to read so I was curious to read this book because of the positive ratings and reviews. I even had a friend recommend this book. I found this book hard to get into although I read it to the end. The main character was annoying, the reading slow and confusing at times and just not a book I found interesting."
"I truly do not understand the popularity of this novel. Average writing at best, unlikable/exasperating characters, preposterous plot...These elements can be successfully combined in the hands of a skilled writer--take Gillian Flynn for example. Paula Hawkins possesses no such talent."
"The book is extremely well written. The machinations inside the minds of the characters are fascinating.The deep philological twists and currents of  addiction are splayed open for the reader to view with startling honesty. This book is a deep look inside the mind of tortured soul, all wrapped up in a fairly complex mystery. Now for why I took off a star: Without spoiling the plot, I will list 3 reasons: Remember the heroine from the old films who decides she just has to go alone into the dark basement forbidden hidden room on a stormy night... with the power out... with no protection... hearing strange noises...after being threatened...barefoot...in nightgown... Now, imagine the heroine does this over and over again. Really? The book starts off with at a really slow pace and the train only picks up a little speed in the last few chapters.The angst and agony of the tortured soul becomes whining and weak when the 'victim' is caught in a cycle of self destruction. Wash, rinse, repeat. I left my review at 4 stars instead of dropping to 3 was due to the wonderful writing ability of the author, a good mystery, and the half cup of hope tossed into the rinse cycle."
"You will like this book if (1) you've always wondered how an alcoholic thinks, (2) you enjoy reading about spousal abuse, and (3) youenjoy reading about infidelity and violence.  Sorry I bought this one."
"Disappointing. It felt like the author was trying too hard to be suspenseful and thrilling. It shouldn't be compared to ""Gone Girl"" because readers would expect a lot. If you're a love of suspenseful mystery thrillers, this is NOT recommended. I figured out the entire plot line once one of the characters narration came in."
"finished reading this book after I had heard it was going to be made into a movie.  Originally started three months ago, but stopped because I really did not enjoy reading about an alcoholic.  Then I thought maybe it would get better as I read further.  It did not.  Not like Gone Girl despite some comparisons.  Finished only because I forced myself."
"Too depressing for me.  I love good mysteries, but this was so joyless and about halfway through I guessed who did it.  I know a lot of people loved it and that's why I bought it, but I'm sorry I did."
"Unreadable, don't buy it."
"When I first started this book I couldn't get into it for some reason. Put it down for a couple months then picked it back up only to not be able to put it down until I finished! It was a great read. Suspenseful, with a main character you love and hate. She's weak and whiny but gains strength as she uncovers the truth."
"What a fantastic page turner, murder mystery, psychological drama with three really troubled women each telling their story.  Rachel, an out of bounds alcoholic with an out of bounds imagination and jealousy; not a very likable person, for sure, but I did keep rooting for her.  Megan, hollow and shallow and haunted by her past and Anna, the young, naive, trusting, suspicious wife and mother......Add three flawed men and you get a marvelously written gripping, entertaining delight. Wish I had been on a long plane flight and not trying to distract myself from the election.  Did not come away with any profound insights about life......just loved, loved the marvelous, entertaining distractions; the details of modern day transportation (trains) in England.  Yes, it is a bit depressing and dark; but it's a murder mystery...Isn't that what reading is all about?"
"I initially read a sample and by the time I finished reading it, I had to have the entire book to see what happens. I used to take a train to and from work, and over time, there were things and people I noticed, and I imagined all sorts of scenarios for them, and subconsciously built rituals around different parts of my journeys.  Thus, the book resonated with me.  A well-written, psychological thriller.  I finished it in one reading.  Because I had to."
"Nothing much to this book or the characters. Heavy drinking, lying, cheating, blackouts. That's about it. I guessed who the murderer was very early in the story. Who else would it be? The female characters are all pitiful victims. There are 2 abusive male characters. I'm glad this book is over. Yuck!"
"I did not find this book all that interesting or exciting - despite all the hype! I could not relate to any of the characters. They are all rather pathetic and sad.- especially the main character who abuses alcohol and can't get over her ex husband. Come on! Time to move on! I think I have had enough of the psychological thriller type after 'Gone ""Girl""."
"This novel has spent years as a hardcover and e-book bestseller before being issued in paperback where it is predictably on still another bestseller list.  A movie is also in the works so I doubt what I have to say is going to make an impression.  I won't go into plot details because plot twists are the book's main attraction.  Numerous previous reviews have mentioned that the plot relies on unreliable narration.  However, this narrative technique isn't new and didn't originate will Gillian Flynn whose three novels I much preferred to this one.  Authors such as Wilkie Collins and Agatha Christie have also used it to better effect, and no, I won't mention which novels to avoid spoiling them for you.  Be aware that this novel starts very slowly relying on two quotations before the first chapter to entice the reader to go further.  Maybe it's best to wait for the movie or better yet watch Hitchcock's Rear Window which is far superior to the novella which inspired it  and which has as an added attraction the pre-Perry Mason Raymond Burr."
"I agree with others who found the characters all so interchangeable and vile, their dialogue one lie after the other. The author's use of 3 first person monologues ever mixing was so annoying, though I get why she did it. It got so I couldn't tell who was doing the talking half the time, that's what I mean by ""interchangeable."" They were all awful, awful people. I got so frustrated with this that I rushed to finish it so I could be ""rid"" of it for good. Not one redeeming factor in any of these characters, all utterly without morals or apparently, will power... they deserved the misery this book was. I will skip Ms. Hawkins' next work and I don't intend to go see the film just released of this. My curiosity has been fed. But I had to see for myself if this was worthy of all the hoopla being made over it. Not in my world. Another ""Gone Girl""? Not even close."
"This book was a great light read, good for someone who has been reading intensely and desires a cheesier plot to give their mind a break. Plot was simple, so it can be pretty quick as well. However, I chose this book hoping it would live up to stellar reviews about a truly dark and twisty novel, expecting it to truly disrupt me. Unfortunetly this is where I found my disappointment. Paula Hawkin's came up with a great concept idea, but it feels like she rushed through the writing to pump it ou as fast as possible. The background, emotional descriptions, and especially characterization lacked depth. Would have loved to seen this plot taken a few steps further! Still, would recommend for a light read you don't have to think about. Also: don't even bother with the movie unless you are getting it for free."
"The girl on the train , Rachel, is depressed, her self esteem is very low , she loses contact with reality and fantasyses. She is lonely but does not look for help.She has a bad relationship with her mother and lies to her.She has never overcome the loss of her husband. She acts on her own while knowing that alcohol blurs her mind. Besides curiosity takes her to interfere into other people's affairs.She misleads the investigation .I found the novel a bit slow , it only accelerates in the last chapters.The characters are dark and full of inner conflicts.Rachel has a very low self esteem, she is depressed and drinks. She has not overcome her marriage failure .She interferes and tries to manage on her own.She is lonely ; even the relationship with her mother is distant.Megan is unhappy and wants to leave everything behind, she even tries a relationship with her psichologist and later we are told that she has had an affair with Tom.She has had a dark past.Anna is also unhappy, has left her job Gallery to look after Evie and is haunted by Rachel stocking her.Later she does no longer trust her husband and she even reads his private mail.Male characters play as second characters , only at the end Tom gives a step ahead.There are no happy characters here.I found it difficult to jump from characters in the different chapters and it tired me a bit.The end was surprising and the rythm accelerated and became attractive."
"Almost everyone I know has read this book. I wish they had warned me that the first half of the book was five or six characters in search of a plot-line. The girl on the train was an emotional trainwreck, whinging on and on about her past while she drank herself into blackouts. The other characters that were presented were similarly self-absorbed. At about the halfway point there was some development of a storyline and it quickly became obvious who the bad guy had to be. The final quarter of the book quickly laid out the storyline, solved the riddle and revealed the culprit -- no surprise.If you liked ""Gone Girl"" this is similar, but not comparable. The characters are so nebulous and self-absorbed that it was impossible to care what happened to them. The plot wandered a lot which could have been interesting, but somehow it was not. I gave it two stars because it was well-written."
"Reminds me of a  current Alfed Hitchock ""Rear Window"" movie thriller with Rachel, a young women who drinks too many gin/tonics and is depressed because of her divorce and inability to have children. Little does she know other married couples from their homes near the railrod tracts from a distant live a very different life then what she projects in her faulty imagination and mind. The end is quite thrilling with many twists and turns. Good read!Steven P. & Merrily W.Beaverton, Oregon"
"I definitely was duped here. When the title is something as creative as ""The Girl on the Train"" its really my fault for thinking that it would be interesting in any way. It starts off very slowly and you keep thinking that it will pick up at some point, but it takes so long that when it actually does get going you are well past the point of caring."
read this over a  year ago...not sure if first person or not.  But a good read.
"A tantalizing murder mystery with many tangled plot threads the reader is deliciously challenged to untangle . I couldn't put it down once I really got started . I found some of the dialogue and situations a bit suffocating, and the main character truly weak and hard to relate to , which makes for a bit of a depressing read in places, but nevertheless believable and consistent with the plot ."
"I could not put this book down.  Once I caught on to the style of switching first person narratives, I found the action intense and swift moving.  I was surprised at the end, but I won't spoil that for the reader of this review.  I would have loved to have been in a book club for this one!"
"I read this book expecting so much more from it. The main character has zero self-esteem, and her drinking bouts are tiresome. The other characters are unlikable and shallow.  The ending was not what I expected, but the author dropped clumsy red herrings all over the place, as if even she hadn't decided who the bad person was going to be.I wish I had read the other negative reviews before picking it up. I would not of wasted my time on it."
"If you like suspense, this is your book! Once I got into it, I couldn't put it down! If you are a fan of Alfred Hitchcock as the author is, you'll notice some similarities. The book is unique in that each chapter is told from a different person's perspective.That being said, you may want to keep a cheat sheet at first so you get to know who is who. I must say I did get a little lost in the beginning.Once the book grabs you, you're hooked & you won't be able to put it down. You'll think you know how it ends but you'll most likely be wrong until the very last minute.An amazing book!"
Interesting but one of those books where you want to choke the main character.
"This book has received great reviews but I have to say ""I"" am not a fan.  I didn't care for it from the beginning but kept reading.  It picked up about half way through.  It took half the book to set the stage - too long for me.  I continued reading and finally, painfully finished it.  There are twists and turns.  The ending was a surprise.  BUT, I found the characters psychotic (they were) and unrealistic.  I would not recommend this book.  Too many good ones to pick from."
"I started this book several times.  Finally, I committed to reading it!  I had to take notes on characters and what was happening during their timeline.  This helped me follow the story better.  All the characters are flawed.  So, it is a bit like Gone Girl.  But, I did enjoy trying to figure out who committed the crime.  I was surprised at the ending.  So, hang in there and discover for yourself whether you like this book.  Could it be a good movie?  Hmmmmm,  maybe."
"The women in this story are all such wimps, moaning around about the men and allowing themselves to be bullied and abused.  I felt like some whiny ""he left me and I'm so sad"" music from Adele should be playing in the background all the time.  I cannot figure out why it's so popular.  Are all young women this hopeless?"
"This is one of those books when you finish you just to have to ponder it for a few minutes.  I thought it was a good book because I had to finish it, but I can't say I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The main character is not exactly endearing--most alcoholics are not--but she had a willing and good heart.  This is a terrible pun but reading this book is like staring at a train wreck you just can't look away and therefore I just  to see how it all sorted out in the end.  While this doesn't seem like a favorable review I'd loved for my friends to read just so we could talk about the balance of the relationships between characters."
"I had read some reviews and believed this would be a good read.  Maybe, but not for me.  I found it annoyingly pathetic.  I just could not like any of the characters nor identify with them.  I finished it as I was hoping for a good ending.  No such luck"
"I'm not sure I fully understand the hype behind this book. Maybe it's that I'm a sci-fi/fantasy fan at heart, so this work of nonfiction seemed extraordinarily bland to me. I found myself unable to relate to the alcoholic, depressed protagonist who just longs for a child and a husband to make her upside-down world turn upright again. The book was well-written I suppose, but the ending seemed really obvious to me, given where her obsessions and therefore her blind spots were. I subtracted two stars because of my boredom when reading and the predictability of the ending, especially after the first half of the book. However, I was able to completely finish the book so it couldn't have been *too* boring, so I'll leave the remaining 3 stars up for now."
"Quite a quirky novel with an alcoholic young woman as the main character. Full of intrigue and suspense, and though none of the characters were likeable, I thoroughly enjoyed the unfolding plot and ultimate denouement."
"Not of the same caliber as Gone Girl.They just made a movie out of it and made comparisons to Gone Girl which I had read.  It is not of the same caliber as Gone Girl.  Gone Girl was more suspenseful and moved along much faster.  This book was confusing and depressing more than dark.  The main character is a drunk.  It was a matter of figuring out who killed Megan.  I will leave that to those of you who want to read this.  There really are not that many convincing twists in this book and the outcome is really not a huge surprise in my view.  The Author tries to obfuscate it but really fails as it is too contrived.  I found the first 2/3 of the book pretty slow going.  Only in the last 1/3 did things really pick up some, but then it was just letting the pieces fall into place and frankly I was not surprised in the least.  Good luck with this one.  I consider it pretty much a waste of time reading this one."
"I feel this book started slowly......a boring account of random details that jump back and forth. However, a little more than half way through I see the meaning of all those details as they start to merge together and tie my mind into a suspenseful clutch that kept me interested and unable to put the book down.Even after the ""big reveal"" towards the end there's still a lot of questions and suspense and the story draws to a conclusion. I do feel it ended rather weak.....missing that OMG feeling as I turned the last page. And still I have two remaining questions???(Possible SPOILER BELOW)1) What ever happened to Scott? Did he find out what really happened?2) Did Rachel and/or Anna tell the police about Tom & Megan??Did I miss something?"
"""The Girl on the Train” is a debut psychological thriller by Paula Hawkins who was a journalist for fifteen years before she turned her hand to fiction.  The setting of the novel is in London during the summer told through three female voices: Rachel, Megan and Anna.The protagonist, Rachel Watson is an alcoholic who witnesses a murder while on a commuter train.  However, because of her inability to remember things, her constant blackouts and incapability to separate fact from fiction; makes others not believe that she saw a murder.  Even though she has problems with staying sober and focused, Rachel is persistent in trying to find out what happened and why.I feel this is a good debut book for those that like psychological thrillers.  Ms. Hawkins has a good writing style even though I felt the action did not really take off until about the last 75 pages of the book. My deltas are I hated every character in the book because they seemed to not have any redeeming values and worked hard to hurt everyone they knew.  Furthermore, the story dragged in the middle and the ending seemed a little too pat.Overall, it had a good story line and I felt it may change how we look at the lives of others we encounter daily. I look forward to reading Ms. Hawkins next thriller."
This book was essentially told through the eyes of three women.  The women's lives become completely entwined.  The author is able to weave a very sophisticated and engrossing study of the characters in the book.  Through tout the book one will try to discern the true scenario that has evolved.
"This novel has gotten a lot of hype so I was curious to read it. BTW, I have been an English teacher for years, majored in English in college and normally do not read popular novels. So, I decided that I would read the whole thing to the end, which I did. The final chapters of the novel did reveal a clever twist or two, but the majority of the novel, in my opinion, needed a good editor. So much of the novel is repetition--getting drunk, doing something, not remembering it, etc. that after a while, it became boring to me. But, there were some good twists and turns to the plot--enough to keep me reading--so if you want a well written novel that would compare with Le Carre or Silva, turn this one down. But, if you like a roller coaster read and can just skip the reiterating of the same old problems over and over to get the the fun stuff, go for it."
"This is one of the most boring, unbelievable books I have ever wasted money on.  Forced myself to keep reading about 1/3 through the book and then completely deleted it from my Kindle.  Characters totally unbelievable, story plot (if there is a plot) utterly useless, seldom do I read a book that I can't find some good in - this is the exception.  A total and absolute waste of money and time."
The Girl On The Train is one of the best books I have read in a very long time. I read a lot and love suspense thrillers. I loved how fast paced this book was. I didn't get bored. I can usually guess the ending of movies and books pretty quickly but this one took me for a spin! It was exhilarating! I typically don't like when authors go back and forth between characters. If I can't read it in one setting going back and forth gets confusing. Because of how faced paced and exciting this book is I didn't have that problem. I was able to stay interested from the first page until the last. I was able to keep up with each character and loved how each one developed as you go through it. I felt like I was right there with Rachel through all her flashbacks. Definitely a best seller! Paula Hawkins is an excellent writer! Can't wait to see the movie when it comes out. I will be adding Paula to my list of favorite authors too!
It has not been since I've read Gone Girl that a book captivated and sent my mind in so many directions. This is a brilliantly written whodunnit that will leave you convinced at different points that it is one particular character and you'll find yourself switching back and forth.The author did an amazing job with the character development and telling the story from the perspectives of the three main female characters. This book is a must read!
"Reading a chapter or two each night was not enough.  I was too drawn in, too intrigued. So very well conceived, the story line takes a few interesting turns and it wasn't until near the end when I figured it out.  Then I had to keep going to find out why. In some ways I wish I hadn't as it reminded me all too well of my own broken marriage and the lies I was told -as the author wrote, ""even the ones that didn't matter.""  This story will continue to haunt me."
"What an over hyped book this is!!  I'm sorry but Hawkins is simply not a good enough writer to carry off three Distinctly different first person interwoven narratives. Not even close! All three women sound alike, and that's not just because they are all eminently unlikable.  It's because Hawkins isn't adept enough. Maybe she will be one day. But then again, this is hardly literary and she's probably laughing all the way to the bank!!"
"Rachel is a hopeless wretch..straddling the rails of sanity. Her story is an endless ride, going back and forth between reality and stupor all because of her fascination with Tom, her ex husband. When a young women is murdered, Pathetic Rachel feels obligated to find out why. Which brings her right back on track..Why she drinks, why she doesn't trust herself. A lot of intrigue here..and of course, true feminism discourse...blame everything on the guy. This is an interesting book. Give the author a 5 for original plot. Rachel..Give her a 2 for making bad choices."
"It was captivating reading, couldn't stop or put it down for too long. The end was most surprising . Enjoyed it"
"For the life of me I cannot understand how this book has been a top seller for so long.  I read A LOT.  And I would not consider this a great piece of fiction by any means.  It is soooo repetitive I felt like I was reading the same words over and over and over again until the last couple of chapters when the mystery finally unravels.  This entire story could have been told in 50 pages or less.... I get that the main character is supposed to be a messed-up alcoholic and she has a lot to regret but come on, people.  This is not best-seller material."
I have no idea why so many people raved about this book. I thought it was poorly written with sloppy character development and plot lines that were clumsily hatched together. I didn't care for any of the characters in the story and found the ending anti-climactic.
"How can you like or care about any of the 4 key characters?! They are so self absorbed. Rachel is a train wreck and reading this book is equivalent to not being able to turn away from looking at a horrible wreck and when it is out of sight, a range of feelings may remain with you but would you recommend the scene to others? I can't. Perhaps creating a sense of voyeurism was the author's intent and the editor's goal and they succeeded.  However the pace is too slow and it isn't a surprise ending for an ex-wife and a wife to align against an evil husband."
"No wonder it's one of the fastest-selling novels of all time! This thriller is completely engrossing, and the three women from whose perspective the story is told are well fleshed-out characters, although Rachel is clearly the standout. I did guess the ending about a quarter of the way through the book, but it had me in doubt about my guess several times and had plenty of other shocking and absorbing moments. I read it in 2 sittings. :) More Paula Hawkins, please!"
"One of those overrated novels everyone reads. It is relentlessly dark. Every major character is morally empty: liars, cheaters, drunks. And, a killer. There's a surprise , of course. The plot twist is the reward for your slog through the novel, but you'll figure it out before the big reveal. So, even that seems hollow; formulaic.It's the kind of novel that makes you want to go to the liquor store, but not the nice one; the one in the sketchy neighborhood, by the railroad tracks. For cheap wine."
"Half way through the book I had to quit reading.  Yuck, why would I want to spend any more time with these flat inane characters who have absolutely no redeeming hopeful qualities? I can't understand all the hype about this book. The beginning was intriguing and the wind of perspectives was interesting, but once the murder who done it started, I was bored and disappointed."
"I liked the premise, Rachel, watches a couple in their home from where her commuter train stops every day. She makes up a perfect life for them. And then the woman goes missing.But I agree with the reviewers who found the characters unlikable and all sounding alike. The ending included an unnecessary cliched confession. I was left with an unsatisfied feeling at the end."
"Rachel's life has completely spiraled out of control, but she is unable to break out of her routine.  But then one day she sees something unexpected out of the window of her train and suddenly she shaken out of alcohol-induced stupor.I was very late to the party in terms of reading this book.  But I can honestly say that it not only lived up to, but exceed my expectations.  Just as everyone says, this is a perfect next book for those who liked 'Gone Girl'.  But I even liked it better as the main character, Rachel, was so much more relate-able and likable.  So I wasn't only engrossed because the plot was so well crafted, but also because I developed strong feelings concerning Rachel's well-being.I would easily give this a 4.5 stars.  If you haven't read it yet, don't worry about the hype being greater than the actual product.  This book will not disappoint."
The book has a few interesting twists to keep you guessing. The author has laid out an unpredictable plot that moves you through the lives of the characters as she did in 'Gone Girl'.  Kept me reading to the end.
"I found the book okay but nothing special.  Disliked the idea that the main character was in some type of stupor due to alcohol in the entire book so it made the entire story somewhat boring.  I prefer my main characters to be in full command of their senses and have a little more realistic goals and have a stronger character. Nevertheless, it was okay but perhaps my gender had something to do about my analysis of it. Uper"
"I cannot believe that anyone enjoyed reading this book.  I hated it and had to force myself to finish reading it.  It's the first time I hated every character in a book.  The grammar was atrocious, also.  Why did she not have a professional edit the book?  I don't know how many times she wrote something along the lines of ""...neither of them ARE ... ""  SCREECH!!!  Terrible, terrible, poorly written book."
"I gave this book four stars because I really enjoyed reading it, and sometimes couldn't put it down. I would have given it five stars but for some reason I had a VERY hard time with the fact that Rachel rode the train everyday to pretend that she didn't lose her job. That she would get ready, ride the train in the morning, find something to do for eight hours, and then ride it home, just because she didn't want her landlord to find out she'd lost her job. Doing all of this while dealing with alcoholism and depression just doesn't sound believable to me. As long as she paid her rent on time, why would it matter if she lost her job?  Each chapter would be from a different person's point of view which would sometimes get annoying and confusing, but in the end made for a very mysterious and enjoying read."
"I'm guessing the author's goal was to write a book that was ugly and  filled with depraved characters since that is what's so popular now -- and that goal was met.  After reading this book, I felt like I needed a hot, soapy bath for my brain.  If you want to read a filthy book that has little suspense and no true heroes then this is for you."
I couldn't finish this one and boy did I try! It started out very well with an intriguing premise and main character. But then of course it started jumping around from first to second to third person and the story became way too complex than it deserved to be. This was a Gone Girl wanna be and I didn't care for it. Maybe one day I'll get around to finishing it.
"I love a good suspense book. This isn't it. It is 200+ pages of sad, slow diaries of people who are unhappy, one alcoholic, a couple of mentally abusive men and spouses cheating on spouses galore. You don't get any of the good parts, just the sad pitiful parts.  The last 8 pages some action takes place, but otherwise I continued to read hoping that the next page or the next chapter would be better, only to wait for the past chapter to get some suspense. I will not even share this book with anyone as they would look at me questioning why they wasted four hours reading it after I already wasted four hours to find out it was pitiful.The characters are pitiful.  Their choices in life are pitiful. I honestly can't believe anyone would publish this book and feel cheated for buying it."
A real page turner.  Must pay a little attention when switching from one of the three women narrating.  Each woman narrates in the first person. Couldn't stop reading to the detriment of everything else that was going on in real life including getting sleep.
"I found this book a bit dark for my taste, but a psychological thriller. Told from different perspectives, it's a page turner. If you're cynical about so called ""mysteries,"" this might be one you enjoy. You're kept guessing until the very end. The characters are very well developed. Makes you recall how much we all are so much more than meets the eye. But, I wish I was better off for having read it. Not sure I learned anything, but excellent drama."
"I think the device of moving dates around and repeating scenes from different characters points of view us what kept me from giving up on the story.  I have since seen the movie, and found it a weak not very engaging plot.  The talent performances were good, but I never really found myself pulling for the protagonist.  I worked my way to the end, but alas, it was a bit of a disappointment."
"Since this has been on the NYT best seller list for some time, I thought I'd give it a try.Was very disappointed in the story curve...seemed like it took forever to cut to the chase,and when you got there at last, Predictable.I normally devour good novels, but I had to force myself to finish this one.Maybe it's my 'guy' point of view, but I can see why this might be considered more appealing to those of the opposite gender since it may be easier to relate to the main character from that viewpoint, but I was on the verge of asking Amazon for a refund."
"This book is a page turner! I found myself having to put it down to get some sleep. Really interesting story. I liked the way Paula Hawkins kept the suspense going right up to the very end. Just when you thought you knew who the killer was, she changed the direction of the story. The characters were well developed. Everyone was connected in some way which heightened the intrigue. Great ending too."
"I found it a bit confusing because it kept jumping from character to another and after awhile the long descriptive phrases and the cornucopia of emotions were driving me crazy.  I was loosing track of all the double thinking and switch backs, then one girl kept going back trying to resurrect her life with her last husband but he is married to another woman and she has a problem with that.  No s***, I'm sorry I couldn't finish the book and went onto another.  It was well written but I lost it."
"This is the first novel by Paula Hawkins that I have read.  It certainly won't be the last!This is a brilliantly crafted story, told by multiple characters, all of whom are unwillingly woven into this web of mystery.Rachael, the drunken ex-wife of Tom seems to be the first one to begin to  ""stir"" this story that will keep you glued to its pages right up to the end.  Be patient in the beginning, when all the characters are having their say about this ""stew.""  You won't regret it!"
"Excellent read!  I love books that have chapters written from different perspectives, and this one does just that.  At the beginning it is confusing to remember who is who, but you quickly get wrapped up into the different storylines being told and cannot wait to figure out what happens.  Well written, good amount of twists and turns, and highly recommended!  Ever since I finished Gone Girl, I was looking for another unpredictable read, and am happy to say that I have found it in this book.  I am recommending it to everyone I know that reads these types of books."
"Can I put 3.5 stars?I DID like this book. It's good. It pulls you in. It's entertaining and you feel for the main character.I was a little surprised at just how many positive reviews it received because the quality of the writing belonged more in the genre of pop culture quick fiction. Which, I guess that's exactly what that book is.As for the deeper subject matter of alcoholism it does a nice job of showing the reader who is unfamiliar with that struggle what it looks like inside the mind of a woman who ended up there slowly and as a result of grief."
"The tone changes throughout the novel as the main character's speculation about the people she observes from the train changes, especially when one of the residents along the tracks disappears.  Then the reader begins to wonder about the mental state of ourmain character and why she is so interested in these people, and IF she possibly had something to do with the missing person as well.She meddles with the investigation and the reader has to wonder if that changes the outcome.  More of her own past is revealed throughout the book."
"I have to be honest, I’m conflicted in my thoughts/feelings about the book. It ended up not being what I had expected, but I couldn’t deny that I still kept on reading and that the whole book was put together very well.The story took a while to take off. The first couple of chapters came off as more of the beginning of a contemporary women’s fiction novel than a mystery/suspense book. Paula Hawkins really took the time to introduce us to the main players of her tale, which I appreciated having all the characters including the protagonist, Rachel, be a little on the dysfunctional side. It was refreshing to read characters with flaws/issues that can make them unlikeable but in a certain way very sympathetic and real. But as I was saying, the time spent on the character profiles (for lack of a better term) was so much that when that pivotal moment of the plot occurs, the combination of the lead up to it and the subtly of the moment, you would miss it if you didn’t know what to look for. I was expecting the moment to be bigger with more action (especially since the book basically bases its whole story off of it) and so I was a little underwhelmed when I realized what occurred. This exemplifies some of my feeling regarding the book. Perhaps my expectations were too high or I had a set idea of how the book was going to be, but it left me a little underwhelmed. It didn’t mean I didn’t enjoy, but I wanted to be more engrossed or enthralled like I have been with other mysteries/thriller/suspense (i.e. I Am Pilgrim, Night Film). One word I would use to describe the book is “quiet”. The story moved at a steady pace without any real action that left me reeling or a “what just happened?” moment that increased my need to continue with the reading. With this book I felt I had this detached interest and that I was reading because I wanted to know exactly what happened and how it will all end. Did I have that “edge of my seat”, “page-turner” feeling as I was reading? No. But it still manage to spark my interest and had good qualities that I can objectively appreciate.Upon finishing the book, I can value the way Hawkins structured the story and developed the plot and her characters. She did a good job of creating a cast that, as I have mentioned before, are far from perfect. They each have their dysfunctionality/issues that make them unlikeable. However, it’s nice to have these flawed individuals, specifically Rachel, try to make sense of a mystery when they themselves have trouble making sense of their own lives. It really plays into the issue of credibility and whether you can believe what you are reading from them which helps in the story’s plot. I actually loved Hawkins’ use of misdirection along with the multiple POVs. This is a good example where POVs are helpful in the story’s plot. It not only provided background and illustrated the inferences vs reality aspect (regarding Megan), but the information you got led you down multiple paths in what you believe was the truth and it wasn’t until the end where you realize you never truly knew what was going on. I have mentioned this before, when a book can surprise me with a twist or an unforeseen plot point, it really raises my regard for it.Would I put this book along with some of the other mystery/suspense book that I highly regard? Probably not. This book didn’t have that extra spark/energy that they did. This book is more on the subtle side that gave it a quiet and steady tone. Does that mean it wasn’t well-written and well put together? No. I can still recognize the good work it contains and praise the book and Hawkins for it. It was different from what I expected (this probably influenced some of my feelings) but that doesn’t mean the book was bad."
"Why would someone get involved in someone else's life that they don't know at all? The characters are all over the place and very static. All the characters have character flaws which makes them seem real but they are not likeable characters. Overall, a very well written book but at the end of the day a story that doesn't seem believable."
"The ending of this book was something else! It was interesting to see how the characters in the book intertwined as the story progressed. Some people might feel the beginning is slow but the readers need to get to know the characters, and the challenges they face in their lives."
"Everyone told me to stick with it, so I did.  But there aren't any characters with any redeeming qualities.  The men are all horrible people and the women are all dysfunctional or dead.  Not my idea of a good time, personally, but everyone else seems to love it!"
"I was so excited for this book, and I am so genuinely disappointed. There was nothing original or ""thriller"" about it plot-wise, the main character is highly unlikeable (there are no redeeming or even EXCITING or INTERESTING qualities about ANY of the characters, but the main one is just an unlikeable, bland, boring person), and the whole book is really very boring until the last 15 or so pages, and the action that fills those pages is VERY predictable. There's no plot twist, there's no hero or heroine, there's little to no character arc/development. The only reason I finished it was because I kept hoping for that spark or twist or something that people kept raving about. I would give it 1 star, but I feel that it does have potential to be a good movie if done correctly; I'll be seeing it."
This was a mediocre read.  Others compared it to Gone Girl which was a trashy beach novel at best.  The Girl on the Train was better written and was certainly able to convey a decent story without stooping to literary profanity that insults the reader's intellect the way Gone Girl did.  All in all it was an ok read however it was not good enough to entice me to seek out other work by this author.
"This book, read from the perspectives of three different women on divergent and convergent timelines, leaves quite a bit to be desired. Paula's writing is difficult to follow, the characters are mostly unlikable and make very questionable decisions. Common sense is apparently lacking in this particular part of England.What started off as a novel premise eventually meanders its way into half-truths, mis(sing)-information, and lots of ""surprises"" that are less surprises and more like the guy who tells a joke but has to keep going back and adding in more detail because he forgot. This frustrating novel is really just a  long joke, with lots of ""oh yeahs"" and ""I forgot"" (literally).If all of the characters involved got hit by the titular train I think this book would be more compelling. Alas, that's not the case and we're left with the sour aftertaste of characters ripped from a Maury Povich show."
"I didn't realize that there were 2 main characters until 20% done--I decided this was not a novel to read on the Kindle. There's no easy way to go back to check how the novel is set up, chapter heads, etc.  I found that going back and forth between 2 similar characters was confusing to me."
"I purchased this book because of the raving reviews. Many said this was the next Gone Girl. However, I found this novel very difficult to read for several reasons. First, there are many perspectives and many time lines happening during the book that I wasn't paying true attention to until about a quarter of the way through. For ex. One perspective takes place Fri in Aug while in a few pages the next perspective takes place Fri in June. The second reason I found this novel difficult to get through is the main character. She is a drunk that I had a hard time empathetizing with. Character development was extremely slow. Half these chapters didn't even need to exist. I felt as if she was just nonstop whining about her life, being drunk, and hating her life. Not a pleasurable read in the least bit.I tried several times putting the book down and starting it back up again in a few days but I just couldn't finish it. I like to read for enjoyment. If I wanted to read about a drunk who couldn't keep a job I would just go on Facebook."
"What happened to an intriguing plot? Why was this book published? The characters were relatively flat and mostly unlikable. I feel like I just wasted several hours of my life reading this book. The writing wasn't terrible but it wasn't great, either. I got no satisfaction out of this story. Nothing like Gone Girl in terms of a (somewhat) satisfying story."
As good as advertised.  I have not seen the movie but this book is excellent.  I wasn't sure at first because the book is written in chapters of 3 women and I wasn't sure I would be able to keep them straight but I had no problems.  Don't worry about the dates they really don't matter to the story because she writes its a way that it is easy to know when the events happened.  Great book!
"I found this book's format to be similar to Gone Girl. Characters' points of view were expressed by each chapter.  Most of the book is retrospective of events, however, I found it difficult at times to follow each characters individual timelines as I tried to resolve the mystery of what exactly happened to the missing character.  At times, the plot didn't hold my interest enough to continue reading. I know that it's a best seller, but I just didn't think the quality of the writing warrants the attention the book received simply because of its format."
"The concept of the story is good, but the book rambles on and on with a predictable two page conclusion.  Don't waste your money on this one."
"I know this novel has been on the best seller list for quite a time, but I found it rather long and somewhat tedious. The rantings of an alcoholic woman through her ""streams"" of consciousness perhaps could have been conveyed in a more compacted style. The basic story line was interesting but had all too many excursions."
"I should have known when I struggled to get through the sample that I wouldn't enjoy this book. I kept reading on hoping it would get better. The suspense is not thrilling, the plot is laughable and the protagonist is absolutely insufferable. The only reason I bought it is because it's a ""bestseller"" and they're supposedly making a movie out of it and every time I hear those words I have to read the book first. Shouldn't have bothered."
"Although the story was riveting I felt like the author use too many run-on's  and made it hard to follow by bouncing the date back-and-forth. Not to make a spoiler, the extended and repeated talk about one of the characters alcohol consumption was done it too often and seem to drag on. The fact that character was an alcoholic was beat to death. The storyline still was good and twisted."
"Good mystery, but slow in developing.  Could have used some better editing.  The first-person style of not just one character, but of the three main female characters made it hard to follow as their styles were similar.  Would have been better told in third person.  This might be a book that is better as a movie than as a book. In fact, with the limited geography, it could be done as a play."
"I read the reviews for this book and found many varied opinions. Because it has been on the best seller list for so long, I finally decided it must be good. I admit the story line is different and quite depressing. The timeline was very confusing - current for Rachel, but past for Megan/Jesse.  I had read 40% of the book before I finally got interested in it. I do not like to start a book and not finish it. I am retired and have plenty of time to read; however, if you work and have limited time, I would suggest you choose something else."
"Entertaining.  A bit predictable, but kept me engaged and guessing until the end.  I am not a fan of the multiple character POVs now trending in novels.  I have a tendency to get the ""voices""  confused, and this adds a degree of frustration.  And though THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN limits this style of writing to three characters, I still got bogged down and often had to pause and think, ""Now which one is this?""  This is what prevents my giving the book a five star rating."
"The Girl on the Train was a pretty engaging book.  My BFF and I are taking a ""2016 reading challenge"" and January was to be a book that was made into a movie, so this was our choice. The main character isn't very likable, in my opinion, but she doesn't need to be in order to hold your attention.  I could sympathize with her struggles to some degree, but overall she was a hot mess.  Without saying too much, I think the conclusion of the book was solid, if not a little predictable."
"It's hard to like a book when you dislike all the main characters.  I wanted to like this book.  However, all of the main characters were horrible people, and,  in the end, I didn't care what happened to them because whatever horrible things happened to them they deserved 10 fold. I truly can't imagine why it's getting such good reviews.  I do think it might make a better movie than a book, though."
"OMG. I wasn't sure that I'd like this book because I haven't read a psychological thriller in a long time. At first it seemed mundane, yet I was only a handful of pages in... And then? Then the story shifted to another character's POV and I could see everything from that person's perspective. And then it shifted yet again, giving me glimpses into the lives of a variety of characters so that little by little I was allowed clues as to what was happening. This is a story of deception, the lies we tell ourselves and others, the way lines get blurred by emotions or alcohol, skeletons hidden in the closet, and the secrets that we keep. It's a story about how things aren't always what they seem, and Hawkins had me turning pages to find out who was up to what. The greatest part? Each time I decided I knew exactly what was going on, Hawkins led me down another path to make me question if what I believed was happening was the truth. This is a must-read book that will make you want to call in sick just so you can finish it! (Please note that I didn't use a sick day, but I read through lunch breaks and at every spare moment I had, desperate to discover the truth behind everything that happened to the girl on the train, and desperate to know who was going to survive the madness.)"
"I will start by saying I do not usually read these types of books. They're just not really my style or something I've ever been interested in. But I saw the trailer for the movie online and it looked interesting. When I found out it was based off a book, I decided to try it out given the great reviews.I really cannot say enough how much I enjoyed this book. I read it within 15 hours - 7 for sleeping and I also have a toddler at home so not a lot of time to myself. And that was after I had googled to see what happened (I know you're not supposed to, but I hate getting invested in a book only to have the ending piss me off). I still wanted to keep reading even though I knew how it ended. The writing in my opinion was fantastic - there are so many great lines from this book that I have saved. I am really looking forward to the movie coming out and to future books from this author."
"Where do I begin? How about lack of plot: It's 100 pages before someone goes missing and another 60 before a body is found. Characters: All the male characters are either verbally, emotionally or physically abusive or all of the above and yet the female characters can't help falling in love with them because they are so ""manly"" in their verbal, emotional and physical abuse. The female characters literally put on makeup, wash their hair and change their outfits 4 times because they are meeting a man to talk and then tell them how they talked with that other guy and ""ohhh look he's jealous, Now I can be happy!"" Mwahhhhhhhh....it is paragraph after paragraph of the following (l'll paraphase):I'm soooo bored sitting at home taking care of the baby while my husband's at work. I never thought I'd be 30 sitting at home (I know being a mother is the most important job in the world!) but I can't wait for my hot husband to come home so we can have hot sex. But I have no direction in life, most days I just want to push the baby in the pram to the park looking sexy so other women's husbands with look at me with lust in their eyes. Oh look the baby fell asleep...yeah, now I can go grocery shopping and after I'll pop in to the shops and buy a (insert designer name brand here) dress because I DESERVE IT.Again, mwahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..hahahahah........this is a best seller??? Being made into a movie by Dreamworks??It doesn't get any better. The title character's daily life can be cut and pasted from any given chapter. Again let me paraphase:I feel so guilty because I drank 2 bottles of wine and passed out and I have no memory of what happened because I was passed out but I'm sure I did something embarrassing, bad, or stupid. Wait, let me check my phone/computer. Oh no, while I was drunk I drunk dialed/texted/emailed my ex. Now I feel even more guilty and the only way to get over feeling guilty is to go to the off-license and buy 2 more bottles of wine and get drunk again BUT I have to hide my drinking from my roomate. She goes to the gym and eats salads so she disapproves of drinking. Wait what was she trying to talk to me about while I was vomitting on the carpet. Oh yeah that new salad place that has such great salads.Again, hahahahaha. The level of writing does not rise above those paraphased snippets and once you guess who the killer is the ending is so predictable. If you really care about details such as the character having an affair keeps a secret cell phone hidden from her husband in a shoe box at the back of the closet and the shoe box is labelled...dun dun dun.... RED WEDGES, this book is for you. Because the husband wouldn't dare open a box of red wedges???Me, I want my money back. If you are looking for a journalist turned fiction author thriller to read, I recommend Alex Marwood's The Wicked Girls. It is a much better read. That book should be made into a movie instead of this one."
"This was not the worst book I have read this year. HOWEVER is was not a very good one either. I bought it in Hardback, something I usually reserve for authors I know and love. I was moved (won't make this mistake again) by all the hype and good words about it. I was sorely disappointed. It was just confusing, and uninspiring. A short book like this is usually at the most a two evening read. I knew it was bad when a week later I'm only half way thru. I finished just because I had paid for the thing, and some part of me kept hoping it would get better. That some where between the lines would be the story that everyone else seems to have fallen in love with. It was not worth my money, but even more important it was not worth my time and energy.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
"Terrible story, terrible characters, and just plain awful. I didn't care about anyone and didn't care what happened. I don't know how this book got on any best seller's list. I kept hoping it would get better. Ugh. I just can't recommend this book to anyone and I'm not sure I want to give it away because I don't want anyone to know I read it. Save your money."
"I read 60% of this book only because it is on the Best Seller List and I kept thinking it would redeem itself.  It reminds me of a whiney woman who is very sick…… going on and on and on…….. Certainly not for me…… I read books to enjoy, not to become depressed.  Of all the books I have reviewed, this is the first that I have felt is a real 'downer'!"
"Wow! Great book and now a movie soon. Love a suspenseful novel, though I read in bed at night and it takes me a liitle longer usually to finish this book. But this one kept me up till the wee hours. Good thing I work at home."
"I saw the movie and was enthralled by it and decided I had to buy the book. I can't watch movies after I read the book because the movie is so much less than the book but since I was so entranced by the movie itself I had to have the book and it was just as seductive and more so than the movie. I am able to appreciate both this time though the book will always be better in my opinion, but the movie conveys the same feelings as the book and to me that is what matters. Maybe I identify with Rachel on some levels and that's why I enjoyed it so much. Like a dirty little secret. She could live out what I can't, but in the end I would read this time and time again because of the masterful way the emotions were presented and the story was told."
"Enjoyed this book a lot. I read it in two sittings because I was obsessed and couldn't put it down. It did skip around a bit between characters from chapter to chapter, but overall, I liked it. I will say, I was looking forward to seeing the movie- it was terrible."
"Begins a little slow, but soon becomes hypnotic and addictive. Usually, in crime novels you can see the perpetrator a mile away, but this book actually surprised me. Author builds the suspense and drops clues flawlessly."
"It appears that I am in the minority, giving this novel 3 stars. Readers either love it or hate it. Which is fine, and is the  purpose of having reviews published. When you find reviewers who seem to like the same books you do, you're more inclined to consider other books they liked- that's all. No better, no worse, just different.So, on to the three star rating: This was a light summer read. I personally did not care for the author's style of writing nor how she presented the plot. There was too much focus, I thought, on how much and in what ways, Rachel got drunk, for example.  I got it. She's a raging alcoholic. No need to elaborate on each of the many incidents. And some of the events seemed just too unbelievable. As if someone could sneak into your home, drunk, take your baby while you sleep next to her, then run outside with her and not wind up in jail on attempted kidnapping charges!In addition, I wasn't crazy about the author's style of writing. If you haven't read the novel: each chapter is presented from the point of view of one of the 3 female characters, written in the first person. I began to notice that each started to sound like the others; same way of speaking, even the same expressions, at times. I found it difficult to differentiate among them, since they sounded the same. And since they are all deeply flawed, they needed more character development in order for the reader to find something redeemable about any of them. The reader needs something to hang on to- empathy, sympathy, relate ability- in order to care about a character. I didn't find this to be the case.Perhaps some of my disappointment here lies in the fact that I had just finished All The Light We Cannot See. Beautifully written and developed. Talk about caring for the characters... wow.I am not sorry that I read the book. It is a quick, somewhat entertaining read. Not something you have to dedicate part of your life to. And I can see why it has its share of devoted fans. Even if I am not among them."
"I wanted to read this book despite the movie bring out in theaters. I could have easily just gone and seen the movie, but something told me to read this book. I usually don't take the time to read a book if the movie is out. However I'm so glad to say I resisted the urge and bought this book instead. I have never I mean NEVER read a books do well written, so well thought out. The perspectives the twists, I cannot believe people can write like Paula Hawkins. This is a must read. If you've seen the movie, if you haven't, READ THIS BOOK. I'm still in shock, this book is so well thought out I cannot believe something so psychologically thrilling could be written into a book. One of the best books I've ever read. Thank you."
"I have been hearing about this book for months. It drove me crazy, Rachel , Anna, Meghan. Not one single character with any redeeming quality. Took awhile for me to get use to the chapters on by each character. But when I did I could not put the book down.Maybe it I could have enjoyed the book instead of trying to figure out what was going on. Did it entertain me yes. Would I recommend the book in a word no."
"A got drawn into this book as much for the story about the dark journey of an alcoholic hitting bottom as for the tale of whodunnit.  I felt the author was quite good at detailing with accuracy and nuance the bizarre, guilt ridden, unreasonable inner world of a woman lost in blackout drinking.  The main character is pathetic, but she is sympathetic enough that I found her ultimately heroic.The author adeptly crafted a whodunnit tale with enough twists and turns, weaving a web of storylines with just enough believability that kept me guessing long enough.The authors strength was her keen understanding of the human mind at it's darker limits, reminding me a bit of what I loved so much about Crime and Punishment."
Great book! I love that the author made me care about all of the characters! It was well written. I absolutely wanted to read this book in one sitting! Looking forward to seeing the movie but I'm sure it won't be as good!
"I wasn't sure that I would like this story, it was too Gone Girl for me, but then I read on. This story was a roller coaster slide through a crazy world. Some turns were predictable, others were not. It was a great read!"
"I became interested in this book after seeing a preview of a teaser of the movie featuring Emily Blunt which is coming out this year. After doing some research, the summary sounded intriguing and I decided ""Why Not!?"". So glad I did.I couldn't put this book down and read it within two days of its delivery! Even covering my reading light with the comforter so I didn't disturb my parter. He appreciated that, haha.The story is told from different viewpoints, keeping you guessing as to who did what until the end. I've heard it's similar to Gone Girl, which yes, I have yet to read or see the movie...gasp, I know! But, if you like the mystery, who did it book type of storyline, then I recommend checking out this book. Now, just waiting to see how Emily pulls off the lead character."
"The book is poorly written.  It moves from one character speaking to another and all the characters spark in the same voice.  The last third of the book becomes more interesting, but I knew who the murderer was by about half way through.  I read it for my book club.  If you don,t have to read it, skip it."
"Amazing book, crappy ending. I finished this book in 2 days. I couldn't put it down but the ending left me perplexed. The characters are all jerks. The story is great, it just felt like the ending was rushed and that last line. Really??  I would suggest it because it is a good read, just not what I thought it would be!!!"
"Wow!  An intelligent mystery that the author did not phone in!! In so many novels purporting to be ""mysteries,"" the reader figures out the so-called bad guy before halfway throgh the book...or, worse, the book ends with an improbable villain thrown in almost as an afterthought....but you will need to pay close attention in this read. And...note that different women narrate different chapters....or you will need to begin again as I did, when I got lost ...thinking my original storyteller stayed the same. (I said the book was intelligent....not this reader who began ploughing through the first chapters as though this were the typical fluff piece of writing)  You will soon see for yourself what all the clamor was about this. novel. It is good!"
"I generally try to use reviews to choose what I wish to read in part. After reading a few reviews, I kind of knew what I was getting into. I did not expect the tone of the book to be what it was though. It was dark, somewhat twisted- no, I mean a lot twisted. The characters all had personal demons. Wading through the trough of the harsh lives, cheating and treachery of the characters, I tried to see a thread of where Ms. Hawkins was taking the story. Brushing the fumes of alcohol aside and the blackout laden plot, I started to have my own theories build. The theories waxed and waned. I solved the mystery 4 or 5 times before enough detail became evident to reason it out. It was a good effort on Hawkin's part. I don't know if I would put it in the same class as "" Rear Window"" though. It is just another type of story- I think that's why I gave it the 4 stars. The lack of the final star is a common complaint I have of these types of novels. They introduce all at once a part of the plot you could not see at all- nor imagine. It is not a bunch of chess pieces scrambled on a board that slowly rearrange themselves to reveal a final end. Instead these types of stories create critical clues out of the blue that fill in vital pieces of a picture never possible before the clues are revealed. I'd rather have all the pieces laid out there and when the fog lifts, you find yourself saying"" I should have seen it! Great job"". Nevertheless,  it was still a good story, filled with the sick helpless feelings being lost and depressed if things in a ""perfect world"" we're to suddenly go bad. You might want to go outside after finishing this book and look out at a clear sunny day and praise the good fortune of being healthy, happy  and trusting enough to believe all people have good in them. With this book Ms. Hawkin's cuts through this ""good"" as fantasy and paints a different picture of what we are or can be. Somehow, the will to survive and rising above it all- hoping we are still decent at our core may endure. But, you will have to read it to see if that is true."
"I really wanted to like this book more than I did. First off, here is the positives:I like the story telling device of switching between points of view, it was really cool, especially when you see a particular situation from a different point of view. It was a compelling story and had aspects of a thriller which made it a page turner. Even though it is a British author and set in London, there aren't too many ""British"" phrases that will make an American have to guess. Only a very few times did I need to look up what a particular phrase meant. I think the author has written a good book.Now for the critical part.(Spoiler free)- Even though the non-linnear story telling was awesome, sometimes it took some rereading to figure out what day it is (or what time it is in some cases)- There are some inconsistencies in details, I can't think of a specific example right now, but it's almost as if the editor didn't do a good job or the author should have been more thorough in her characters back stories and situations.- I thought the device of having Rachel be an alcoholic was interesting and did lend to the story, however, it seemed like Rachel had ""Hollywood Alcoholism"" - broad characteristics, and able to turn it off at a moment. Sure she focuses her energy on something else, but as a person in recovery myself, you (or at least I) couldn't just ""forget to have a drink"" and maybe thats just me, but it seemed odd that she could turn it on and off so frequently.- The biggest of all, however, is the lack of back story for Rachel. (dead father, mommy issues, roommate) All of these influence the type of person she is, yet there is nothing to expand on why she is like she is other than a passing mention.SLIGHT SPOILERS BELOW- The red hair guy serves zero purpose and only confuses things more. I feel like too much time was wasted on that story arc, or rather not enough time was spent to make him an important character. Totally useless, and not even in a red herring sort of way.- Rachel and Scott: Why did they have sex? Again served no purpose to the story and wasnt plausible based on the story telling. The attractive young, recently widowed guy, who had a smoking hot wife, would not have sex with a frumpy, unkept woman. Or if he would there was not a lot to his story.- Kamal - I feel like he got put ""on the bus to Mandyville"" (look up the trope if you dont know what it means).- Also, the detectives investigating the murder are the stupidest characters ever written. Its kind of like the detectives were from an unpublished comedy novel that happened to fall into this manuscript.- Finally, without a major spoiler... the ""who-done-it"" reveal was too much of ""the butler did it"" and it came out of left field. All of sudden we were at the end and the murderer is revealed and it doesnt really make sense other than ""of course!"" - which is not a way a thriller should end."
"I must be very slow I did not realise that the book was in three voices. I thought what a bunch of losers, who needs this much misery. But then the story got me in, I wanted to know what happened, to work it out. I gave it 3 stars because it redeemed itself after a bad start"
"I am an avid reader and was excited to purchase this book (after reading so many great reviews).  This book was boring and the storyline was just disappointing to me!  The alcoholic first wife, the new wife, the neighbor wife..too many wives!  Would not recommend this to someone that likes fast paced books!"
"I liked this better than ""Gone Girl"".  Much better character development and none of the sexual scenes, and much less violent.  Moving on can be hard to deal with as the main character experiences."
"I tried, but could not get interested in this woman....I felt like i had to keep notes to keep track ...so I got about 1/3 through it and said this isn't fun and put it down...Upsetting to think I spent my kindle money on a very boring book."
"I wanted to love this book, but I was disappointed. The characters are shallow and boring. The ""girl""  and other  female characters are weak and present as victims. They have been mistreated, but fall into the don't help yourself mode of dealing with their circumstances. That's not me. The structure of the book felt contrived- as in I don't have an interesting tale so I'll add a confusing format. The telling was tedious and only got interesting near the end and then there was some additional prose that seemed to have no purpose as an ending. I'm sure it will be an entertaining movie w the right actors, but the book was a flop for me."
"Very disappointing read.  The four main characters seem to live in a vacumn with no clues for the reader about what motivates them.  Rachel, the main character is annoying and I could not muster up any empathy for her.  Flawed characters are often fascinating, but not in this story!"
"It takes a while for the reader to get passed the fact that none of the narrators in Paula Hawkins, ""The Girl on the Train"" are likeable reliable narrators.  All three of them have problems, their commonality a residential street of houses that backs the train going in and out of London each day.  As all three narrators get their turn to tell their story, the reader pieces together that they are connected in even more intricate ways.  Hawkins does a superb job of keeping the suspense up without revealing much of her hand until the very end of her tale.A young wife goes missing; one of the first person narrators, Rachel, knows the missing girl--she's observed her in passing from the window of her commuter train.  She wants to help the police; she wants to help herself.  She needs a new starting point in life because her husband has left her for another woman . . . and now they have an infant daughter.Hawkins writes of disturbed people whose faces are raw with shame and self-pity.  Her mystery revolves around need.  I listened to the unabridged audio presentation of this book; the performance gets high marks for theatricality and poignancy.  The narrators all have their flaws--there are no super human stereotypes here; together their voices pull together to find a light at the end of a dark tunnel at their own expense.Bottom line?  Some might find the characters too disagreeable to give them time to work their simple magic.  Make the time; this thriller is quietly exciting and chilling in its every day reality. Recommended.Diana Faillace Von Behren""Buzzard's Eye View"""
"I finished this book a few days ago after several people at work started reading it and saying how good it was, so I of course had to read it. But whoa was I not prepared for my mind being blown and all over the place with the writing style. I enjoy a book that gives point of view from different people don't get me wrong,but when there is so much switching back and forth and with dates involved it becomes too much. And once I finished I sat there for a good 5 minutes still in shock, because of who did it and my unanswered questions. Overall I would say I liked it, but it won't be a book I would read again, it took me well over half the book just to get into it like everyone else did. But it's worth a read, and four stars."
"I really wanted to like this book.  It was too predictable.  Maybe all the election #50/Shades/of/trump stuff was too much in my mind.....  And it was well-written; No disrespect intended to the author;  It's the subject/main theme of the book that is beyond obsolete....  I didn't feel any connections with any of the characters; their development was too shallow, or something...  This is one instance where the movie might be better than the book; The Agatha Christie book with the same title remains my favorite....Younger people will go for this though, I'm sure...a generic read to be sure, I'm afraid....Again, no disrespect to the author; I've been reading 4 decades or so now...  It's very hard to find a good read these days..."
"I so wish I could get my money back. I wasted dollars and time on this silly, poorly written endeavor.  So irritated that I got suckered by marketing and positive reviews by people who obviously can't distinguish good stories from cheap trash. Just ugh."
I didn't expect this book to be so dysfunctional after reading the book jacket & customer reviews. I found it difficult to stay with it & actually stopped reading it for a while.  Every character had some new form of dysfunction which became very old very soon.
Don't waste your time.  Hard to follow because the characters and the time period switches back and forth. The Man character is a drunk and is not stable.  It is hard to follow.  I do not understand why so many people love this book.
"I did enjoy this book, but it wasn't the best by any means. It was rather slow moving, which was intentional I believe. But it made it hard to get into and push through. Keep going though, it is a good read."
"I don't really know what to say about this book.  I couldn't put it down, the story was gripping, and heart wrenching.  And yet I hated every character.  Rachel perhaps redeemed herself in the end but Anna, Megan, Scott and Tom....wouldn't want any of them in my life's story.  And yet perhaps that's the point and that on some level they are in all our lives.  The choices we make, the fears we have, our weaknesses and willingness to look the other way for love are all a part of this original descriptive story.  Fans of Gillian Flynn (which I am) will definitely want to read this book."
A bit confusing if you don't watch out for the chapter titles. The chapters are written from different character's perspective's ! This can be confusing .and a little upsetting if you miss the change.
"Very boring start, depressing dialog, it almost seemed like we were repeating the same situation on every page. A glimpse of a possibly interesting character that fizzled out. It must have been me because it's been on the NY Times bestseller list for months. I"
I was anxious to read the book as there was so much pre publication hype. I think overall it was just disappointing. I found the chapters jumping from woman to woman sometimes confusing. The story line had so many characters and really none embraced me. I am still trying to figure out the man on the train. Predictable characters....ending a bit far fetched....just disappointing!
"A real disappointment. There are no likeable characters here. They are all miserable people who deserve what they've gotten. Even Rachel, the main character, doesn't deserve sympathy or respect, not because she's an alcoholic, but because she continually makes stupid decisions, even when she's sober. Okay, so the murder victim didn't deserve that, but this character is also repugnant on many levels.The book gets a second star from me because author Paula Hawkins did manage to have me convinced the murderer was one person, and only in the last few chapters did it turn out to be someone else."
"I was hoping the book had more to offer than another simple entertaining story, and it blew my expectations out of the water. The story itself was not dull, but if you also take time to analyze the characters and plot a bit you will be amazed."
"I downloaded this book to read based on reading the short Amazon plot summary above.  I didn't know anything else about the plot and, had I known a bit more, I probably would have chosen a different book to read while on maternity leave.  That said, the storyline of the book is engrossing (if depressing) and pulls you in, but I was not blown away by the writing.  It's a good option if you are looking for a quick read... Just not while on maternity leave."
"I am an avid reader and I'm very rarely surprised by twists in books; typically they are blatantly telegraphed from early on in the book or are unsatisfactory.  I don't want to add spoilers that would ruin the book for anyone else, but I do recommend this book as an exciting and frustrating (in a good way) read.I got this book as an audiobook initially, and I highly recommend this format.  The narrators do an excellent job, and really add to the suspense and intensity."
"This book is often compared to Gone Girl, a comparison that is understandable if not exactly true. With intriguing characters telling a complicated and suspenseful story, The Girl on the Train is definitely worth a read if you're looking for a fun and easy to read thriller. The characters are nuanced and intriguing and the story is told with plenty of twists that keep the reader engaged - actually that's quite an understatement as this page-turner kept me up past my bedtime just so I could find out what happens next!"
"Great read! Keeps you on your toes, entertaining for sure. As I rarely read thriller like literature I don't have much comparison but I'm happy I followed friend's recommendation to give this one a try. I tecommend it further."
"I was thoroughly confused at first because I did not notice the heading at the beginning of each chapter.  I thought the story was being narrated by the same person and it made no sense.  Then I happened to glance at top and there was the name of the person ""talking""!  Completely made a difference.  Once that was established I was able to make mental conjectures that came out  the way I expected.  Well written and an interesting twist in the inter-woven lives of the people the girl on the train saw.  Have recommended it to others."
"Pretty good read, but I expected better after reading and hearing the hype about this book. I had figured out most of the ""who done it"" fairly early on. A bit dark for my taste, especially with the alcoholic problems the main character has, but that is probably intended. Set in London, it was interesting to read some of the descriptions of different areas of the city and the commute many people who work there experience.  All in all a good mystery with a surprise finish.  I gave it 3 stars; would have given it 3 1/2 if possible."
"So, I just finished this book. I have to say, it kept my attention for sure. I did like the alternating points of view, and the concept of a girl riding a train and observing lives from afar, and suddenly becoming involved in those lives was good. I sympathized with Rachel at first, but I soon became annoyed with her ridiculous behavior. Some of the characters were not as well-developed as they could be (Tom, Anna) and the ending felt very rushed and not in line with what I had come to know about the characters by that point. Good effort, needs some flushing out. A film, done right, would be interesting."
"The only reason I gave this book 4 stars and not 5, is only because the main character is really hard to root for.  She is a compulsive drinker and blacks out a lot.  Her black outs play into the story, it is just annoying as to how much she drinks.  Other than that, I felt the books was well written and very easy to get drawn into.  Heads up: The story takes place in and around London, so some of the vocabulary that was used is not normal words to Americans.  There wasn't a lot of British words, but wanted to make sure readers know."
"Love, love, love this book!!! The main character is such a mess in the most relatable way. It had me wondering what was real the whole time I was reading it. I absolutely flew through this book. If you like Gillian Flynn, you will like this book."
"I LOVED this book, until I got to the end.  The exposition and explanation of what really happened was presented in such a bad-movie villain fashion, as in ""This is what I did and this is how I did it!! bwahaha"" totally killed the book for me and left a bad taste in my mouth.  Maybe it bothered me so much because the rest of the book was so strong.  I read it in a day and was very much enjoying it until the big reveal.  Probably a good choice for a book club, there is a lot to talk about what you like and what you don't like."
"The story is interesting in the beginning but it sort of drags on too long. I felt myself getting tired of reading the same stuff over and over again. I also found it a bit confusing as the author goes back and forth with a chapter on one character and then the next chapter on another. Also, the times are confusing. I wasn't sure when she is talking about the present verses the past. The end does have a nice twist to it. I don't think I will read books by this author again knowing how she writes. Too bad because this book was highly recommended and I found it a little disappointing."
"Okay.  This is one of those books that everyone said, ""you must read this,"" and so I did.  I think every book club has it on it's list.  It is a mystery, but also a good psychological study.  The characters are well defined, and there are a lot of twists, turns, and surprises.  It was the mystery, and not the writing, that kept me reading.  This is what I would call a good 'weekend reader' or a good 'beach book.'  One doesn't need a dictionary or a PhD in literature to 'get it.'  It is fast moving and I enjoyed the British-isms immensely."
"This book was so depressing in the beginning that I thought, really? This is what everyone likes? Thankfully, I kept reading, and realized why everyone likes it. I like multiple POV's almost always - shifting timelines, I like less, and in this case it was a little confusing, but worked well in the end. Very suspenseful. 4 stars instead of 5 because of the depression factor (which was really only there in the first 25% or so), but mostly because the timelines kept confusing me. That aside, enjoyed this book all the way through and now I want to un-read it so I can read it again for the first time."
"Avoided this book for awhile since the sample read was depressing. But finally read it and found it to be more depressing than the sample could ever cover. May be right up a lot of people's 'alley', but not mine. Author is very good at creating characters, just ones you love to hate or want to slap or maybe hospitalize in closet Mental Health Center. Ms. Hawkins creates a 'heroine' that is so obsessed and avoids Reality that she never gets my sympathy. All in all though, I expect Ms. Hawkins to write more books and might try the next one."
"Oa never ending self loathing heroin, who drinks excessly drinks and has occasional blackouts. The story fixates on this, and other unsavory characters. There is a back story of a mystery, but one that is less and less as the story drags on.  If you like self loathing character living badly, this is your story. I, for one, am sorry to have spent the price to buys this over hyped book."
I loved this story.  It was a little confusing at the beginning and I had to go back and re-read chapters because I thought I was missing something.  It was all part of the story.  The author let the reader figure it out.  I wasn't sure who the killer was and jumped from character to character.  Not until the end did you figure it out.  Certainly kept me interested and I would read more by this author.  Can't wait for the movie!
"Aside from being a mystery thriller, this book was similar to ""Gone Girl"" in a disappointing way: both, to me, had unlikeable characters. Though the who-done-it aspect of murder and lies and missing memories was intriguing, the characters become more and more self-centered. I read it because of the movie version coming out this year. Perhaps the final comparison to ""Gone Girl"" will be if the movie is more enjoyable than the book."
"Four stars because The Girl on the Train held my interest and was well-written, but it could have been five stars if there was just one character that I cared about.  This book was populated with miserable people, one more miserable than the next.  In the beginning I was hoping that Rachel, the main character would become less pathetic as the story evolved, but she didn't, and by the end I just didn't care.  So maybe, four stars is a stretch.  If you are looking for a book to uplift you for just one moment, keep on looking."
"I thought the book was great. It wasn't what I was expecting at all, but it was good. It was a bit difficult at first to get into the writing style, but after 20 pages or so, it was easier to read. I was able to read it pretty quickly. At some point, I had a hard time putting it down. I love books that are suspenseful and the plot has some surprises. I would definitely recommend this!"
"This was a crazy ride!  Told in the voices of three women whose lives become entangled with disastrous results.  One is a drunk, one is a little crazy, and the third is obsessed with jealousy over her husband's first wife, although this is somewhat justified.  Once you're into this one it's hard to put down.  What are these people going to do next?  There is some depth of character as the women ponder how they ended up where they did; why they made those choices that got them to the frightening place they all end up in.  This puts this novel a bit above your run-of-the-mill suspense/mystery."
"This was by far one of the most captivating books I've read in a while, its the type of book that sucks you in from the very beginning and has you eager to know what happens next. Full of twists and turns and the perfect amount of suspense. You won't regret reading this, and you won't want to stop reading until you know what happens."
"I have to say I got sucked in after all the 5s reviews, but I just can't believe we read the same book.It is incredibly slow, the characters are: flat, stereotypical, non likable, and just so dumb I felt like shaking them.I would have rated it 2 stars, except for the fact that somewhere around the last 50-75 pages It finally felt interesting.Still, don't get what all the hype is about."
I love mysteries. I liked that he author developed an intricate plot whose ultimate reveal was a surprise. I appreciated the telling of the story from the views of the various characters as they were involved the story at the same points in time. I did think it overplayed the telling of the narrative through the clouded mind of Rachael. I constantly felt I wanted the author to get on with it...and
"I had a few theories at the end, but never would have guessed the ending. I liked how the book was set up, as far as jumping from character to character and having to fit the pieces together like a puzzle. Wish it were a little faster paced because there were a few different sections that I had to reread (which i hate doing). I'd recommend it as a ""pretty decent"" book."
"An excellent read. I enjoyed the multiple narration technique. Hawkins did an excellent job of creating rounded, individual characters. The complex plot kept me guessing about who was good and who was bad. All of the characters are flawed--like all people."
"I was drawn in immediately.  The characterization is well done.  If you think you wouldn't be sympathetic to a drunk who blacks out and can't remember the events on a night when a woman went missing.. well, you'd be wrong.  The lives of three women are nicely intertwined and not always rosy.  The author bounces us back and forth on a taut journey as she unravels the story through the eyes of each woman.  The writing is interesting and deep enough to make you see the depth of each character.  I read somewhere that this is Ms. Hawkins's first novel.  Hard to believe."
"The Girl on the Train is a story written from three character perspectives that are connected through marriage and divorce. The main character Rachel is Tom's ex-wife who is addicted to alcohol and consequently works hard to retrieve memories of an incident that happens to her one night. Through her train rides into London, her ex-husband Tom, Megan's husband Scott, and Tom's current wife Anna, Rachel puts the pieces together to find out what happened to Meagan. This is a riveting account of Rachel's attempt to make sense of the mystery!"
Hawkins is one terrific story teller. She really knows how to build the suspense. Kept me guessing and wondering and turning the pages. I liked her writing style once I got used to her penchant for setting the mood of each scene. You keep wondering what the hell is going on here...and little by little she sucks you into the lives of these 5 people who are all connected. I really liked the device SHE used  switching first person accounts between the female protagonists. It was a great read even though the ending was anticlimactic...
"many if the reviews i've read commented on the 3 main characters having a similar voice and no real distinguishable factors. i didn't get that sense. However, i do feel that the book lacked some depth and the plot could have been more developed. i guess it wouk don't make for a good movie, though i'll probably never watch the motion picture."
"A rare treasure, written with verve and suspense, impossible to put down, and yet it needs perspective, standing back from it, contemplating the nuances, the self-absorption, the narcisistic nature of alcoholism.  Narcisists don't have to be beautiful, they don't necessarily revel in their self-esteem.  Quite the contrary, underneath it all they fear they are not beautiful and their self-esteem is absent or damaged, but they are absorbed in their own reflection, content, in fact surreptitiously delighted to subject those around them to their compulsions.  Yet Hawkins has turned it all into a mystery thriller.  Her recourse for the character's catharsis is chilling.  Are all women masochists?  And do they love the sociopath in compelling men?  This book is exceptional, far more than just a ""good read"", despite the occasional and very minor slips in syntax."
"'The Girl on the Train' is a refreshingly original, addictive thriller. Told from the perspective of three female characters, predominantly an ex-wife with voyeuristic and alcoholic tendencies.It's a mystery that unfolds in suburban London where commuter trains roll and stop along the sedentary backyards of houses that are filled with memories, marital bliss and conflicts. Houses with husbands and wives, nannies, babies and lies.Told with staggered timelines, a woman goes missing, one with a storied past. The husband is a suspect, or maybe it's her therapist, or could it be the lonely divorcee? Or maybe, it was the mysterious ginger-haired man on the train? Chapter after chapter, we're like rail commuters, rolling along the tracks, back and forth. With stops and starts, twists and turns.Memory lapses, jealousies, betrayals. It's quite a ride. 'Girl on a Train' captures it's characters emotions and thoughts flawlessly. A superb first novel by Paula Hawkins and is just the ticket for an engrossing, page-turning read - so good, you might miss your stop on the train commute home, or work."
"I can understand why this is a popular book.  As I am not a mystery novel fan, I found myself learning about the genre.  However, I did want to keep reading, even if some of the events were anticipated and probably necessary in a novel of this type.  I found Rachel's sections to be a bit drawn out and repetitive. As none of the male characters have a section where we hear their voices narrating, they immediately become suspects of the murder. About two thirds of the way through I figure out the killer.  The book could have been edited to make it about 100 pages shorter. Also, there are no sympathetic characters as most of them can't control their emotions, act in violent ways or indulge themselves and are in need of more therapy."
"Reading The Girl on the Train is like peeling an onion. The deeper you get into the story, the closer you get to understanding the central characters.  The main character, Rachel, is struggling on many levels. Half the time I was frustrated with her and the other half I wondered how and when she would regain her memory of that night when Megan disappeared and the part she might have played.  One of the most important elements of the plot is time. I would recommend that readers remember the key date, July 13, to keep from getting lost because Hawkins skillfully moves the plot in concentric circles around that date.  This is a page-turner. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"I bought this book, ""The Girl on the Train"" because I had heard that it was a great book, with lots of plot twists and turns.  I had heard that it was a similar type book to ""Gone Girl.""  It does have lots of plot twists.  It is similar in type to ""Gone Girl.""  It simply is not my kind of book.  I like mysteries -- and this book was definitely mysterious from beginning to end, but it was definitely too dark for me.  (So was ""Gone Girl, so I should have known better)  I don't want to give away the plot, but I will say this -- If you want a feel good book, this is definitely not the one for you.  I like to finish a book and feel better by the end.  I didn't see that happen here.  It was well written -- each chapter takes on the persona of one of the main characters, so you really do get to feel what they are feeling and doing.  It does bounce back and forth through time, but the chapter headings will let you know that."
"Everyone was talking about “The Girl on the train”. So I hopped on the bandwagon or should I say I hopped on the train too and bought the hard cover, not even the paperback. It seemed interesting about this girl who keeps admiring this couple she sees every day from her train window. It all fell flat…a psychological thriller it should be…I would psychological garbage…. The writer in my view is psychotic…..a lousy story with too much. She kept blacking out and can’t remember anything…too often…really makes no sense.I waste to buy the book and a waste of time on it…writer was just as drunk as Rachel in the story!"
"The first half of this book is very complicated, confusing, and rather slow to develop into a ""don't stop until you finish"" final.  I haven't had a chance to see the movie, but I know they won't be able to catch the different thought patterns of the main character.  Very detailed plot hard to follow at times; complicated, intertwined characters; dialogue (5 on a scale of 10.  It is a rather dreary read at times.SPOILER ALERT:  I have dealt with alcoholics in my past and it was painful to have the main character struggling so much with alcohol.  Several times I almost put it down because of the bad feelings it engendered."
"Although the style of writing from each character's point of view is something we have all seen before, this novel really allows this method to develop the characters.  The reader gets to see, from all angles, what is happening.  The plot keeps you guessing:  I must have changed my mind seven times in trying to figure out who was responsible.  You definitely can elate to our main character's perspective when on the train, in particular if you ever were or are currently a commuter.  You get involved with her thoughts and you realize that you may have done the same type of fantasizing in your travels.  A few twist, but not so many that you get lost.  A good, fast read."
"Hawkins has a good painterly sense of language, and the first part of the novel in particular is lullingly lyrical, exactly as it should be, pulling you into the book's deliberate confusion of reality and imagined reality. However, the plot doesn't hold up to this promise, and the revelations at the end about one particular character had me rolling my eyes. Yes, there are awful people in the world, selfish ones, puerile ones, and astoundingly shallow ones... but the Hannibal Lecter of this book suffers from real two-dimensionality, if not one-. None of the characters here are particularly admirable, frankly, which may be part of the point - the frailties of real folk versus their idealizations - but the result for me was less a sense of disturbance at how evil often wears an everyday face, and more a disappointment regarding how much more this book could have explored that truth. It's just too romanticized to really hit home the way a book like this has to, to have staying power. It never socks you in the gut the way it needs to, the way, for instance, that Girl with the Dragon Tattoo does repeatedly, until I had to put the book down for a bit and remind myself that people are just as often saints as monsters. It never, frankly, really sobers up. I'm sure some readers will violently disagree with me on that last point, but I just never got a sense of things becoming truly concrete in the jarring, almost dislocating way that one has when waking abruptly - or more appropriately, being smacked awake. This sort of tale requires a violent stripping away of the haze, a palpable jolt, a sudden, horrible realization that one has been pied-pipered into the river, has in fact been drowning for a while, and is now almost out of air. But my reaction to the ""big reveal"" was more ""Oh, for cripes sake, that's really it?""Granted, that was my reaction to the end of Da Vinci Code as well. Both that book and Girl on the Train have promising premises they don't deliver on. Our main character in this book is, tellingly, a *girl,* despite being a grown woman - and I'm not sure she's not still a girl at the end, or at least how much less of one she's really become."
"This book captured my attention immediately & kept it for almost all of the book. I had so many questions coupled with audible statements of ""this is crazy!"", which are both signs of a great thriller. However, about 3/4 of the way through, the end becomes so obvious that I found myself rolling my eyes repeatedly. The plot is excellent, but I was hoping for any version of the end except for the one that was written."
"The real shame is that Alfred Hitchcock is dead and therefore unable to film this book. It echoes some of his classics - you will find touches of ""Rear Window,"" ""Spellbound,"" and ""Suspicion,"" mixed with a heavy dollop of a famous non-Hitchcock work, ""Gaslight.""Other reviewers have given summaries, so I won't attempt to do it here; I would be too afraid to leave potential spoilers. All I can say to those idly picking it up is to stay with it: for quite a few pages I just wasn't, as they say, ""feeling it."" Suddenly it snapped on me like a mousetrap and I couldn't escape its grasp."
I Love to read but I found this novel depressing number one because the main character was an alcoholic an was always drinking. Number two because the entire book was sad. The ending although not predictable was again very depressing. I read for enjoyment and there was little enjoyment to this novel. If you like depressing books that are confusing (who was speaking at that time and date) then this book is for you. If you like a good book that keeps your interest but is not depressing then I strongly recommend that you not read this.
"This was a lot of build up for one single demented scene to wrap up all the loose ends. I was bored at times, and Rachel's drunken episodes made me not care much about her. I prefer to actually like the protagonist but this girl was desperate and sad. The 'mystery' was a bit over-worked and in the end, it was all sort of predictable."
"Hawkins creates a complex, believable character in Rachel who is flawed but not beyond redemption. As she weaves a fantasy to offset her failed life, she becomes caught up in a web of lies and half truths nourished by her alcoholism and desire for love. Finding herself in the middle of a missing person's investigation, Rachel seeks answers to questions hidden in a alcoholic blackout."
Not my style.  Didn't like it and I didn't finish it.  I got very tired of reading about how drunk she was over and over and over.  I think the book could have been half it's size if the repetitive thoughts of being drunk were left out.
"It seemed slow reading at first. But of course did have lots of twists and surprises. I kept trying to visualize it as I know there has been a movie made of it, but that was difficult. The main character, Rachel, seemed too self-absorbed and dull to me. I kind of felt like she was whining all the time ""poor me"". I kept wanting her to get her act together, which she did at the end."
"Wow. Get this book, and don't put it down until you are done. Silence your phone. Get a babysitter. Order pizza. Do whatever you need to do to tear through this book without interruption. Memento meets Gone Girl. The narrators and the time periods change, but you will be so hooked you'll need a scorecard to find out whodunit and why. But you won't care! You'll do what we did, drooling and hanging on every page till the very satisfying end."
I really wanted to like this book as it has so many fantastic reviews and has just been made into a movie. But as I sit here having just finished it I don't feel connected to the characters in anyway and am actually rather annoyed at how it ended. I found the book extremely predictable and all the female characters were weak while the male characters were all abusive.. Not really my cup of tea
"I'm sorry but I actually wish that this author had never written this story. It was crazy, you can't keep up with every twist and turn. I honestly hope that this author never writes another story."
"it was an okay read for me. I figured out who did it before I was halfway through the book and that completely ruined it for me. I don't regret buying it but all the hype was just that... hype! If you are an avid mystery reader, it won't hold up. I say read it anyway and make up your own mind. I won't read it again."
At first I found the book a bit difficult to follow because it jumped from character to character and dates kept changing with the change of characters. I quickly realized I had to pay attention to which character and what the date was when going to a new chapter.  But I found the book intriguing from the first page. I couldn't put it down. Well written - - a great mystery.
"Read it in 4 hours one night (couldn't put it down!) but should have waited for day time because I was really scared after finishing it! Haha. Fun book. Figured out who it was around page 200 (out of 326) when a vital clue is given, but still was fun reading to put together all the pieces of why that made sense, and didn't resolve until the last couple pages. Very fun book."
"A little on the dark side, but read it in two days! Can be a little tough to follow the dates at times as it jumps back and forth (found myself flipping around quite a bit to figure out where I was). Overall, very entertaining read. Purchased another copy as a gift for a mystery-loving family member! Heard it is similar to Gone Girl, but heard others liked Gone Girl better."
"This book was okay - entertaining enough. I found that it was pretty predictable earlier than I feel it should have been. Plus, none of the characters were very likable, so I wasn't very invested in the storyline. It was just OK."
Slow to start. It picks up the pace and captivates the reader around 2/3 of the way into the story.Did initially find it hard to follow the three different people's accounts but it eventually all made sense
"We chose to read this for our book club, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. On one hand, it brought me back to a time when people took the time to relax, riding a train for everyday travel. The author sucked me in right away with her description of characters and events, enabling me to feel as though I were actually there. The emotions were real, and twists in the story felt normal, not contrived. As I rode the train into NYC one day, I channelled the protagonist, and watched as houses flew by, and thinking what stories they may contain."
"Enjoyed the different perspectives, as the author switched from Rachel, to Anna, to Megan, in viewing how difficult life can be for people with significant personal problems, particularly attachment issues, arising from early childhood traumas.  Good exploration of the role of excessive alcohol consumption as a 'mind altering drug,' designed to avoid dealing with reality, and yet perpetuating continued dysfunction and unrealistic fantasizing.  Surprisingly realistic and uncomfortable portrayal of people's search for love in all the wrong places."
"Once you figure out who the different characters are, the book is highly engrossing. In the beginning, the female characters blend together and it is hard to keep them straight, but finally the ""girl on the train"" emerges as the strongest character and the other ladies are easier to figure out. The writer develops Rachel throughout the book and goes into various facets of her personality. She is both suspicious and then likeable, finally sympathetic to the reader. Overall, it's an excellent, finely crafted book. I wish I could write this well."
"Sometimes  I like to get out of  my  comfort  zone and read a novel  that I  usually  wouldn't  have  read. Well this  is  one  of  those  books. Not easy to like the cast of  characters  and not  easy  to  keep  up with a storyline  with so many  people.But if you  take  the  time  and  effort  you will be glad you  did. The author  did a great  job  of  developing  her main character. And while  I at times didn't  like her, she stayed  interesting  though  the  entire  book.  I am  so  glad  I took  the  time  to  add this  book to my read list."
I couldn't put this book down! I loved this book! What a page-turner! I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves suspense and psychological thrillers.
"Loved this book, even though the main character is pretty messed up. She's an alcoholic trying to deal with a divorce and the loss of her job. Now she is riding the train everyday to a job she no longer has, passing her old home in which her ex and his new wife and baby live. To make matters worse she has begun to fantasize about the young couple two doors down. Things really get tangled when the wife of the young couple disappears. 's. Hawkins keeps you guessing till the end about how all these people connect."
"I wanted to read this book as there is a lot of buzz about it at the moment. It wasn't what i was expecting, hard to get into it at the start, flitting from one person to the next but it was a good read, though I had worked out the ending about half way in but that didnt distract really from it. I don't know is it worthy of all the hype though, I read alot of books and found it no better than most that I read.  Now if i paid for it in the shops I would be disappointed but having only paid a fraction of the cost on the kindle, I was pleased that I waited to read it on the kindle."
"I really enjoyed reading this book. You have to pay attention to the dates and/ or character changes of each chapter  but the changes caused me to stay focused on every detail. It is well written and  very descriptive. I felt as though I knew each character personally. I saw the newly released movie a few days after Finishing the book.  Movie is very good, too, and makes only a few changes."
"Very entertaining, far more sensible and better written than Gone Girl. Without spoiling the story, it may frustrate you to deal with one character in particular, but do not give up.  It was a fun story and I enjoyed the read and could not put it down."
"I've heard such good reviews about this book but it's torture to force myself to get through it just so I can say ""I've read this book"".  I want to like it but I'm feeling a bit ""meh"" about it.  Over and over again about the main character's drunken antics.  Please.... just get me to the end.  I'm hopeful I may someday finish it, but for now, this is my opinion.  And I'm pretty sure I know how it's going to end."
"I enjoyed the book but was very confused in the beginning due to the trying to keep the characters straight.  The main character rode the train daily but she had named the people that she saw and as the story progressed you learn the real names of the characters and it was just hard for me to keep up as I read in spurts.  The story was good with it's twists and turns and it took me awhile to figure out the villian, but I would recommend the book however I would recommend that you try to read it straight through and not in the spurts as I did as I did have the characters confused for a while."
"I've read Gone Girl and now The Girl on the Train.  I never understood why Gone Girl got such great reviews as it was poorly written and not the least bit original.  Paula Hawkins got it right.  This was an enjoyable read and one of the few ""chick"" books I've ever read that I enjoyed.  I did find the book a bit confusing at first because of the changing both of the characters and the year that events occurred.  Other than that, a fun read all the way,"
"Overall, I enjoyed reading this novel, but I'm not sure I understand the overwhelmingly excellent reviews.  This book is nothing  close to Gone Girl, and shouldn't be compared to Flynn.  I wanted to know how it ended and I was compelled to keep reading to find out. As a debut novel, I am definitely still interested in seeing what comes next.Unfortunately, there is room for improvement. In my opinion, there wasn't a lot of character development, which may have been by design as part of the mystery. but in the end, I didn't really care what happened to the characters"
"As always, an unreliable narrator appeals tremendously and our Rachel as the Girl on the Train is not only unreliable but heartbreakingly damaged as well.  The story unfolds with multiple points of view that rarely match up, which also adds complexity.  I found the characters authentically developed, and although no one comes off as someone with whom you'd like to have dinner, I still cared enough for them to turn the page every time.As a suspense novel, this is anything but cookie cutter."
"I would give it only 3 stars except it had a nice ""Hitchcock-ian"" ending which alone got it star #4. However, it was really hard to follow due to the author jumping back and forth to different time periods in the characters lives. I got a third of the way through and had to go back to the start and make a chart showing the name or pseudonym of each character and their relationship with the other characters (and a few notes on their flaws) just to keep everything straight. I recommend you stay  with the book to the end because as I say the ending is worth the trip."
Took a while to get into. Had a hard time identifying with the main character and got the 3 voices confused at first. But by the middle of the book i was hooked and found the conclusion satisfying. Would recommend it to my book club.
"I thought it was a page turner.  I loved the twists and turns of the story.  It was innocent,  and I was surprised at the  comrades the ladies  became  to save themselves.  I'm glad I read the book before seeing the movie.  This allows you to no the characters in depth."
"So that was a great read. I felt bad for Rachel with what she went through about not being able to have a baby and understand why she got out of control with the drinking. But man did I cringe every time she drank. I wanted to reach through the pages and shake her. I figured out who the killer was halfway through but it was still exciting to get to the part when it was revealed. Man, I didn't particularly like any of the characters in the book. They all had major issues lol. Lastly I'll just say I wish Rachel would have been pregnant at the end. I thought after every thing that happened that would have been a nice surprise for her. I bet I'm not the only one."
"First half of the book was slow moving. The main character, Rachel, seems to either always be drunk or thinking about getting drunk. I din not enjoy this. However, it did pick up a bit in the last third of the book but the basic story did not seem realistic."
"Expected so much more. Good reading buddies said they couldn't put it down so I had to read it. What a total waste of time.  The characters are absurd, the twists are predictable, the writing is average.  Not sure what everyone else saw in this book."
"Alcoholics, sociopaths, narcissists, psychopaths, pseudo psychologist. The supply of hopeless and helpless people never runs out.One of the least entertaining and most irritating books I have read since Eat, Pray, Love or Gone Girl...all the same genre."
"I had been hearing about this one for a long time and then I heard they were making a movie. So I decided it was time to buy it and read it. I devoured this book in a few short days. I loved how the story was from a few different points of view, so we could get inside the head of these characters. The story focuses on Rachel, the girl on the train. She takes the same route each day and there is a couple she sees as she is riding by, but one day something is different. I loved this story and I loved how Paula made you think about it and made you think it was everyone. This was a great psychological thriller, highly recommended!"
"Interesting book that puts you in the mind of Gone Girl, but this book is not as well written. Even though I pretty much read it in one sitting, it bogged down about 40% in - I couldn't see where it was going which you would think is a good thing, but there was just too much drunk Rachel.  I got kinda tired of reading it, but I rarely start a book and not finish it.  Besides, it picked back up after a major discovery and that made it easier to finish.  I read this because my sister read it first and wanted me to as well before we see the movie.  It's likely this will be one of the few movies that are better than the book it's based on.  3.5 stars"
"I tried three different times to get into this book and I found it tedious with a boring plot.  In addition, it takes place in England and I really steer clear of book happening in some place besides the United States.  I would not recommend this book."
No distractions when reading this! Especially in the very begi ning learning all each of the charactors! Good luck Rachel
"I really loved how the narrator changed throughout the book, it took me awhile to really get into the story but once I did it was the kind of book you can't wait to get home and pick up again.  The author did a great job NOT doing a lot of foreshadowing so the ending came as somewhat of a surprise and that made it more fun to make my own predictions along the way.Don't expect this to read as well as a Gillian Flynn thriller, it took awhile for the story to really get rolling.  Definitely a good read, but compared to other books I've read in the same genre recently I gave it 4 stars."
"I will say this book has a nice twist at the end, but I almost didn't finish the book. I've never read a book where NOT ONE single character is likeable. The story has five main characters: Rachel, Anna, Tom, Megan, and Scott.  Megan goes missing...but honestly, if all five went missing at the same time, that would have made the book more bearable. I could not sympathize with any characters and hoped they would all perish somewhere in the story. I will say Paula Hawkins at least makes the book worth finishing with a good ending."
"Looking forward to seeing the movie and doing a comparison.  While it goes back and forth in time (before, during and after the crime), it was not confusing to follow the time line.  I only gave it 4 stars because I figured out who ""dunnit"" about half way through, but still enjoyed how the author worked it out.  The narrator was also very good, subtly changing her voice for different characters."
"I thought that this book was ok.  You knew enough information about the characters to feel like you 'understand' them but not enough to feel like you 'know' them.  The plot of the story was good, however, I feel like if this were to be made into a movie it would go directly to Lifetime.  It just didn't have enough depth for me.  It was worth the read but I won't be recommending it to anyone I know.  I would have given it 4 stars if it wasn't for the rave reviews...I think they set my hopes too high for this book."
I bought this book about 6 months ago but had not gotten around to reading it until now.  I absolutely loved it!  This ranks as one of my favorite reads for this year.  It only took me two days to read it as I was hooked from the beginning.  I loved the twists and turns of the plot and was really surprised at the ending.  Now I know why this has been on the best seller list for so long.
"While the plot is fantastic and engaging, I genuinely enjoyed this book for the very strange reason that I didn’t feel compelled to love (or even like) the characters. Their flaws can be maddening, but it drew me into the story as a whole as opposed to siding with a single character as we so often do. I can’t remember the last time I felt genuine frustration with a character (as opposed to the plot or writing) like I did while reading this, but it made it hard to put down. It’s truly amazing storytelling that we don’t get enough of these days!"
"This was a mesmerizing read. Each plot twist and development compelled me to read more of the book. The story conjured echoes of Gillian Flynn's ""Gone Girl,"" but they are distinctly different works. Rachel is a confounding narrator, and equally infuriating character. Her personal flaws and repeated misinterpretations of other characters' intentions are key to the novel. If you can't accept Rachel, you probably won't enjoy the story. The chapters told from the other characters' perspectives enriched the storytelling and mystery. An entertaining, escapist read."
"Rachel Watson lives a sad life. Her marriage fell apart, she drinks, and fantasized about a ""perfect couple"" she sees on her train ride. But this couple is not perfect as she thought. If you love, Gone Girl, you will enjoy the twist in this book."
I really enjoyed the book. I also liked how it was done in a diary dorm through the three main women of the book. Really enjoyed reading it and was not thrown by who done it all at the end of the book. Cant wait to see how the movie goes off this
"I cannot imagine why this has been #1 on the best-seller list because it was quite sophomoric!  I finished it because that is my habit, but then I wondered why did I waste my time with undeveloped characters, and very pure descriptions throughout.  Sorry."
"Well, I read this book in two days, and was sad when I finished.  Not what I expected, but better.  The characters are well developed, but with lots of unexpected twists.  Just when you think you've got a handle on things, you realize you don't!  Not a book to pick up if you don't have time to really jump into it.  The movie is coming out soon, and I'm not sure how I feel about seeing it.  Usually, if its a really good book, I am typically disappointed by the film.  I think I'll see it, though,  just because I enjoyed the plot so much, and Emily Blunt is in it.  I am going to be looking forward to Paula Hawkins next book for sure!  GREAT read!"
"I wish I hadn't wasted my time finishing this book in the hope that it would wow me as it did those who recommended it. It is about three women, all self absorbed, jealous, irresponsible, obsessive and addictive. They all have tiny lives and they all are alone and lonely, living out fantasies of being saved or betrayed by one or another imaginary knight in shining armor. The original setting of a woman on a train observing and then imagining the lives of people she passes is abandoned. The actual setting is in the minds of the female characters expressed in first person narratives. There is virtually no character development here, but plenty of sex (much extramarital), harrowing descriptions of alcoholic misadventure, real and imagined violence. One  suspects that the author may be rather fantastic and unlovely herself. She certainly doesn't like men. Two stars instead of one only because it is fairly well-written."
"Good read, it was difficult to put down. The early part of the book was mostly informational, introducing and defining the 3 main characters. I thought  all 3 were similar in some aspects and had to go back and recall which character I was reading about. This by no means took away from the enjoyment. As I continued to read, the characters became more defined and I could see them as different individuals with some similarities. The longer I read, the harder it became to put down.  Wasn't expecting the ending, but then, isn't that the point of being a good writer!  I am lookig forward to seeing the movie based on this book, it should be intereting!"
"Don't be lulled into a false sense of security. Like the slow click of roller coaster wheels climbing up their first steep incline, this book starts slowly, lost in the mind of one woman whose tragic life is submerged in the blurring haze of alcohol where fantasy becomes easily confused with reality and self-pity comes as easily and frequently as fear and doubt. Then, just when the reader is beginning to feel this book might be moving just a little too slow to be worth finishing, the coaster reaches its peak. What follows is a hurtling descent full of twists and turns that will leave you gripping, white knuckled, into the wee hours of the morning."
"I am not going to bother to run a synopsis of the book, you can already see that in the description in the listing.  I am so enjoying this book and I am only through the first 80 pages or so.  I am actually reading a bit at a time because I want it to last, LOL  The characters as well as, the plot-line, are very well written.  I was drawn into the story and involved by the first few pages.  For me, that is the hallmark of a very, very good read.You become the characters, you live their lives, feel for them, dislike them, and cheer then on.  Also, as a Brit, the authors  description of all things British are spot on!"
"I actually bought this book back last year. I tried to read it a couple of times but just couldn't get into it. Well now that they've made a movie out of it I figured I needed to try again. So, I plunged in. I've read other books like this one where it's really a slow moving book, they just don't keep my attention. I'm giving it three stars just because others must have seen something good in it in order to make a movie from it. Even though I finished it I'm sorry but I just wouldn't recommend reading it. I know there are others that I'm sure loved it, but I love murder mysteries and this one is just too slow moving for me."
"The beginning of this book was very slow and even towards the end it wasn't very exciting. When the book finally climaxed, it was good however I feel as though it wasn't good enough. The very ending of the book for Rachel was disappointing; during the climax of the books she became so strong but the ending described her as essentially the same person before a tragic situation - the only difference her being 20 days sober.. the previews for the movie over the novel and the description about the book really lead me to believe this book would be very exciting which sadly it didn't meet expectations..."
Being strapped to a chair for hours and forced to watch abandoned and abused puppies staring sadly out of cages while Sara MacLaughlin sings Arms of The Angel would be a cheerful experience by comparison.  But the twists and turns made for a good read.
"I started this book quite a while ago and put it down bc the many characters' narratives were confusing and I got tired of trying to keep them straight. When the movie was announced I decided to give it another try. Once I decided to pay more careful attention to the change in voices and got to know the characters better, I got sucked in so strongly that I couldn't put it down! Another family member had the same experience! Now I'm delighted I gave it a second chance. I must admit to have guessed at the culprit about half way through, but the way that was revealed was terrific. And now I can't wait to see what they do to the story in the movie."
"I was sooo excited to read this book after all of the great things I heard about it.  It took me a couple of tries before I was in the right frame of mind to read it.  For me, there was too much of the book wrapped up in how drunk and miserable she was.  This part got old fast and made the story drag on.  I guessed who the villain was way before the end of the book.  I think I would have liked it more if the main character, Rachel, would have made more attempts to improve herself throughout the story, even as she was embroiled in her obsession.  Her pathetic nature just kind of overshadowed the whole book for me."
"The Girl On The Train was an easy Summer read, easily finished in a couple of days. None of the characters in the book are likable people, but that lends more to the story than detracts from it, or it could have if the author had provided a little more character development for a couple of the characters. The main character, Rachel, is a divorced alcoholic who wastes her time daydreaming about the lives of strangers while in denial of what a mess her own life has become. Her ex-husband has moved on with a new wife and has a child, but she is in denial about her place in his life. She spends her days riding a train from her flat to London, and each day, she passes by their house -- her former house. When she interjects herself into the lives of strangers, she ends up embroiled in a missing persons case. Because she drinks too much and lies too much, her sincere desire to help comes across as attention-seeking and unstable. Her constant lies hurt the victims and only make her look more insane. When she starts telling the truth, nobody believes anything she says. The ending was somewhat contrived, but there had to be an ending, and better this one than one of the alternatives, I guess. The reasoning behind the perpetrator's actions were hidden from the reader for too long. Everything that could have been discussed throughout the book was shoved into the last few pages. By the end, I was satisfied and enjoyed it, but it could have been tweaked for a bit more suspense."
"The book has a strong plot. If you like mysteries, I recommend it. It moves along at a steady pace and has an interesting style: It is written from the point of view of primarily three women, mostly two. Early on the voices of these women were quite different, but as the book progressed it got harder and harder to distinguish them, which might have been intentional. I didn't know ""who did it"" until it was revealed, so kudos to the author for that. My main complaint is that I didn't find any of the characters likeable, but that might be less of an issue in the movie (I love Emily Blunt)."
"""The Girl on the Train"" definitely had it's ups and downs. The main character - an alcoholic spending half the book in a drunken stupor - was infuriating, frustrating, and downright depressing. There were times where I felt truly sad for her, and others where I rolled my eyes at her terrible decision making. There are only a few characters in this novel at all, and none of them are likable. The plot had a lot of promise, though the end was more of an over-dramatized Lifetime movie and less ""Gone Girl"". It was a fun read, but nothing that shines in terms of mind-blowing twists and turns or characterization."
"This Girl on the Train was a bit confusing at first because the story is being told through the eyes of three different characters: Rachel, Megan and Anna so the story seemed disorganized at first. The author, however, has a nice way of bringing the story together making the views of each character correlate with one-another. The plot was also really good and the ending intriguing right up until the very end! All in all, I definitely recommend this book!"
"While deciding whether I should purchase this book or not I came very close to giving it pass mainly due to the fact that I was seeing a large number of people giving the book a bad rating, citing reasons such as the fact that the characters are unlikable and the story line dull. I couldn't be happier that I decided to give it a go!!The characters are in my opinion what makes this book great, the book revolves mainly around the lives of Megan, Rachel and Anna, all of them being a special kind of messed up and definitely not the type of people that you would like to have in your life. While theses characters might not be your run of the mill ""good guy"", ""bad guy"" (or girl in this instance) together with a person that gets thrown into the mix to be a bit of a diversion, they feel real, we all have problems and secrets and some of us handle or suppress it better than others. The story line evolves quick enough to ensure that you are not bored for a single moment and while it lets slip a few clues which suggest what is actually going on you can never be certain until the end when things unravel fairly rapidly and even though you might have figured one or two things out along the way there will be a surprise or two waiting for you, albeit dark ones.I haven't read ""Gone Girl"" so I can unfortunately not draw that analogy but what I can tell you is that this is a spectacular read that will keep you tapping your kindle's screen without the slightest feeling of duress."
"This book  had me enthralled from the start , the ""heroine"" of the book evoked feelings of sympathy as she stumbled through her life , a victim of a cruel  heartbreak  which leaves her as a pitiful victim , though it is easy to understand her despair and feel for her as she weaves her fantasy to distract and escape from the hopelessness and unfairness  of her situation .  This is a compelling thriller and I really couldn't put it down. Was the conclusion as twisted and clever as I would have hoped? I can't say it left me with a big ""wow"" factor as I would have liked but still a satisfying conclusion. I like the way the 3 female characters were involved in the storytelling and like all good books I became emotionaly involved in some way with each character .  Defiantly a good read I recommend it."
"Let me start by saying I did not like this book at all, but I did not like Gone Girl, either.  It may be I just don't like these types of psychological thrillers.  The characters in this book are so far-fetched, it's hard to believe they would really exist.  The women seem unable to run their own lives and the men have violent tendencies.  The book is a classic whodunnit and I kept reading because I wanted to see how the author wrapped it up even though I figured it out earlier in the book.  Also, I found it difficult to distinguish between Rachel, Megan and Anna as the story bounced back and forth from their perspectives.  The author gave them all the same 'voice' since her writing style was the same between all three characters.  I often had to go back to the beginning of a chapter to see who was narrating that particular chapter.  At times, the book dragged and the ending was ridiculous.  I don't understand the hype about this book, think I'll stick to historical fiction!"
"Girl named Anna – she’s a bit messed up. Girl named Megan – she’s a bit messed up. Girl named Rachel – she’s a bit messed up. Rachel likes to ride trains. One day she sees SOMETHING, and nothing is ever the same.To be honest, this book was a bit of a letdown. All the hype. All the intrigue. It just fell a little bit flat, and left me feeling deflated at the end. I thought there would be MORE.This story is told in alternating perspectives from three different women: Rachel, Anna, and Megan, each with their own set of unique baggage. I disliked them all so much, I can’t decide who I like the least – but this was an I-enjoy-not-liking-you dislike, if that makes sense. However, none of them really roused much empathy from me, and I only developed surface level feelings. Frankly, I just didn’t really care all that much about any them.Don’t get me wrong, it was good enough, and certainly held my interest. I read it pretty quickly, and definitely was invested in the story. The alternating perspectives, and the way it jumped around in time, though commonplace in books these days, was, for the most part, successful here. The writing was simple, and clipped along at a decent pace to grab and maintain my attention.All in all, I would say read it, but it’s a case of been-there-done-that for me. It obviously works for some people though, given it’s reigning status at the top of the bestsellers list. I also think it would make a great book club pick, as it’s short, quick, and full of plenty of chat-able fodder.For more, visit www.bookishtendencies.com"
"This well-written, alternatiing character novel was slow to grab me, but I read on 'cause everyone I know seemed to love this book. I read on and was glad I had, but it gave me no great pleasure or intellectual take-away."
"I started this book only because friends told me it was good.  At first, I didn't believe what they were telling me but I kept reading. This book is so well written that after a short time I could not have stopped.  The mystery is woven into twisted that kept me reading. I needed to know what happens to Megan, and Rachel.  It has 5 stars from me plus if you haven't read it, I suggest you do."
"I think I'm one of the few who wasn't impressed. To have each chapter told from someone else's POV, each character needs to have a different ""voice"". All of the females in this story sound the same. You really had to make sure you knew exactly who's mind you were in at all time or you will be confused. Also, all of the characters had very generic names that made it very hard to distinguish who was who.With such great reviews and having not heard one bad thing, I was disappointed. Good intriguing story but generic characters."
"An amazing novel by Paula Hawkins. I couldn't put the book down. This was a definitely a fast read, was done in a couple of days.  I loved the different perspectives of the characters and how perceptions truly changed throughout the book. There were moments when I felt unease near the end and the ending completely threw me off (in a good way). I actually wished the book kept going on as I got really attached to the main character. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves suspense."
I like all the depth of the characters right off the bat. It was fun to constantly have your mind working thinking you had it figured out only to have another twist thrown at you. You fall in love with the very unlovable main character Rachel. Just such a well-written book I can't wait to read more by this author... and of course see the new blockbuster movie of the girl on the train!!!
"Over 20,000 people can't be wrong. Check out the sample, you'd end up buying the book. I needed a change in the category of novels I had been selecting and this was it. Suspenseful, a smidge dark, with pieces of surprises here and there. The plot and the characters are like something I have not experienced before. If you identify with the main character(s), the book is that much better. No story is perfect, with the exception of a few exceptional pieces, but I'm rating this a 5-star because this one make me want to pick up another suspenseful novel."
"The girl going to work on a commuter train into London every morning develops idyllic fantasies from fleeting glimpses made possible by a caution signal that often slows or even stops the train, giving her a glimpse of the back yards of a neighborhood in which she once lived.  Events in that neighborhood begin the illumination of the private lives of all involved, and includes a growing circle of people which quickly swirls into a vortex of intrigue that brings out their dark sides.  This novel starts at a leisurely pace but continually accelerates until everything breaks."
"Paula Hawkins has constructed a well – written, well-organized story that is told through three different first person narrators. This strategy of story telling – first Rachel, now Megan, now Anna, now Rachel, with soliloquy’s by Megan told after her disappearance, constantly reminds us that we cannot trust anyone. Memory and imagination can be manipulated, and people and events are open to interpretation. The Girl on the Train is a lesson in character study, and executed brilliantly at that...Read more at http://ilovemymani.com/2015/03/06/tan-lime-the-girl-on-the-train-book-review/"
"The Girl on the Train, by Paula Hawkins, has been on the best seller lists for more than a year now, and I understand why. I’m not a fan of first person present tense narration, and there are three such narrators in the book, all of them undependable. The characters spend the entire book lying, cheating, and fantasizing. Terrible secrets are revealed and hearts are broken. This is not a feel-good book. But it is fascinating and difficult to put down, and I recommend it."
I wanted more. I was able to figure out what was happening too early. I thought the book was over hyped. Not a bad read but I guess I wanted something with more depth and hooks. I get annoyed at books that jump from character and different points in time. There are better ways to build suspense and plot. Almost seems like a way to avoid writing a deeper and suspenseful novel. Just jump from character to character at random points in time to confuse the reader. I guess I better start working on my great American novel.
"This was an interesting read told from he perspectives of three women. One, the protagonist, is a depressed alcoholic who watches people from her seat on the train and makes up her own observations of their lives. The other two women are the ones that the Girl on the train observe each day. They are all connected, as the story unfolds, and we are taken through their daily lives to discover something terrible has happened to one women. The girl on the train immerses herself into the situation to a point of risking her own life.An enjoyable read for mystery lovers."
At first it threw me off when the author would switch the character who was telling the story from time to time but I quickly came to like this change of perspective. I began this book without having read much about it and I'm very much the type of person who will read the first few pages and either decide it's a book I'll like or move on to something else and it didn't take long to decide that I would enjoy this novel. A great page turner and some jaw dropping moments. I would recommend this book for sure :)
"I know this is billed as a psychological thriller.  I cannot understand its maintenance at number one on the best sellers list.  I found the first two thirds of the book slow, boring with totally unappealing women characters.  It was not until the last third of the book that it picked up in solving the murder, even if the characters, now including the men, were still ridiculous, unsympathetic and the murderer became clear way before the ending.  I only stuck it out because people I know told me how wonderful the book was.  Won't take their reading recommendations any more."
"This book was pretty predictable, and honestly, I didn't really get the point of the confrontation between the husband of the woman and Rachel.  It never seemed like we got a resolution as to why he was so angry with her to the point of trapping her.  The ending was pretty blah, and I feel like this was just a great value brand of Gone Girl, which was pretty popular."
"Told in the first person from the perspective of the three primary female characters, this story alternates along the timeline between present and past, depending on which character is speaking.  You'll love, be frustrated by, be disappointed in, be confused by, and eventually understand Rachel.  An unforgettable character. This is a compelling story -- you won't be able to put it down!."
"Fun read - it really kept my attention and pulled me into the story and had me wanting to know the characters. I liked that the story wasn't happening in a linear fashion... but sometimes I did have to look back at the chapter heading and see ""when"" something was happening. I read it on a Kindle, so it was a bit cumbersome going back and forth (the chapters are named ""Rachel"", ""Megan"" and ""Anna"" - over and over again, so it's easy to lose your place). I'm looking forward to a movie using this story!"
"The beginning of this book was tiring for me and the main character was disgusting. This was a book club read and my recommendation so I trudged along.  The one thing that was very clear early on was the author's ability to make you feel as though the events were happening to you; I think that's why it was so difficult at first.  However, this is one of the best fiction novels I've ever read.  I will attempt to find other books she has written."
"Well built story. Kept me turning pages. I could tell immediately that this one would be made into a movie. Great characters with a storyline that is suspenseful. I admit there were times I wanted to slap Rachel but perhaps it was because she reminded of alcoholics I know who cannot be helped and behave in a similar fashion. I did begin putting the pieces together myself by the end, but it was fun to see how it would all unravel."
"I enjoyed the stylistic choice to switch between three points-of-view to tell this twisting tale (reminiscent of Gone Girl with all of its surprises); however, I wish that any of the characters had been truly likable. I didn't feel connected to any of them so much that I cared deeply about them, and that is the reason I only gave this four, not five, stars. It was a very enjoyable and compelling read, despite my personal lack of connection to the characters. I also found the literary conceit of narration through a train window very entertaining and unique."
"I give it 3 stars ONLY  because it was well written. This lady can write! But it fell flat to me Rachel got on my last nerves being a stupid, weak drunk. I guessed ""WHODONEIT"" but finished  it to see if I  was right and I was. I found it predictable and not very suspenseful. This book came highly recommended to me and I had high expectations, but I feel like I got it on with a two minute brother."
Great book that kept me guessing! Each time I thought I knew what happened to the missing girl they threw something in to change my mind! Near the end I figured it out but still a great time reading this. Was often hard to put down!
"I was looking forward to this book, highly recommended.  I found the women to be portrayed as weak, crazy and lusting for men who were obnoxious and controlling. Even the therapist was of poor character.  The storyline picked up near the end, but wasn't enough to compensate for the stereotypical roles."
"A cleverly constructed story written from the perspectives of the three main female characters, Rachael, Megan, and Anna.  Rather than numerical chapters, each chapter is named for whomever happens to be telling the story from their point of view at the time.  This transforms into a gripping and exciting yarn about love found, then tragically lost.  It touches upon the insidious and hopeless consequences of alcoholism, infidelity, and ultimately cold and calculated murder.  This is not a happy story with a fairytale ending.  It left me feeling glad it was over but satisfied I stayed with it."
I simply found it uninteresting although the idea of having the story revolve around a girl's observations over time as she views things out her train window was innovative. The book was just not for me.
I tried to love this book. I wanted to. The Characters were unlikeable and messy and frankly halfway through the book I stopped reading for months. The ending picked up and there were some definite turns and twists but I can easily say there are better choices for this type of Hitchcock wanna be read.
"This book is convoluted and extremely difficult to follow since it constantly changes point of view. Also, it is poorly edited allowing glaring sentence structure errors, such as fragments. i cannot recommend it either since it is really very trashy.."
"I read when I go to bed and this one put me right out.  The book starts very slowly, but I kept reading trying to understand how riding back and forth on a train could develop into a story.  Very dark characters that are difficult to identify with.  I finished it, but was less than satisfied."
just finished reading the book and I found it to be one of my favorite reads.  I totally recommend it to others that enjoy a suspenseful dark character based novel.  It had a great finish but I was sorry it all had to come to an end.
"Buzz from my peers said this book was a hot ticket, and had a surprise ending that would leave you shocked.Well, it may have been hot at one time, but the so-called surprise ending was flat. In retrospect, there were many misdirections and red herrings littering the tale. Story lines never fully developed and introduced characters left dangling. The different narratives from the women was at first interesting, but later grew tedious, as they kept doing, saying, thinking the same things.The male characters were almost indistinguishable except for the exotic doctor. Another red herring. Like the red-haired guy on the train.SPOILER ALERT! Do not read on if you've not read the book:There are 5 main characters and one of them was the murderer. No shock there. What's shocking about that? I mean, shocking would have been that all three women turned out to be the same person? With the way the dates jumped around, it could have been possible. Or perhaps Megan never died--It was not her body. She was just starting life over somewhere else? Or perhaps the baby, Evie, would be the killer? THAT would've been shocking! But not the dull ending, where a drunk lady starts to remember stuff. Ho hum. Tremendously long-winded build-up to a klutzy, quick finish.Not worth the hype."
"Too much hype. I really expected more. Modern day women allowing themselves to be abused by men. Sorry, I don't see how this book received any good reviews. It was difficult to finish and a disappointing ending."
"A slog of a read.  I stuck with it to the very end, but it's only really gripping in the last 2% (I read on Kindle).  The timeline can be ignored--it adds nothing but confusion and helps the reader not in the least.  The writing is pedestrian.  The characters not sharply delineated, they tend to blend into each other.  And enough with the booze motive.  It got it right away, and the author just belabors the same stuff over and over.  Probably better off if you pay the money for the movie.  The cost would be similar, it will take less of your time, plus you can have popcorn.  Not recommended."
"An intriguing story line but a struggle to get through. I enjoy reading stream of consciousness, first person narrative but, not when every character is like that. Three women, three men all taking about her, she, me, we, us, he, him...skipping forward and backward in time with no point of reference other than a woman's name and a date at the beginning of a chapter. I found myself having to flip back to the beginning of a chapter to figure out who was talking and when things were happening. Read when rested, focused and with no distractions or interruptions."
"Very well written, I loved it!  Suspenseful! I love to predict how a book is going to end, but with this one, I couldn't until near the end, which makes it a very interesting read for me!!! I love novels set in England, where I have never been and I love drawing contrasts to the life in the USA! Anyway, a great read and can't wait for the movie!!!  Give me another great book like this! Kuddos to Paula Hawkins!!!"
"After reading the plot synopsis, I was excited at first to read The Girl on the Train. Once I started though, it seemed as if I read the same descriptions and the same dialogue over and over again. I get that it's called what it is and the protagonist does spend an inordinate amount of time not only on the train, but also rehashing, in an interior monologue, situations that she has experienced time and time and time again. I finished it but the ending was not only predictable but a disappointment."
"I thought the book was good but not gripping. I didn't particularly care for any of the characters, so maybe that's why I didn't particularly care what happened to them. I just don't understand people who don't have drive to go out and do anything, but then complain about being bored and feeling like they have no purpose... no sympathy. But the end was interesting."
A real page turner.  You root for her and then you aren't sure you should. I recommend this on for sure.
"Decent storyline, plain language and no foreshadowing or symbolism incorporated to make the story richer.  It was like listening to your friend talk about her friends.  The descriptions of the places and characters were short and unimaginative.  I read this after a Stephen King novel and it was like going from watching a cinematic masterpiece to a reality tv show.  It was okay to pass time but not a book I'll be recommending.  The characters lacked depth and conviction -- again like listening to your friend recount gossip."
This was similar to many books I've read which start out well-written and captivating and which lose momentum about halfway through.  I had to force myself to finish it.
Scary book; liked it; kept you on the edge...a bit difficult to follow
"The novel is based mainly in Rachel, a commuter on London's rail line. As she travels passed the home she once shared with her husband, she can't help but wonder about the residents she sees outside their homes, and how her lonely life and vivid imagination add to the evil that occurs at 15 and 23 Blenheim Street."
"I found the switching of the narration between the three main female characters to be confusing, especially as the time was not consistent I kept having to refer back to previous chapters to get time context. About one-third to half-way through I struggled to be bothered to finish the book. In the end I did persevere, if only to find whodunit."
"Rachel Watson is a down-on-her-luck young woman who rides the train in and out of London every day to hide the fact that she has lost her job from her roommate, and to maintain a tenuous link to what she once was: gainfully employed, happily married and sober. One particular house near the railway tracks fosters an increasingly unhealthy obesssion in Rachel on these daily trips, with its seemingly perfect couple who sit on the terrace. Is it a secret longing for what Rachel once had? Or something more forbidding, something on her own emotional doorstep?With its Hitchcock like setup and close similarity to Gillian Flynn’s work, ‘Girl on a Train’ opens with this compelling story question. Then Rachel’s blurred recollection of a crime she witnesses in a drunken stupor causes her to stumble through the lives of others, wreaking havoc on ex-neighbors, her ex-husband, and aggravating the police, who soon lose patience with Rachel’s drinking and lies. You may actually find yourself doing the same as she keeps hitting the bottle.But ultimately ‘Girl on a Train’ disappoints. It just can’t live up to its promising start.If ever there was an unreliable narrator, it’s Rachel.And this is part of the book’s problem: The reader is too often misled into feeling one way about a character, only to have it not be so. The mystery itself relies too heavily upon Rachel’s opportune blackouts, taking us to the edge of discovery only to learn that she just can’t quite remember what happened. Until she does. And then the murderer does something so dumb (keeping a key piece of evidence any killer worth their salt would surely have gotten rid of) that it violates the ‘maximum capacity’ rule of a worthy villain. He/she also manages to give the clichéd, expository summing up toward the end of the book, explaining in detail the crimes committed and the motives for committing them.Like Gillian Flynn’s books, the parallel to ‘Girl on a Train’ is apparent: multiple narrators switching back and forth in first person as the crime unravels, everyday people living lives of quiet desperation, marriages that appear to be perfect but aren’t. But whereas Flynn’s writing can soar, and her characters are rich and nuanced, Paula Hawkins’ prose is deliberate and too ordinary to make us want to spend so much time in her character’s heads. There are clarity issues in the story telling as well, not helped by the fact that all three narrators are young English women of the same age, same class, with similar backgrounds and voices.Girl on a train is a solid suspense read however, although mystery buffs will find themselves want more."
"I thought this book was dark, depressing and ended poorly.  I also do not think think the author described the characters at all.  I had a hard time connecting to the characters and getting a visual image to go with their story.  I wasted a few hours of my life...."
"This story moves SLOW at first, but around the middle of the book the suspense and terror begins to build.You never really know what a person is capable of, and things are not always what they seem.This book was a really good quick read with plot twist after plot twist. I recommend!"
If I'd have watched it as a movie I wouldn't feel so bad about wasting my time reading it and it would have been the same.  The characters did not have much depth to them.  No surprises in this book one knew who the killer was from the beginning.
"The Girl on the Train is the perfect thriller to read on a trip--it's quick and easy to read, it's intriguing, and it keeps you guessing.I have to say, Hawkins has done a great job at creating a slew of characters to dislike. I don't mean that as a bad thing, though. I thoroughly enjoyed reading a book where I felt like I was my own detective, trying to solve a mystery where I couldn't even trust the narrators. There was some type of a plot twist around every corner, and in the end, I was very much satisfied by the climax and conclusion Hawkins created. (I'll add a quick caveat here that there was one part of the story towards the end about one of the character's backgrounds that is so quickly explained, that it felt like an afterthought thrown in for necessity, but not development--that was disappointing).The only major complaint I had about this book was that so much of it felt unoriginal and cliche to me. The characters were somewhat dull: Rachel is an alcoholic, Megan is a restless obsessive, and Anna is a narcissist. But very little of each of these character's traits were developed further. And the men in this book were so black-and-white that I sort of pity any man who reads this book because the stereotypes are so plain to see--the men are either doting, kind-hearted lovers or oppressive, jealous villains.But then again, maybe these cliches were exactly Hawkins point--to make the setting and characters so ordinary that it made the story just that more chilling."
"Characters were too depressingly crazy to really enjoy this.  The characters were awful people in Gone Girl, but you didn't really know how bad until later - and then it was entertaining how awful they were and had it some darkly funny bits.  Nothing funny here."
"Fun little read. The narrator is so unreliable that it kept me guessing lots of different scenarios--frankly, more complex and interesting ones than what it actually turned out to be. Still, I enjoyed the story."
"This novel is written exactly as a movie, particularly the doble ending, so you're actually reading a thriller you might as well watch in a theater.  The writing is compelling and keeps you reading until you realize this is just another story written by the numbers with a very predictable ending.  Female characters are minimally interesting and the men don't come through as real and the action and red herrings are very transparent. If you are a regular reader of thriller and mysteries, you'll guess this one before you're half way through.  I suggest wait for the film that is already made or buy a cheap used softcover."
"Full of surprises and twisty in the beginning. Because of this it was hard to predict the ending. Some of the characters were highly developed complex and interesting, one or two were less so and sort of stereotypical. But overall, I could not wait to finish the book and enjoyed every minute!"
"Really, more of a 2.5 star review. The initial premise of a troubled woman who becomes engrossed in the ""passing lives"" of a couple whose home she sees daily from her train commute is a good one. Unfortunately, it was the highpoint of the book for me. I'd guessed the plot by about page 60, and really kept reading to see if I was correct. (I was) I truly kept hoping I would be surprised. The story is told from the point of view of three women: Rachel, Megan and Anna, with Rachel being the main character. She's a drunk. Eventually, she becomes an such erratic unlikable, needy repetitive drunk, I was just kind of hoping she'd jump from the train. The plot is facilitated by convenient blackouts, which I could buy into, but it's the clipped points of view of the other two characters that I found to be weak writing. The chapters from Megan and Anna's POV are limited because they're clearly holding back information they know--particularly Megan. A red flag example is a short Megan chapter dedicated to inner thoughts about her lover, whom she refers to as ""he."" The lack of a proper noun tells me the ""he"" she's having an affair with in this chapter is a different ""he"" than was mentioned by name in an earlier chapter. With only so many characters in the book, ""he"" became quite obvious. If you don't think too hard while reading, I can see where The Girl on the Train is an interesting book. I don't think the plot is anything close to masterful."
Much ado about nothing. Don't know what all the uproar was about this book. After all the great reviews and the endless array of character analysis books this one just became drudgery. Characters mundane and very little to grab ones interest. Must be boring to live in the British countryside if this is what the neighbors are like.
"I'm really surprised I didn't love this book. I started it on a flight home, basically highlighting every other quote, wanting to stay up all night after my late night flight and read more. Then somewhere towards 60% (Kindle reader) I realized that I wasn't enjoying the story, but just trying to get to the end. Boo. I wish I enjoyed reading it more, all of the hype around the book had me anticipating to do so. I think Hawkins writing is about average, her character development is above average. The story is interesting, it just didn't hold me after grabbing me, I guess."
This book was just the right combination of thrilling and reality.  I loved the sub plots of the characters as the narration shifted.  The characters are relatable and the story moves at a nice place.  I will be reading more by this author.
"Poorly written book that only has characters that are mentally unstable ..Not worth the money or time to read it , mixed up story that is dragged on and on ..As you can imagine with unstable characters the book makes little sense , I feel that the author had mental issues also , that came out loud and clear ..."
"This is a very, unsettling, thought-provoking novel, and quite the thriller. I. Could. Not. Put. This. Book. Down. The stories of the same event are told in the voices of the three main characters: Rachel, Megan, and Anna. There was so much in Rachel's thought process I could relate to, not necessarily her same issues, but the way she talked things out in her head seemed so much like I do. This is really a dark book about three women finding themselves in very different ways. As much as I loved the book, I hope the next few books I read aren't so dark and heavy."
"This basically seems to be about two young women, one of whom views where she used to live from the windows of a train which stops at a signal every day when she is aboard.  The other lives there  In the end one gets murdered by a friend and the other stabs the murderer with a corkscrew.Have to admit I skipped a lot of the book.  Not really my kind of book."
"While the writing style of going back and forth between characters - perhaps emulating the back and forth motions of the protagonist on the train, the writing itself felt redundant rather than allowing the story to progress. The ""who done it"" aspect of the story is well told and there is intrigue, but I question how this book rose to become a best seller."
"I can't decide so gave it three stars.  I agree wholeheartedly with the ""I hate it one star"" people for all their same reasons.  I've noticed the Gillian Flynn approach to writing becoming more and more frequent and popular.  I call it the ""dare to write a book about despicable characters"" genre.  This book is no different...not one likable, believable character in the entire book...only dipsomaniacs, egomaniacs, sociopaths, narcissists and everything in between.  After 50 pages, I was amazed I went on to finish the book.  With Prime, it's free, so decide for yourself."
"I will admit to reading this book because of all the reviews and the movie coming out. It was a very twisty story, but there was not one redeeming character in this novel, which made it incredibly difficult to enjoy or want to keep reading."
"I found you myself going back through the pages a few times because I didn't know what was going on.  You have to pay attention to all the characters in this book.  I thought it was a page turner, and kept me not wanting to put it down.  It's a little crazy, and that is one of the attributes that keeps you going constantly.  I wanted to find out what in the world was going to happen next.  I picked this book with no one telling me about it, and then found out ""everyone"" was reading it.  The book stands on it's own merit."
"This was difficult to follow.  It must be the latest rage to write this way.  I had difficulty getting started and because I personally don't pay attention to chapter headings it took me a while to realize that I had better pay attention.  Having been married to a person similar to Tom, I figured it could be him early on.  It was still a good mystery.  It is amazing how a person like Tom could make others feel responsible and guilty.  Unfortunately, I lived in that kind of relationship for years.  Fortunately, I didn't turn to alcohol or who knows how it would have turned out."
I read this after it was recommended to me by Kindle First. At first I was a bit confused as to how it was written and took a little bit of pages to get the hang of the style of writing and the flipping back and forth of character writings.  It was very twisting and turning and you didn't know who or what the outcome was going to be.  The ending was definitely a shocker to me and I did not expect that to happen. But thats the beauty of mystery novels is some of them you can predict and others you just don't know until you finally finish the last page.
"An agonizing read...none of the characters are likable.  Their soul-searching is non-stop and painful..  Perhaps that contributes to the suspense, but for me, it just made me want to finish the book and leave these people behind.  I did enjoy the occasional glimpses of life in England, but they were few and lacking in detail.  A good book for lovers of introspection and wallowing in sell blame.."
"Writing from the omnipresent point of view is always dicey with authors.  Sometimes there is so much clutter that it is difficult to separate each character.  This book started out a bit cluttered; however, with each chapter labeled by the character speaking, it didn't take too long to listen to each voice.  I wasn't prepared for the ending, though.  Rather gory and unexpected, but a great way to finish.  I found myself looking forward to ""my time"" so I could finish a few more chapters."
"I liked the book, even though the characters were hard to like.  The author developed them well; I just thought they all had mental issues, except for the baby.It took a while to get into the book.  Seems like all she did at the beginning was ride the train and drink alcoholic beverages before the action picked up....kind of a slow start.  The plot was good, even though I guessed who the killer was before the twist came at the end of the book.It was a study in human nature and the way people relate to each other."
"At the beginning while Rachel was describing what she could see from the train window, I thought of the movie Rear Window and expected a murder. As I read on I was reminded of Gone Girl. It got a bit tiresome and I guessed pretty early on what was going to happen. What bothered me was the style: first person, three different characters yet all written in the same style. I couldn't feel the different personalities. But, as I said before, an easy read so I quite enjoyed it but it left no lasting impressions."
"Fast-paced, confusing at first until all the pieces start coming together, then thrilling and finally chilling! It was hard to stop reading. I flew through the pages barely reading each word. I didn't want it to end but was anxious to know how it ended! I enjoyed reading about the same days from the first person narratives of three women, although at first I felt the need to page back to check dates as each woman reported events from her own perspective. Don't do that. It will come together on its own and the dates will inevitably make sense.  I can't wait to see the movie!!"
"Despite its popularity, I found this book distinctly unpleasant and unenlightening.  Though it was reasonably well written, I thought the technique of alternating chapters from different time periods didn't have much purpose, except perhaps to build some tension that would not otherwise have been there had the events been in chronological order.  The women in the book were shallow, foolish,  and dependent, the men's characters only sketchily drawn.  I thought the book worked as a mystery, but not in other ways, and the characters had few, if any, redeeming characteristics."
"It takes a sensitive writer to lead the reader around the kinds of complications that make modern life so complicated. In this tale, it is important to construct a picture of each woman from the elements presented, with attention to the date of the entry, to be able to have it together by the end. The female characters are individual and unique, yet have a lot in common. The male characters present as somewhat flawed but multifaceted and hard to discount. The intensity of the plot increases along the way, making it harder and harder to put the book down even for a moment."
"Good read, kept me interested until the very end, and i found it interesting to see all the different facets of Rachel, the main character, as well as the other characters. It really makes a good point that people who we assume to be perfect still have their struggles. I loved all the twists and turns the book took and would recommend to anyone looking for a good mystery/thriller."
"There are many references to this as a good follow-up or similar to ""Gone Girl"". I can't agree that there is much similarity except for the chapter format of one character to another. I picked up this book once and couldn't get started because it moved too slow. My second try, I read it in one sitting. It's an interesting device when an author chooses to make not one character to be sympathetic. Rachel is an alcoholic and divorced from man who has remarried but whom she is still in love with. From a train she takes daily twice a day which goes past her own house she fantasizes about a couple of doors down having the perfect marriage, while she obsessively watches developments at her old marital home. All of this is happening in an alcoholic haze which the author realistically depicts. The story picks up steam as it moves which each character develops more dimension. No spoilers here. My only critique is the Agatha Christie wrap up at the end,"
It was a good mystery.  I had trouble at first because it was giving many individual points of view and I didn't get it at first.  It had a surprise ending.  I thought it was a little too drawn out on some of the characters but was good overall.
"This is a really good book, difficult to put down. Easy to read, but not dumb. Lots of comparisons to ""Gone Girl"" but I was reminded of ""The House of Sand and Fog"" in that humans can invite real tragedy just through selfish behaviours or the fog of addiction."
"This is a tough book to review, because I cannot honestly say that I disliked it. I liked it. Begrudgingly, I liked it. It was a quick and easy read. I switched back and forth between the Kindle and Audible versions and though I liked the acting in the audiobook, I found myself just wanting to read because I could do so quicker than listening.This book reminded me a lot of Gone Girl--seemingly complex characters that somehow seem completely base when you get to know them. There is no one to like or root for, which is frustrating, and you are not sure who to trust because there are multiple narrators. Everything leads up to a reveal, which I believe most readers will be able to figure out about halfway through the book, and then the story just ends.Unlike Gone Girl, I believe it was mildly well-written, capturing voice especially well. I also did not feel as if my time was wasted because it was such a fast read, and I did find myself thinking about the stories when I wasn't reading. I gave it three stars because emotionally, I let myself get involved, and any less stars would have been dishonest (but oh how I longed to give it only two!).This is a good beach or vacation read, something to excite you during the mundane winter months or pass the time on a long trip. It is not a life-changing journey, nor is it something that will leave you feeling as if you learned something, but it will certainly keep you guessing."
I wound up putting down the book. Too wordy for me and too focused on the character's drinking. Expected something quicker paced and less psychological. I love English mysteries but this wasn't the one for me.
"I had been wanting to read this book for a while and I'm so glad i finally took the time to do it. Finished it in a day and a half! The book is intriguing and has you hooked from the very first chapter. Excellent read, highly recommended."
"I know that I'm one out of thousands who wrote a review for this book but I just couldn't help myself in relating my viewpoint.  I bought the book from amazon because every article raved about the book, calling it the new ""Gone Girl"", which I also read.  The story revolves around three women; the girl on the train, Rachel, who really should be the ""woman"" on the train because she is no longer a girl, being in her thirties.  Meagan and Anna are the other two women in the story.  Rachel, who is out of work and an alcoholic, gets on the train every day to go to a job that she no longer has and returns at the end of the day to where she shares a flat with another woman.  She is also an ex-wife of a man who has remained in their home, with his new wife, the one who caused the divorce, and their baby.  The new wife is Anna and Meagan is their neighbor.  These people all live in homes bordering the train tracks and so Rachel, on her travels to her non-job, passes by and watches them in their daily lives, still pining away for her ex-husband and builds an imaginary life for Meagan who lives with her husband a few doors down.  As each woman speaks in the novel, you get an insight into what really is going on in her life.  The problem with the story is that Rachel, Anna, and Meagan all appear to have the same personality which confused me and I found myself going back several pages to see which woman was talking.  Since they each had different problems and lives it would make sense that they had varied personalities and would not sound like Rachel.  And even though Rachel didn't want her flat-mate to find out that she lost her job, I couldn't relate to the fact that she was spending every day traveling into London and back again, just to spy on her ex-husband, etc.  Many times I wanted to put the book down and forget it but once I pay for something, I force myself to read on, hoping it will improve, thus the ending, which I found a little more to my liking.  I can't say that this is the ""new"" ""Gone Girl"", because the story is different and I couldn't really get hold of the characters as well as I should.  It's the kind of novel that you take to the beach if you're near one, or read in the backyard for an afternoon.  For a first published novel, I think the author tried to put the story into perspective as she saw it, but I felt I had to push myself to finish the book.  Happily I did so that I could enjoy the ending."
If the story moved a little faster I would have given it a better score.  The story focuses around an alcoholic with little communication with others until about the middle of the book.  She knows she is an alcoholic with no life but does nothing to make her life better.  She basically sabotages anything positive in her life.  The last part of the book is the best part as that is when the most action occurs.  It's not hard to figure out the ending.  I wouldn't totally write this book off as it was an okay read.  I will admit to skipping some pages as they dragged on going nowhere.
"A story that takes very suspenseful and unexpected turns. Wonderful descriptive detail and great insight into the characters.Would recommend this as an easy, fun read. Very entertaining and riveting in many places."
"This is an odd book. Which in a way, makes it stand apart. THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is a great character study, and you feel for Rachel as she spirals into desperation, all the while obsessed with her ex-husband and his new wife. This would probably be enough material for a good book, but the author takes it a step further by adding a mystery, so it borders upon becoming a great book. I do feel this book is weird, but try it, and you may feel as I do: the weirdness makes it compelling. I really like this one. I only give it four stars instead of five because five is perfection...but this book is very, very good."
"The Girl on the Train, by Paula Hawkins, has many thrilling elements, and I could not put it down simply because I wanted to know what was going to happen next. I was held captive by my curiosity regarding the events that Rachel could not remember. I felt that the story was slow and boring at times. I didn’t like any of the characters; in fact I disliked most of them. I wonder if this book became a NY Times bestseller because of the great marketing copy that incited me to buy it, or because people truly enjoyed it."
"What a fantastic psychological thriller..I absolutely could not put this one down!! It's very refreshing to see a main character who is somewhat ""flawed""  like the rest of us, for example, alcoholic, overweight, suffering from depression, etc. The rest of the characters have their own demons and crosses to bear as well. The story line kept me enthralled, as the ""suspect"" seems to change minute to minute, keeping me guessing as to whodunit till the very end. ""Gone Girl"" (while still one of my favorite reads), has nothing on this page flipping, flawed character driven, thriller..."
"The book is well written and edited. No complaints there. But for the most part, it's painfully boring.  The entire story could be told in fifty pages, but the author takes three hundred before making it interesting.The main character is another issue. Pathetic and uninteresting. A loser from beginning to almost end. I would not recommend this book."
This author keeps the reader engaged. The story jumps back and forth in time and from character to character but not in a confusing way. Informative regarding the behaviors of one alcoholic and one pathological liar.
"The title was about something I would do on my commute to work, but her detail about the people who lived on Blenheim Road were regular people with ordinary lives but built these characters to be flawless with perfect families until you find out that they weren't so perfect.  I enjoyed the twists of the plot and wanted to read more to find out who these people were and how the story would unfold."
"This book is a great read for all the reasons that make a good mystery addictive: tight narrative, characters you learn to care about, a flawed protagonist struggling against the odds to solve the case and, of course, the who done it factor.If you read this book and like it, I also recommend ""The Paying Guests"" by Sarah Waters.  Equally intriguing but much higher sex content."
This book felt like it was written quickly with the rhythm of the train grinding to and fro between London and Witley always rumbling past in the back ground. The persistent English rain relentlessly drenches the suburban street where the action unfolds between two sets of couples all of whose lives and in some cases deaths are intertwined with Rachel - an ex-lover - the unfortunate jilted lover watching it all happen from the passing train.Quite similar to Gone Girl in style of writing - maybe they'll make a movie of this one too.
"It is well plotted.... but the way in jumped around in the time line made it difficult to keep the ""players"" straight.  That difficulty may well be mine rather than the fault of the author in an otherwise very good read.DWL"
"Liked: suspense. I did like the twists of ""things aren't always what they seam"" from viewpoint of random stranger looking in from the train...then to discover that viewpoint isn't from ""just a random stranger.""Did not like: predictable in many ways. No real character development of the ""victim"" (Megan).Would recommend? Yes for quick, entertaining, not super thought provoking read. May not change your life but will distract for appropriate amount of time for ""good bang for buck"" entertainment."
"This was a book that kept my interest from the beginning.  I would not compare it to Gone Girl, as others have.  Unlike Gone Girl, I actually liked a couple of these characters...thinking there was some good in them.  There were flawed characters, which was great, but not everyone was completely awful.Overall, the story was interesting and had some nice twists and turns.  I had figured out the guilty rather early, but I had not figured out all the ins and outs.Would recommend!"
"It was very difficult getting into this book. It did nothing until about 2/3 of the way through. Even when I thought something was going to happen and piqued my interest, it fell apart and did nothing. The book was dull, laborious, and even the ending was so-so. I DID manage to finish it though just to see if it would improve, so I give myself credit for that."
Very good book and well written.  Had me until the very end.  A twisting plot where nothing really seemed as it was and had you wondering about the motives of the principle character.  First real book I have purchased in years.  Only because they did not have a Kindle version.  Have passed it along to some other avid readers and so far they love the book also.
"Okay, for me this is a tough review to write.  I ultimately did like this book.  After an adjustment period I got used to the alternating narrators.  There were times when the story drags, but not too many.  I really enjoyed the fact that Rachel, Megan and Anna were very different women, however they do have a lot in common.  Their stories could fit into many of our lives.  I think as the days pass and I find myself still thinking about the story, I have realized that maybe I liked it more than I thought."
I had no expectations or information on the novel content when I bought it.  I kept reading it although I found it repetitive and slow at times.  The characters were well developed.  All were unlikeable.  I figured out the plot two thirds through but again kept reading.  I would compare it to Gone Girl which I read some time ago I found that a more interesting and faster paced read. But thinking about it there was a similarity to the style in which is was written may have been what made me less impressed with this novel.
"I found The Girl on the Train to be fast paced and intriguing. I didn't really like any of the characters, but I don't think they were meant to be likable. I didn't really see the twist coming until the last possible moment. I agree with Stephen King that the alcoholic narrator was spot on. The character's background was laid out well and the suspense built nicely. I didn't think I would like it early on but by the end I was on the edge of my seat."
"This is a very good book and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good thriller. I only gave it three stars because the plot and the writing does not compare to some of my favorite books of all time. If I were to rank this book compared to others in the same genre, i.e., Gone Girl, I would give it four or five stars. It is a very fun read for a weekend trip or a day at the pool."
"It took a while for the plot to become clear, but once it did, the pace of the storyline hastened. I enjoyed the book because it was not clear who the bad guy(s) was until the book was almost done. I would recommend this book to people who are patient because it took a little time to really get into the story and stay with it. I read The Girl on the Train with a small group of coworkers and we all liked it."
"The 3 main characters are whining and annoying.  I didn't care what happened to any of them.  It's a very fast read, which was a good thing because I just wanted it to end.  I kept reading because I did want to find out how they end up.  I will say the ending was exciting, and not what I was expecting.  But I really don't recommend this book."
"This story will shake you to your core. I absolutely couldn't put this down. Whatever you think you know, or remember will only seem like a dream when you come to the last page of this thrilling, nightmarish story. You won't look at people or their lives the same way ever again. If you're looking for some thing to get lost and carried away in, look no further. Anna will tell you what happened that day on the train."
"I was hooked by this novel early on and felt like I was watching the story unfold from the window of the train.  I enjoyed the different characters and how their lives interacted toward the end of the novel.  There were twist throughout and I loved how Rachel & Anna ended up sharing a very important secret at the end. I looked up Paula Hawkins to see if she has written anymore Kindle books, but nothing else came up. I enjoyed her writing style and hope she will write another novel!- Vicki Johnson"
"i was afraid i would not be able to get into this novel so i delayed buying it - boy howdy, was i wrong!! The telling of the tale was much like a train leaving the station, slowly building up speed for the journey. So it was with this book and soon i was swept up in the suspense where i remained until the very end. It was a most excellent adventure! Happy Reading, y'all! :-)"
"I really liked it. It had some twists but for the most part, I figured out ""whodunit"" before it was revealed. I am not sure how to review it properly without giving anything away but I'll just say, if you liked Gone Girl you'll probably like it. However, I did not want to kill someone at the end like I did with Gone Girl! That ending! So bad! But I digress."
"Don't let your mind wander while reading this book!  You have to keep track of who is telling the story or it becomes confusing.  It switches between three women and when the main one is talking you are never sure if she is imaging what is happening or if she is mentally off.  I enjoyed Gone Girl more, until the last chapters of this book.  A lot of backtracking if you put it down and then want to pick up again.  Good if you have nothing else on your mind and can spend hours just on this story.  My husband found the same thing when he started reading it.......he gave up on it."
I liked this book.  It was a fast read.  It kept you guessing who was the villain.  Interesting way of working the story from being a rider on the train. I saw the movie and thought the book was better.
"I really enjoyed this book. It was a page turner that I couldn't put down. I honestly disliked most of the characters, but I couldn't wait to find out what happened. This book brings out a wide range of emotions and I kept hoping the girl on the train would make some better choices and also remember what happened during her blackouts. Can't wait to see the movie!"
"I couldn't wait to read this book...even purchased it on Kindle. It took me so long to read it because I just couldn't get into it. Much of it is backwards (the seemingly new, modern way to write) and the characters are extremely flawed. There was one normal character in the book; however, she played a minor role as the housemate of the main character. I didn't grow attached to anyone in the book nor did I care for the ending which I could see coming. I did like one thing about the ending but won't bring it up because I wouldn't want to spoil for anyone else."
"I don't see what the hype is about. The ending left me dead inside. I hated every character they were all very flawed in there own different way and I didn't like any of them. At the end it got hard to keep going because I didn't like any of them and didn't care how it ended. However, i did think the beginning was a page turner. I thought the ending was pretty obvious."
"You wouldn't know 'who dunnit ' until the end of the book, which is great, but this book didn't live up to its hype. Too vague in the beginning and only after a third of the way through dos I realize each section was written from one of three women's perspectives. To be fair, that may be because I was reading on Kindle and no fault of the author. It's an 'okay' read, nothing to write home about in my opinion <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008A>"
"If I had 15 minutes to spare at any given time, I'd use it reading this book. Those 15 minutes usually turned into a couple hours or more. At first the story reminded me of Hitchcock's 'Rear Window,' then after a few chapters it took on its own identity. Characters were everyday people with common issues that we, or our friends, or someone in our family, may encounter. Details of the lives of those characters are so believable that you will feel like they are your next door neighbors. You won't solve the puzzle and have all the answers - unless you are on the very last page!"
"While I don't particularly like a diary format to a novel, this allowed the reader to be able to see the different points of view of the major characters. The main character had to work out her own issues with depression and alcoholism to be able to attempt a normal life. Her imagery of the people's lives outside the train lent for an interesting murder mystery, all the way to the end."
"This is the first time I have read a book where I have truly disliked all of the characters until nearly the very end. Readers will appreciate the characters' development if they stick it out. Despite my dislike for the characters, the story kept me engaged and wanting to know what would happen next. I'm always pleased when the author does a good job at misleading you about the ending."
"It took a while to get into this book; I found it very depressing initially and put it aside, but picked it up again later and did finish it.While I certainly would not categorise ""The Girl on the Train"" as a must-read book, it is quite entertaining and does have a couple of suspenseful moments; I was quite surprised by the ending.  It is rather more a borrow from the library or a friend book, than must-buy to read again.  Having said that, it is probably not a bad way to spend a rainy Sunday afternoon."
"A wannabe Gone Girl book, gone wrong.  It's a snoozer for the first 100 pages, picks up a little bit, and then finally about 300 pages in, it gets interesting.  I know some people raved about, and perhaps many others will like it, but just didn't do it for me."
"The Girl on the Train is like no other book I have ever read before. Typically I read historical fiction and contemporary romance so this book isn't usually what I would buy but I had heard it was impossible to put down. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the novel even though it was creepy and I felt that nothing quite added up. Something always felt a bit off. The novel had me at the edge of my seat and I finished the second half of the book in one day. I really had a hard time putting it down because the author has a way with storytelling where she ends the chapter with a cliffhanger and I just had to know what happened next. The book switches back and forth between the female narrators and the dates when certain events took place so it was sometimes a bit difficult to follow in the beginning and keep track of where everyone was on the same date but after awhile the dates got closer together and everything came together. The ending was a big surprise to me and I never would've guessed it. Like I said, I don't typically read psychological thrillers but I am glad I took a chance on this one. I highly recommend this novel to everyone, regardless of your preference in literary genres."
"THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A SOAP OPERA PRODUCTION. I KNOW IT IS A BEST SELLER, BUT SO IS THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER."
Thought I was going to love this book! It was so popular and I saw so many people reading it. I waited a bit before reading it because I wanted the perfect beach book. So disappointed. Confusing layout of chapters going between characters and timelines. Confusing storyline with back & forth character side stories. I'll wait until this author writes a second book & give her another chance.
"I'm only about a third of the way through the book and can't seem to make myself pick it up again. I don't like Rachel or Megan. Utterly selfish and self absorbed people. Haven't read much about Anna yet. I can certainly see the twists and turns coming, but I don't really care about any of these women. So far, none have any redeeming qualities, which is what they need."
"This was an excellent, suspenseful book. I really had no idea how it would end and I enjoyed it all the way through!"
"I did not read the book because it wasn't mine.  I bought the book as a gift for my BFF.  This review is HERS, from what she told me.  She LOVED it.  She said she couldn't put it down and, when she finished reading it, immediately wished there was more.  She said she can't wait to see the movie, although she said she doubted it could possibly be as good as the book."
"I kept hearing about this book and was really looking forward to reading it.  I've not yet finished it as I've found it very hard to follow the story line, flips back and forth between present and past, and I have to keep going back to put the pieces together.  I think that, unfortunately, I am just reading it too late each evening and too tired to concentrate so I'm planning to start over when I go on vacation and can dedicate more rested reading time to it.  I'll update my opinion after that."
"Not able to pinpoint why, but this book just did not hold my attention. I think the life of a woman with a drinking problem and depression just did not interest me. As in real life, the self absorption of the alcoholic is boring."
"I love Amazon, quick delivery, easy online service. I bought the Kendel book, a must for readers But as for the book, I understood that Rachel's blackouts and drinking are characteristics of severe alcoholism, and are important in her seeing, or not seeing, important clues. At times, I wanted to stop reading because of the constant drinking. I wanted Rachel to be more thoughtful in the times she wasn't drunk, instead of acting fragile and scared in the last chapters. I'm not a writer, nor am I talented enought to write a book but thrillers and murder mysteries are my favorite genres; I would have liked Rachel to take more control in the final few pages.Having said that, it was very good and justifiably picked for a movie."
"I couldn't put this one down - I stayed up all night reading this book it was completely engrossing. The characters were FULL of surprises, the plot took many turns, and I genuinely cared what happened to the heroine, even though she is extremely complicated. This was well done and the best thriller I've read since Gone Girl. It's hard for an author to have character this complex be so captivating and likeable, but Paula Hawkins pulled it off. It's like when a movie star is able to play a villain that you both loathe and like. It's tough but fascinating, just like this book!"
"This book was amazing.  I don't want to over-hype it but it really was a ""can't put this down till 2 am even though I have to be up at 7"" type of book.  For me at least. It could possibly be because I really didn't care for the book I read right before this one (The Girl in Cabin 10).  This was so much better.  It really kept me guessing up until almost the very end, and then at the VERY end there is a nice satisfying twist.  That's all I can say without spoiling it.. It's our next Book Club book and we are going to go see the movie as well!"
"The Girl on the Train asks questions that our society shies away from. How important is it for a woman to be a mother? If someone cheats, who is to blame? Should an alcoholic be trusted and how much is too much?Rachel tries unsuccessfully to put her life together after her marriage crumbles. She rides the train to and from London everyday, caught up in her thoughts and swimming in the aftereffects of a night of drinking. The train always stops at a row of houses, where Rachel sees Jason and Jess living out their romantic lives. Rachel witnesses an argument between Jason and Jess and the next morning Jess is reported missing. Rachel is thrown into the mystery surrounding Jess’ disappearance while clashing with the lives of her ex-husband Tom and his wife Anna.A cast of suspicious characters make an appearance as Rachel works to discover the murderer. Though the killer’s identity is well hidden, the story reads less as a “who done it” and more like a sympathetic narrative of a suffering woman tossed around by circumstances. I identified with the struggle of the three different narrators, their ugliness ringing as true as their virtues. This is a great summer read and will keep you up as you rush to discover the ending. It is definitely worth missing sleep at night!"
"While this was a  most interesting and entertaining book, and It occupied my thoughts when I put it down, I find I can not give it the four or five stars it would otherwise get from me because the voices of the three main women were too similar. I often had to refer to the name at the beginning of the chapter to see who it was about, or read deeply enough into the story to get the gist. There were no individual telltale words or patterns of expression to tell which one the chapter was supposedly written by. Voice is the only major problem I see."
I enjoyed how the plot is revealed through 3 different female characters. It definitely makes you want to continue on to the next chapter. I thought that Rachel's character was very well developed to the point where I could understand how she operates as an addict even though I have never had those experiences before. I have only seen the trailer of the movie but thought it was more sophisticated than what I pictured by reading the book. But I will only know once I watch it.
"I found it very boring and quite about half way through. I can't understand the reason for the great reviews and sales of this book. It must just be me, but I give it one star because that is as low as I can go."
"""Twice a day, I am offered a view into other lives, just for a moment. There’s something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home.”Rachel Watson rides the train to and from London every weekday. The train stops at the same faulty signal, near where Rachel use to live with her then-husband, Tom. While waiting at the signal, she looks into her favorite track-side house, hoping to see the man and woman who live there. Although Rachel doesn't know them, she calls them Jess and Jason. Rachel has woven a fantasy about them, and they have the perfect life. Except they don’t.Desperately unhappy, Rachel has developed a drinking problem. She is unable to accept that Tom has remarried and lives with his new wife and their baby in the house he shared with Rachel. Rachel has made a nuisance of herself to the point of harassment--calling Tom repeatedly and stopping by to see him, especially after she’s been drinking.What Rachel sees from the train one day will compel her to insert herself into Jess and Jason’s lives and put her own in danger.This story was quick-paced and hard to put down. Although I cringed at some of the things Rachel did, her character was so well-developed, I could sympathize with her. The Girl on the Train is an excellent debut novel, and I can’t wait for more from this author. I highly recommend this book for readers who like a taut, well-written psychological thriller."
"I read this book mostly because I like to read books that are about to become a movie and feel like I've beaten the suspense of waiting for it to come out! anyways, I don't know what all the big fuss is about! I mean it's a good story and all, I didn't see that ending coming but I started to figure it out about 3/4 of the book. I got the audiobook version so the listen is always good! I get a good sense of the characters by who is doing the dialogue. I just felt like the story was being dragged on! I feel like it could've been shorter and we still could've gotten the same ending! I mean I get it! She's a terrible alcoholic but it just kept being dragged on and on! But again this is not my typical read, so for what it was worth it was ok. I think you'll be ok if you just want to wait for the movie though!"
I started to read the book and thought this is slow to start. As you get to know reach character you feel their emotion. It pulls you in chapter by chapter till you discover who is the killer. Excellent read
"This book was very interesting. Kept you wanting to go on ! I kept my interest with all the love and interest. These kind of books just grab your interest.  I feel a lot of this child kid,y do I feel lot of my. I'm feeling as it is my life  sad unloved I'm letting my feelings out not not that I want to.just can. That's alI'm going  to go to bed  ,,so"
"I don't know why everyone thinks this book is so great! After months of hearing how smashing this book is, I finally bought it and was bitterly disappointed. The main character is a jerk. Not because she's an alcoholic, I have compassion for that, it's because she's really unlikeable. I hated this book. My husband got 25 pages in and deleted it, he disliked it more than I did."
"The storyline of this book never uplifts you. It is all about how everybody lies about his/her past, cheats his / her lover or husband / wife, turns to jealousy, violence, over drinking. It can't even claim to be a study of character - it does not dig profoundly enough for it. Neither is it a real thriller - lacking the action and speed.So what is it ? What did the author seek to accomplish with this story ? What did she seek to teach us ? A mystery to me"
This is the most depressing book I have ever read - not a person in the whole book with a redeeming quality except the baby and maybe the roommate but she was dumb for putting up with her. A main character who inspired no feelings in me but annoyance. I only finished the book because I paid full price for it. I can't believe this is on the best seller list. What is wrong with people.
"This book is AMAZING. And I'm telling everyone to read it. Seriously so good, I looked forward to reading it every night before bed. I don't even think the movie will do it any justice. BOMB DOT COM."
"I know some people had difficulties with the main character, Rachel, but I grew to LOVE her. It started off at a relaxed pace, but before I knew it I sacrificed two days of my life to finding out what happened. I felt Rachel and her alcoholic blackouts were frustrating, but I had a lot of sympathy for her. Megan and Anna were harder. The unreliable narrator is a difficult thing to pull off--it takes a writer with a good amount of skill to pull it off effectively, and it's really, really well done here."
"I thought it was hard to get into. Once you got into it the plot was short and then it ended. I would recommend a physical copy of the book rather than kindle version because there are a lot of dates and different characters points of view. I had to keep going back and forth to remember who's point of view and if we were in a flashback or not. It would be a good book to read on a plane, during a road trip, or on a rainy weekend. It's best to not stop reading so you don't get confused."
"Nothing against the author or the book. It appeared on my Amazon list of books and I figured that it would be in-line with what I like to read given the title. It wasn't!No offense, but this book is not for guys. I went as far as 60% waiting for something to happen, and when it didn't, I gave up. If you're a guy, you won't like this book."
"Although tightly written, the main characters are mostly unlikeable an, on the whole, not very sympathetic.  There is some resolution of the characters' flaws at the end of the novel but too little, too late for me, and I write this review as someone who likes stories with damaged protagonists.  Told from several viewpoints, the author opts to not give us insights into the mind of the true driver of the story's plotlines and, by doing so, the plot twists do not have the devilish comeuppances that occur in""Gone Girl"" (to which I've seen this novel compared)."
"Overall, a good read. The plot and they way the book/chapters were formatted were interesting and kept me wanting to read in and figure out what happens. However, at times I found my myself simply wanting to continue reading not because I was enjoying the story, but more because I just wanted to know how it ended and ""who did it."" Being a fan of more complex writing styles and literary-type books this was not a book I'd normally read, however for those who enjoy a good mystery/drama with a primarily female-focused storyline, you may like this."
"Had read a review in a magazine and was looking forward to reading it.  Very suspenseful and reminiscent of ""Gone Girl""  I have recommended it to friends."
"I found the book okay but nothing special.  Disliked the idea that the main character was in some type of stupor due to alcohol in the entire book so it made the entire story somewhat boring.  I prefer my main characters to be in full command of their senses and have a little more realistic goals and have a stronger character. Nevertheless, it was okay but perhaps my gender had something to do about my analysis of it. Uper"
"I only read this book because it was so highly rated, and my Kindle kept telling me I would like it, but I didn't. At all. The story and characters were so unrealistic, unnecessary sub-plots were left unanswered which made them all the more irritating, and the ending was simply ridiculous. I would have given more stars had the ending been slightly believable."
"The ""payoff"" ending was rather lame.  The writing was good, but as a male, it was excruciating being inside the minds of 3 three women that were extremely uninteresting, needy and weak.  It took me a while to guess the ending, as this author keeps it pretty well hidden.  But the ending was about as exciting and clever as a Lifetime movie.  I'm surprised at all the glowing reviews, but what do you expect from a society that thinks The Big Bang Theory is gut splitting."
"Bought it to relax by the summer pool and know what the fuss was about (had actually gifted it to someone earlier but still didn't know much about it).Read it in under 24h because I simply could not put it down. The characters are profoundly human, flaws and virtues (ok mostly flaws in this story) showing in more or less explicit ways throughout the story. Interesting, thrilling, gripping."
"This book was pretty amazing, despite the lack of characters that I could relate to or even like. This book has similarities to Gone Girl, but there's so much more to it. Halfway through the book was when it started to get good, and honestly I rushed it these last few days just because I wanted to watch the movie. Overall, I'm glad I read it and the end was shocking to me!"
"I read this book on my Kindle, and unfortunately, the chapters were headed in very light printing. I didn't notice the headings at first, and was very confused. When I finally realized that the order of events kept jumping forward and backward and from person to person, I figured it out (FINALLY!) Didn't mind reading chapters about each person, but the way the order of events was presented was not my favorite way to read a book. Other than that, I kind of liked it.....I think if I read it again, I will like it better!"
"I thought it was an interesting premise and the characters' challenges  kept my attention.  I think some points were made and restated too many times.  Although the alcoholic blackout is integral to the plot, it is not a book about the perils of alcoholism, per say.  It does show the struggle to regain control and independence  following a series of unhappy events and relationships."
"I understand the creativeness of the storyline, but it was just not my type of writing.  I found myself avoiding reading it, but being a compulsive reader, I would not put it away for another book- I was bound and determined to finish it.Maybe I just couldn't focus on the names. For a while i mistakenly thought that Rachel was delusional and was actually Meagan and Ann.  I was confused- maybe because of the Jason and Jess thing...Anyway, I am glad I finished, but sort of wished I hadn't started."
"This is an exciting read.  I like the way the chapters are divided up by the characters of the narrative, all of them women.  And, the women are not entirely likable.  I found myself unsympathetic at times, but drawn to their flaws, dramas, and insecurities.  It was a view of modern women but not the most modern of sensibilities--a pseudo-'60's millennial feel for one of the characters.  I don't want to give anything away, but one habit I had was to constantly check the dates of the narrative, whomever the author was focusing on--it goes back and forth, and drives the narrative forward and makes it suspenseful, but a bit hard to keep track of. What I liked about the read is that I commute daily to work on a train--reading standing up in a crowded train, sitting down, even missed my stop a couple of times.  Definitely worth reading..."
"Slow and depressing, however one can see lot's of reflections to our society and how distant people became from each other. It was not stricking as a good thriller, but was a rather well balanced sociology essay, I'd say"
"A fine, absorbing mystery.  I have to admit I figured out the mystery before the end, but I read lots of mysteries and recognize the subtle clues.  Still, I enjoyed it thoroughly, and the ending did surprise me. It's an interwoven story, alternating between the perspective of three different women. They are connected to each other either through marriage (one is an ex-wife of a male character, the other the second wife) or by the fact that they live/lived in the same suburban neighborhood south of London.  The ex-wife, Rachel, devastated by the breakup, is reduced to alchoholism and emotional instability. She drunkenly harrasses her ex-husband and his new wife, and dreams of what might have been as she passes her former neighborhood on her train commute.  She becomes fixated on another couple in that neighborhood that she glimpses on these trips.  One morning she witnesses the woman with a different man, and her illusion of the perfect couple she had in her head is shattered.  She becomes even more disturbed when the woman, named Megan, disappears without a trace.  Determined to find out what happened, she inserts herself into the investigation by reporting what she saw to the police.  Hampered by her abuse issues and a blackout that occured the very night Megan disappeared, and unaware of Megan's own emotional issues, Rachel's desperation to find the answers lead to some interesting revelations and a final confrontation with the person responsible for Megan's disappearance."
"I bought this book for my wife, and she has had nothing but good words for it. She has tried a number of times to get me to read it and I'm sure one of these days I will. We have the Kindle version so unless we lose our e-reader the book will always be available. My eysight is bad so I am subscribed to a Talking Library organization and they recently sent me a recorded version of the book. If they have it in their collection it has to be a good book. Doing this review has brought the book to the top of my list of things to do so I have to get started on it. Book reviews and my wife highly recommend this book so I would say get it, and enjoy!  JLM"
"I really liked this book. I was skeptical that I would like it as much as I did, given how some reviewers compared it to Gone Girl, which I hated. There were some slow spots, and the main character's drunkenness got a bit tedious at times. However, the author did a great job building suspense. I was sure I knew the identity of the killer early on, but the twists and turns in the story made me realize my initial assumption was incorrect. Kudos for tricking me, even though I did figure it out before any of the characters <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084>"
"Fun Mystery with Interesting Twists-Rachel, the initial narrator, is an outsider, an alcoholic who rides the train to and from a job she no longer holds.  As the story develops she is no longer an outsider but rather very much an insider.  I liked her as a narrator even while her actions drove me crazy.  So easy to sit on the outside and say well why didn't she just...... but in the end I appreciated her weakness coupled with the desire to change and become a better person, or perhaps more appropriately, a whole person. All of this also seemed to play an integral part in the story.When the voice of the victim Megan was added as a second narrator the story took on a different reality and the mystery began.  As Rachel filled her empty days riding the train she made up stories about Megan and her husband and their idyllic life, a life Rachel no longer had.  It was no surprise that their life was not as it appeared from the outside.  No one's ever really is, is it?Yet a third narrator, Rachel's husband's new wife, is added.  To me she was the least interesting of the three but helped bring in some background that could not be revealed by Rachel or Megan.I felt like there were an appropriate number of suspects offered up and that the twists and turns were interesting and not too obvious and believable based on the characters.All in all, I found this a good, entertaining read."
"I didn't care that much for it.  I didn't like the way it was written in singular persons, every chapter was a different character telling their story.  It did have a twist in the end.  I didn't like reading about all the drinking."
"I confess. The suspense in The Girl on the Train got so far under my skin that I couldn’t stop until I’d read the book all the way through to the end, costing myself hours of sleep. With as much as I read, this doesn’t happen very often, even with the most skillfully written thrillers.So there’s plenty of suspense here — but not a whole lot more. The Girl on the Train was heavily marketed as the successor to Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl, an amazingly well crafted thriller that has been on or near the top of national bestseller lists for a very long time. This one doesn’t measure up to that (admittedly) high and possibly unattainable standard.This is essentially the story of three young women, told in alternating chapters from the perspective of each of the three: Rachel, a divorcee; Anna, who is married to Rachel’s ex-husband; and Megan, who lives with her own husband. Megan and Anna’s homes — the latter was Rachel’s home not long before — are situated along the tracks of the train that Rachel takes every day to and from work. Prone to fantasizing, Rachel builds an elaborate story around her daily glimpses of Megan and her husband, neither of whom she has met. The plot unfolds as the women’s stories intersect — and, you guessed it, it’s not a pretty tale.If there’s a message in The Girl on the Train, it may be summed up in a single sentence by the author: “I have never understood how people can disregard the damage they do by following their hearts.”Oh, and there’s another message to take from this book: beware of marketers who hype new books as “a worthy successor to [fill-in-the-blank]."
"The plot isn't bad, but the characters are very poorly written.  Apart from the fact that none of them are likeable, they simply aren't very distinguishable either.  The women all have similar personalities - weak judgment, bad decision-making, easily manipulated, bad tempered.  And the male characters were equally unoriginal and similar to each other - self-centered, mean, capable of violence.At the start the book had some promise.  The premise, while in some ways derivative of Hitchcock's movie ""Rear Window,"" seemed interesting.  A woman who commutes into London every day sees something suspicious as her train passes by the backyards of a small subdivision.  The story evolves from there as the suspicious event starts the unraveling of several lives, as described alternately by some of the main characters.But while the book is an easy read, and the essence of the mystery holds the reader's attention reasonably well, I found myself racing to the end not because it was so exciting but just to be done with the book.  The cast of characters, and especially ""the girl on the train,"" comprised a collection of some of the most unlikeable individuals I've ever encountered in a novel of this type and I couldn't wait for the story to be over.  As they repeated the same stupid mistakes over and I over I wanted to shout out, ""No, not again, please!""I've not read anything else by Paula Hawkins but, based on this book, I probably won't add her to my list of regular authors."
"After reading so many good reviews I was looking forward to reading this novel. Sadly, I was quite dissapointed. Maybe my expectations were too high. The characters were not developed and the plot was predictable. On the positive side it iwas a quick and easy read."
"The title was about something I would do on my commute to work, but her detail about the people who lived on Blenheim Road were regular people with ordinary lives but built these characters to be flawless with perfect families until you find out that they weren't so perfect.  I enjoyed the twists of the plot and wanted to read more to find out who these people were and how the story would unfold."
This is a fast moving read which has many twists and turns. It is a murder mystery through the eyes of an alcoholic who has been put down and made to feel less than average until she marries the love of her life - a man she adores. In due course the marriage breaks up due to her drinking.through the window of the train she idealises a couple who live in a house in the same street her husband and his new wife a baby live - her house. She imagines them as the perfect couple.... read on.Jayjay
"There's a good reason this is coming out in movie format.  It's GREAT!  Kind of made me feel engrossed in the same way ""Gone Girl"" did.  I had to keep checking the time line to keep things straight in my head.  I'll be interested to see how the movie works with that.  Let your imagination take you through the visuals your mind creates before watching Emily Blunt create a whole different picture.  I'm sure the buzz about the movie is right and this will be a winner.  How could it not be with that woman acting the starring role in a story this dark?"
Kept my attention but hard to get into. The characters are not very likable and their constant poor decision making and low self esteems made me uncomfortable and frustrated. Wrapped up a little too neatly at the end.
"I would have liked to have seen some more development (I daresay purpose) to some of the details mentioned about the characters in the book. Some of the details seemed very important and by the end, they turned out to be irrelevant."
"Great suspenseful book. I couldn't put it down.  I don't usually read fiction books; I'm more of a non-fiction and biography reader.  This book was chosen for a book club that I was a member of, so I figured that I better read it so I could be part of the conversation.  I'm so glad that I did because I had a hard time putting this book down.  When I had to put it down to, I couldn't stop thinking about what was going to happen next.  It was a really well written book with great character development.  I wish the ending was a little different (I kinda saw that coming towards the end of the book)."
"Wonderful British murder mystery but more than that, the protag is a drunk, something we don't see much in novels. She is struggling with alcoholism and her credibility is compromised. I loved this twist.TGOTT is a murder mystery that takes place in the suburbs of London England. A woman who's been replaced by her husband (in his life and their house) notices the neighbors from the train and becomes engrossed in their affairs. It's a case of voyeurism and more.The novel is written beautifully, flawlessly. The mystery is compelling with the author feeding us just the right amount of information about each character to let us think they could've been the killer. Well done."
"At first, it was difficult to get into the story. A bit confusing and a lot of back and forth between characters and dates. Fortunately, for me, there were only three character's point of view. I finished the book in three days. The first day was arduous, but once I started again, the second day, it was almost challenging to put the book down. Finally, on the third day, I couldn't stop until I finished it. Surprising twist at the end and at times I suspected it could be..., but then thwarted the idea of it being so. Definitely a great, suspenseful read."
I didn't care for the book.  There are 3 main female characters who in my opinion are not very likable.  They are varying degrees of neurotic.  I found them all so unlikable I couldn't really relate or empathize with their plot. I felt like I was listening to a bunch of gossipy petty woman which is not the company I would choose to keep.  The plot had some twists towards the end but was unbearable getting to the grand finale.  The suspense didn't justify putting up with the female characters......the main one was just plain annoying to listen too.
"Sure the plot devices of this novel are a little silly and far-fetched. Sure the main character gets asked to specific locations because the story requires it in order for the plot to continue. Sure the ending deserves a couple of eye-rolls.But who cares? The central mystery of the novel is compelling enough to make you HAVE to know how it ends. I read the entire book in a day and would recommend it to anyone who likes to read FOR FUN.Haters gonna hate, but this book has more mystery and suspense that 99% of basically everything else."
"Marketed as being like Gone Girl, which is a tough act to follow for any author, but this is not even in the same league. It is a story as tawdry as any tabloid grief porn and the characters are unsympathetic. I feel sullied for having read it."
"I didn't like that the main character was a fumbling drunk.  It made the story less interesting to me, and never really grabbed my attention.  I found myself a little bored at times not really caring what happened next.  I don't think I would recommend this book."
"Well written, good character development, plot decent but is hinged on the deficiencies of the main character which should  be interesting ( nice change from the strong leading lady type) yet was sometimes tedious."
"This book is about 3 totally dysfunctional women who consistently make stupid mistakes.  Unfortunately because it is written in the first person of all 3 women, and despite the fact that one of them is a blackout drunk, they all have the same dysfunction and I found myself in the first few chapters having to look back to figure out which women was currently  narrating.  I guessed the ending long before there was an actual hint of it because it was so obviously omitted from the narrations. I could accept the stupid mistakes made when in  a drunken blackout, what was more difficult to accept was a seemingly educated women (after all before she became a drunk she had a really good job)  could make the same stupid mistakes when sober! All 3 women were so focused on doubt and self loathing that you never saw the actual point of view of the two male main characters.  In real life even doubters would wonder was it their own flaws or flaws of others and I would expect to see that in the narrations but alas it was excluded.  I read it through rather quickly really hoping to be surprised by my early on guess of the ""bad guy"" Alas, I wasn't, so it was rather anti-climatic. Bottom line, none of these characters were likable but I found I didn't hate any of them either.  They just depressed me!  The premise was good but quickly became to predictable."
"When Rachel's world falls apart, she consoles herself by concocting a fantasy perfect life about a young couple she can see in their home every day as she passes by on the train.  The story is told in first person, present tense and gradually we learn more about Rachel and why she is alone and brooding over strangers. The reason she is looking towards this road is because her ex-husband lives there - in her marital home - with his new wife and their baby. To distract herself from her husband's new family, Rachel broods nostalgically over the seemingly perfect couple down the road, until she discovers they are not perfect either.  Then the wife (Megan) disappears and Rachel is convinced she has evidence to tell the police.  But will they believe an unstable obsessive woman whose only knowledge of the case comes through glimpses from the train?As Rachel grapples with her own demons and tries to solve the mystery of Megan's disappearance, she makes some self-destructive decisions - meanwhile, the reader learns more about Megan through her own first-person narration, and also Anna who is now married to Rachel's ex-husband.  Rachel, Megan and Anna all have their own flaws, darkness, vanities and fragility, which draw them unwittingly together into a destructive bond.The information about each character is revealed slowly and logically, as all the interweaving relationships become more complex and transparent. The final conclusion is satisfying and complete with no further unanswered questions... only bleak hopes that the future will be better for the survivors of this tragedy."
I was bored with the redundancy in the first 23% of the book.  Everyone told me to stay with it and it would get better. This proved to be true and the last 25% of the book was well written and it was hard to put down.  I feel 3 stars is kind of a stretch.
The story runs all over the page. Constantly requires jumping back a chapter to figure out who is doing the story telling . Thought it would be better given its meteoric rise on best seller list. What a disappointment.
I was captivated and confused by the dates that were at the beginning of each chapter.  I tried to keep track-But ended up just reading it through. I got tired of flipping back on my I pad.A great mystery.
"I saw the trailer about the moving coming up in the fall and got curious, did some research and decided to get the book. Started exactly a week ago and simply read more every night before going to bed and found it very interesting and a clever story telling, my imagination was going into many directions and I was intrigued as to solve the mystery and then I realized than I have read 80% of the book and I knew it .... It will have to be wrapped up, the ending will be disappointing and so it was - short and predictable.Regardless it was a great source of entertaining and a very good reading almost to the end, so given the option I'll do it again."
"I bought this book because of all the wonderful reviews. It was ok, almost a study of alcoholism, but not the edge of my seat thriller I was expecting. I wish I had saved the 5.99 and got it on a daily deal."
"This was a well written, suspenseful book from beginning to end. The female characters were well developed and believable. While on the whole not getting too ""deep"", there were still a few very insightful parts- one particular passage stuck with me: ""....the holes in your life are permanent. You have to grow around them, like tree roots around concrete; you mould yourself through the gaps"".  Less attention was given to the male characters. Overall, this was a good, fun read- perfect for the beach. A real page turner."
"Everyone looks out the window at houses while driving by, but maybe not quite so obsessively as Rachel. But curiosity kills the cat right? Rachel's obsession and imagination leads her down a dark track. The story is interesting how it is given to us piece by piece, making you want more info as you go along. All of the characters are flawed, nobody is what they seem. Except maybe Rachel's roommate who is a saint.  Good book, can't wait to read more from this author."
"This was a very dark story with a cast of dysfunctional people, each worse than the last.  Although it ends on a positive light, I didn't really like any of the characters and didn't care much what happened to them.  This book has been compared with Gone Girl, but I found that one much more engaging than The Girl on the Train."
"I had heard so much about ""The Girl on the Train"" & had recently seen the preview for the movie. I decided that I had to read it before the movie came out! I was not disappointed. An easy read, yet not one that you get bored with. I had a feeling of who the ""other man"" was from the beginning, and was right. Was still kept guessing about things throughout the whole book though!"
"I felt that the combination of weddings were very interesting.  The ""man and wife"" changes created many different ""scenes"" in the  book.  I wrote them down, so that I could keep track of them while I was reading:Tom & Rachael,  Anna & Tom,Mac & MeganScott & Rachael  And the ending, for me WAS UNEXPECTED!  Our monthly Book Club discussion was today, and this was the book we discussed... AND the discussion was really interesting and GREAT!  Geri Rodin"
I'm not sure what the fuss on this books was/is?  I was disappointed.
"I know many people enjoyed this.  However, I read a ton...like 2 books a week.  And having experienced so many wonderful stories - this one falls short.  The main character is boring and whines about everything (think Goldfinch guy boring) - life is ""all too much"" sort of saga.  If you're into folks struggling to overcome an issue - maybe this is for you.  I felt that after I read it; I'd learned nothing and had wasted my time.  No offense to the author - just not my type of book."
"Very exciting, fast moving ""noir-ish"" mystery. It's as though you are the passenger on the train getting glimpses from the window. Alternating the narration between the three main characters gives a realistic and dramatic sense of the power of perspective. I highly recommend this. It's one of those books you shouldn't start reading unless you know that you have time to read right through to the finish.  Even if you can put it down, you won't be able to concentrate on anything else until you can get back to it."
"This book is definitely a ""guilty pleasure"" type of read. You won't gain much from the story per se, but it's definitely a page turner. Is it worth the hype? Eh. Unfortunately, at the end...I was left thinking ""well that was a fun read,"" which isn't bad, but It definitely could have had more substance.  Overall, a fun and quick summer read that can be finished within a day or two."
"At first it was a bit hard to follow but then, then it hooked me and it would not let me go. Crazy ending that was so unexpected."
"I enjoyed reading this book. This is a murder mystery written through the eyes of the main characters in the story. So the reader has to get used to switching between first person accounts. This works well providing different points of view on the same narrative. The main character, Rachel, is very believable, an unemployed alcoholic, she blunders on revealing more of herself as the story develops. The Plot moves along well, with plenty of twists and turns. I didn't solve it until right at the end. This is well worth reading."
Kind of predictable at end - I think. But still a good read!
"This author has used multiple narrators to weave a thrilling suspense story that starts slowly and  quickly becomes a speeding train ride.  The interesting twist is that the reader cannot really connect with a single one of the main characters, as they are all so flawed as to be unloveable.  The story is told so well, though, that you want to know ""whodunnit"" regardless of the fact that it won't matter to you who dies or goes to jail!  Reminiscent of Gone Girl, this first effort should have readers looking for this authors next novel with great anticipation."
"This book has been recommended to me from my kindle and is on reader's lists and NY best sweller.  However, I found the characters annoying and the exciting part of the book was the last few pages!  I love to read and like to be entertained by the story.  This was not the case.  The characters were far from flawed, they were a mess!  Wouldn't recommend this book if you like an interesting story."
"Enjoyed Girl on the Train so much.  It seemed to build up slowly with each chapter being from the point of view of a different character but it was cleverly done and I found myself wanting to get back to the book as often as possible.  It was difficult to decide who were the good people and who the bad which made it more intriguing, especially the main character (the girl on the train) who was so often drunk that she didn't know whether she was bad or good. Well done. Would recommend this reading."
"At first a slow moving story and difficulty understanding who is who but once that all falls into place it is an interesting glimpse into several lives and how they intersect.  The damage alcohol causes a life is clearly described.  If you like Jodi Picoulet style, you'll like this story also.  I like to try to guess how it is going to turn out and this story was not easy to figure out.  Reading on a kindle is harder because you can't go back and re-read parts as easily if it were an 'ear-marked' book !  But overall an good read !"
"This has great tension throughout, whether it is about the personal situation of Rachel - can she overcome her alcoholism?  - or about the mystery of the disappearance of Megan. Cleverly written, and very relatable - we all look out of trains, cars etc. and imagine the lives of people in the houses we pass: add on Rachel's unique, foggy lens, and it makes for an exciting journey!"
"I hated this book and all of the characters, even the man on the train opposite our ""heroine"" and he didn't even have a speaking line.  None of them had one redeeming quality.  I am in the minority here and I get that, but gee, I needed to like someone and care about them.  Apparently this is not a genre where everyone is despicable is one that I like."
"It was a good book and I'd recommend it to others but as other reviewers before me mentioned, its a bit annoying when a villain reveals their motives in great detail at the very end. I don't like this in movies, even much less in books. The climax could have been built differently. Also didn't find any of the characters likable except for maybe Cathy."
"Ugh!  I almost put it down after 50 pages.  I just don't care for the characters or the story line.  I kept waiting for it to get better, if you know what I'm saying. Sadly, I paid more for this book because I was anxious to read it. I was happy to finish it, and be done with it.  Wait until your can purchase it for $1, at least then you get what you paid for!"
Great book with well developed characters. I wish there was one male that could have been a role model.  It's almost like the person who wrote it sees all men as cruel and uncaring of women.
"FAST READ WITH INTRIGUING CHARACTERS.  Reading Paula Hawkins book is like having a big chocolate bar when you know you shouldn't and you can't help yourself when you go back for more.  There's something to be said about shifting time references and 1st person narratives.  If you aren't careful - you'll miss something as you blast through the pages.  If you are on a long flight or need an engrossing diversion when your family makes you completely crazy, make a sandwich, lock yourself in your bedroom and settle in.  It will melt the stress away."
"This is an absolutely compelling read.  The plot unfolds and takes unexpected twists, while the characters gradually reveal themselves and their secrets.  Paula Hawkins did a masterful job of matching the train's rhythms with the momentum of the story.  It started off haltingly, got traction, then gained runaway speed.  Two thirds of the way through the book I couldn't stop reading until I reached the final page.  There are some farfetched turns, unlikely plot twists, and some characters that just don't seem ""fleshed out"".  Still, what a ride!"
"The story is complex and well thought out. I really enjoyed this book even though I'm not super into mysteries.The idea of a main character so flawed and dysfunctional that she seems like a hopeless person is actually pretty cool. You're reading about this utterly pathetic woman stumbling around and you're thinking, ""ok, how can a book be about a person like this?"" So then that becomes intriguing, and you keep reading to find out how she got into that state whether she'll manage to pull herself together."
"Not that big a deal. Story felt like it could have been 10,000 or 20,000 words shorter. Too much of it felt like s t r e t c h i n g.Characters just fumbling around in a deliberately unclear story felt annoying to me.Depressed drunk stumbling around in unclear memories just got irritating.Best part of the story was trying figure out the various possible story lines, possible ways it would play out.The ending is one of the endings that will occur to you.-To be honest it's a mystery to me why this book is so popular."
"I initially bought this book 2 weeks ago to read on a cruise. I didn't end up reading the book on the cruise but decided to actually pick it up about a week ago.I found it to be fast paced without the use of any deep thinking. I enjoyed the un-reliable narrator aspect of it which definitely kept me turning the pages.Although I had my suspicions of the actual perp about halfway through the book, I kept wondering if there would be a big turn all the way up to the big reveal.Good read on a rainy day."
I do not understand why this novel has been on the New York Times best sellers list for so long or why it is being made into a movie. Im found it confusing and storyline jumbled and bumbled.
"I really wanted to like this book, I really did.  I was intrigued enough to finish it because I wanted to know who dunnit, but there were many times I wanted to put it down and just walk away.  After finishing it, I was left with a feeling of let-down. I could have cleaned the house and gained more satisfaction with the use of my time.  I realize the world is not always a pretty place, but the characters in the book did nothing to inspire me."
"Sorry, but I got really tired of listening to Rachel's constant whining.  I kept thinking is this story just about an alcoholic trying to find meaning in her life?  This book was presented as a thriller mystery!  I kept skimming to see if it ever picked up.If you ever have a hard time sleeping, this would be the perfect book to read.  You will out in no time."
Rachel a divorced woman that rides the train daily gets wrapped up in mysterious missing girl mystery. Rachel watches a loving couple from the train window twice a day until one day she witnesses another man with her. Shortly after seeing this the girl goes missing. Rachel gets involved trying to help the girl's husband. Rachel has  a history in the neighborhood and a drinking problem that makes her story questionable.This story has many twists that keep the story interesting and unpredictable. I got hooked and it was hard to stop reading.
"Rachel, the girl on the train, is a divorced, unemployed, blackout alcoholic, who rides the train everyday to her imaginary job. The highlight of her day is viewing a couple from the train as they sit on their terrace. Rachel has given them made-up names and a perfect fantasy life. This couple lives several houses down from the house where she had once lived with her ex-husband, who now lives there with his current wife and child. Rachel had wanted a child desperately and blames her alcoholism on the fact that she couldn't get pregnant. She has a tendency to phone her ex-husband when she is drunk and has actually  broken into his house and taken the child out of it. When the woman from the terrace goes missing, Rachel becomes involved in it to the point of obsession, partly because of her brief memories of her drunken behavior on the night the woman disappeared.  The book is addicting. I could not put it down. Rachel discovers some truths about her life as well as the true murderer.  The characters are all very well developed, but I would have liked to know a bit more about the murderer.  That is my only complaint and it isn't really a complaint. Fascinating main character and one you believe will get her act together when the book ends. The Girl on the Train is so far superior to Gone Girl, a book I found predictable with way too much dialog to make it interesting, that I don't know why it is compared to it."
"I loved  this book I read it twice which I have never done before. if you were a heavy drinker or if you knew one in your life you will relate to Rachel, who is the main character in this book. the beginning was hard to follow for me. the book is told in three characters Rachel, megan, and anna. who by the way are all connected in  some way which you find out as you get to know these people. Rachel gives a lot of misinformation thru out the book aka blackouts dreams ect. related to her being an alcoholic which adds a Hitchcock feel to this story. it is a mystery novel . the book is slow in the beginning till you get to know who megan and anna  are, but hold on the book takes off like a running train lots of twists in this. Rachel was awesome throughout the whole book and the ending is awesome  I can't get Rachel out of my head!!! without giving anything away you will have a different perspective for Rachel and be amazed of what she can do in a crisis.  I hope there is sequel"
"At the beginning, and up to a point, this book is very intriguing.  The structure takes a few chapters to grasp as different characters are narrating from different time perspectives.  But as the story goes on, and on, I began to get impatient for the story to just end.  Sadly, the ending is ultimately very disappointing.  Whatever suspense was created at the opening just fades with the rather expected ending.  One other thought: I remember reading a critique that noted that men cannot write fleshed out female characters.  Well, the same may be true about women authors and male characters.  The two main male characters are not developed at all and serve as little more than plot points.  Frankly, there's a touch of misandry in the writing."
My heart is still pounding from finishing this book. It is a very dark psychological thriller. I couldn't put it down. It is disturbing. If you don't like DARK books pass on this one. I wish I would have passed. The writing is superb. I liked the way the author told the story by everyone's perspective.  It is why I'm giving it 4 stars but don't be mislead by that. I'm glad I didn't see the movie. I wish I wouldn't have read the book.
"Typical read time for me is one to two evenings if I love the book, a week or two at most if it's just ok. I have been working on getting through this novel for well over a month.  The story is disjointed and has no flow. Still not finished but it seems to be picking up a little speed about 3/4 way through. Ironically the characters and writing are good, it's the storyline which, as the reader, seems to fall short in catching my attention."
"This book was selected to be read in my monthly book club. Unlike some book clubs, we actually read the books! I really wanted to like this book but I just found it really difficult to keep the characters straight. I was constantly trying to remind myself who was who and flipping back to previous chapters to make sure I knew which character the author was referring to. This was just not a good book for me. I probably have ADD or ADD tendencies so this book did not help with that at all. I will say that there is a great plot twist at the end - I considered this to be my reward for hanging in there until the end."
"I was hooked from the first few lines, as the story quickly provoked this addicting curiosity, that had me flipping page after page; I finished it in two days, even with other life (#adulting) obligations. I found the ending to be a bit ""Lifetime movie climax,"" but it did not make me like the novel any less.  It'll be hard to find a book I get this hooked on again. I hope the movie doesn't disappoint (past the interesting casting choice for Rachel:  Emily Blunt, a gorgeous actress). Anyway, do read!"
"Well written and great surprises.  Normally I can figure out a plot pretty early on in the story but this one left me surprised.There may have been a couple of plot holes in one of the story lines with one of the narrators leaving a key piece of information out that should have been said if she was to be believed in the rest of the story, but I'd need to re-read it to see how she danced around that piece of information."
"Not exactly great ""literature"" but once you make it through the slow beginning it opens with, you are along for the ride of a woman who thinks of herself as an alcoholic loser who bumbles into a mystery that she can't let it go.  I highly recommend this book for good old fashioned escapism and entertainment. You will find yourself rooting for this appealing, loser as she tells the story that unfolds in present time, first person narrative."
"Most of this book is slow moving and boring . The last fifty pages try to make up for a wasted experience.The fact that it on the nytimes best seller list is disappointing. A much better read that I enjoyed was "" The Perk""By Jiminez."
"Scripted reality TV in book form, or maybe an overly dramatic  soap opera from the 80s. Mega drama, and completely  forced connections between characters.  Really don't get all the buzz around this book."
"I could have, actually should have, stopped reading this about half-way through, but since it is on the Bestseller List (which I should know better -- that does not translate to a good read), I persevered, hoping that it would get better.  Half-way through the book, I'm thinking that each chapter is a rewrite of the previous chapter --  Rachel the drunk conjures up a life for people she has seen but has never met.  Well, except for Tom, he ex-husband, who she continually harasses along with his wife.Find another mystery because this one has no surprises."
"Interesting style. Took me a while to get used to the author's approach. I had to check frequently to know for sure who was speaking in individual chapters. The first person, self-analytical narration provides quality insight into the characters minds. Enough suspense and twists to maintain interest. The beginning and end of the novel were the best parts for me."
"Just took too long to get to anything significant happening. These people are all so scummy that I skipped to the end after page 147. Tom and Anna are the biggest sleezebags from the beginning and its actually really unbelievable that people like this actually exist. If you've ever been dumped after being cheated on, this book will do nothing but infuriate. I'm actually mad at my friend who suggested this and I won't ever forgive her for it."
"This story immediately brought me back to my commuting days, boring house spent wondering about the people who lived along the train tracks. Hawkins takes that universal experience and spins it into a suspenseful tale that keeps the reader wondering and turning pages. It's a frighteningly apt portrait of life under the influence of alcohol, with jobs and relationships and facts slipping through the main character's fingers. I could not put this book down. Swift and crafty and insightful, it's a fine suspense novel. Small moments make big scary stories."
"A good read from the first page.  It is a mystery.  It begins with a divorced women, who takes a commuter train to work each day.  The train goes by her former home on the way.  She observes the changes the new wife makes.  At the same time, she uncovers an unusual mystery by observing other couples on the block.  The story is told from each characters' point of view."
"In the mood for a mystery, I dove into this pretty well-reviewed tale. Were it not for wanting to see if the killer was who I thought it was, I finished it. As a mystery, I found it wanting but, worse, as a story, it has an appalling number of shallow and seemingly stupid women. The men don't come off much better. One character, while naïve, was recognizable, even appealing. Another, a practicing alcoholic was so excessive in her commitment to being drunk daily I could just about smell the liquor. A good mystery balances on credibility. I found this had none."
It was a wild ride. It took a while to get into the story. Then I had to keep going to figure out how it was going to end. Crazy.
"I had high hopes for this book, however I was very disappointed with the way characters developed and how some parts of the book that were made to seem important were never brought back up. I would not recommend."
"meh.... I liked it. I liked the writing style - felt it was solid. I didn't like the characters and suspected the killer. I felt the ending was too unavailing. But really, given Rachel's personality, I cannot see the story ending any other way. The story is plot-driven. There is not one likeable character in the book but sometimes that is okay. Sometimes, that's just life. Although, The Girl On the Train was a thrilling read, it had too much hype surrounding it and therefore, the book did not live up to my expectations."
"Great read. It's one of those rare books that creates a hunger to finish it the moment you open it.  You ask Rachel a million times to get up and back on her feet to lose the loser.  Don't worry she pulls through. If you've ever felt the pain of rejection this books invites you to conquer that feeling and remember you were the one that got away. Grab a blanket, a drink and forget the rest of the world as you enter Rachel and Megan's.  Both grappling with the image of the man they thought they knew you too will wonder if you've ever let love blindside you. A++++"
I'm so glad I gave this a try because its one of the best stories I have read in a long time. I read a review that said this is like a grittier version of Gone Girl and I can see the comparison but I think this book is much better. I didn't really like Gone Girl but The Girl on the Train was great. All of the characters are flawed but they feel like people I could know. The characters of Gone Girl just seemed a bit unrealistic to me. I would go into more but I don't want to give too much away. It's a great mystery that I really enjoyed. I didn't want to put it down.
"It remained on the top 10 list so long, I finally got around to reading the book.  Wasn't sure at the beginning if I even liked the book, and then, just like that, I was hooked."
"I'm no book expert by any means, but I enjoy reading the latest craze just like every other 25+ year old girl. This book is insanely good! I have been fairly disappointed in all the other ""craze"" books that have come out recently but this one was so good I couldn't put it down. It's dark, psychologically thrilling and complex. I actually 100% agree that if you liked Gone Girl, you will love this. Be prepared though, once you get into reading it, it's hard to to put down. I found myself up til 3am on a work night because I couldn't put it down. FANTASTIC!"
"I won't give away the plot. Very easy read and next to impossible to put down! The characters, especially female, are reasonably developed and complex. The plot will keep you guessing. The writing isn't fussy. If you haven't read for a while and wanted a good ""starter"" book like I did, this is a wonderful choice. The equivalent of going to a summer blockbuster, it probably won't leave you asking deep questions, but not everything has to. It does what it does brilliantly. Recommended!"
"Over hyped, predictable story line.  Wasted time spent reading it."
"It took a lot to get into this book. I got it on my Kindle, but had to gt the actual book from a friend in order to read it with the constant flipping between characters. I could not keep track of who said/observed what. It got good in the end of the book, but I found it a struggle to read. The funny thing is I picked this book for our book club. The discussion was better than I thought it would be but I cannot say I am a fan of this book. To compare it to Gone Girl is so far off."
The story around the main character is rather despairing at times even though she becomes the heroine in the end. Did not keep the book in my library after reading. Gave it away to the library.
"This book was very similar in style to Gone Girl. It caught my attention from the start and held it through to the end. A very quick rwad. There were no heroes or heroines to speak of. It's hard to 'root' for anyone. All of the main characters are pretty lousy people. That being said, the mystery is well thought out and the end has a nice twist. I would recommend this to any reader who enjoys a good mystery."
"I was looking forward to reading this book because of all the great reviews but what a waste of time. The time jumps/different character chapters are annoying. I never really cared about any of the characters. I figured out who did it early on. The ""train"" doesn't really have anything to with the story either. Trite and typical."
"Suspenseful but not the best writing I've ever read. I found the switch from one character's actions to the other, along with some writing faux pas to be distracting. Near the end, when the tension was building, the main character was described as sitting in an expensive, leather chair she had bought, but soon afterward she was described as being on the sofa. The author went to the trouble of describing the chair, but never mentioned any action saying the character had moved."
"I have been using this pan for almost 3 months and I love it!  I am so glad I purchased it and note I am thinking about the 12"" skillet.  This has been my go to pan for everything.It clans up beautifully.  I've only hand washed. It cooks evenly. I love the purple as it is subtle and pretty.  The glass lid I was impressed with the rose gold colored knob. It's just a well done item and I would Def buy again and recommend."
"I never felt any connection to the characters. What a depressing book. I didn't like the characters. While I think Ms Hawkins did an good job developing them, I never felt sorry for anyone just disgusted  with their weakness and lack of character."
A bit difficult to follow in the beginning. Kept going back to the check dates. Once I understand the style it made sense. Slow in spots but good ending.  Many twists keep the reader engaged. Good book.
"I found the character of Rachel to be quite enjoyable, just because she's so difficult to like. In fact, all the characters in this book are difficult to like. They're all flawed. They all do awful things and are general a-holes. Still, you can't help but look at them and wonder if you see pieces of yourself in them. Have you ever cheated on someone? Been cheated on? Lied? Been a little too violent in an argument with a SO? Drunk-dialed/texted an ex, over and over, or just embarrassed yourself by being able to let go? Made a fool of yourself? Came to work hung over and useless? It's a good read, for sure. I'm sure reviewers like to use words like ""unflinching"" to describe it.I personally just enjoy books with characters that beat back the stereotypes. Rachel totally did that. She's overweight and totally makes a fool of herself repeatedly. You're disgusted by her weakness, and yet if you've ever been in a relationship, especially one that ended poorly, you can probably feel a glimmer of understanding.Hollywood will undoubtedly make this into an unrecognizable mess. But oh well, such is life."
"It took a while to get into the book but the end was fast and full of adrenaline. Awesome story when it came to the intricacies of failed and successful relationships, exploiting the importance of knowing someone before you date or marry them."
"Since the novel was proclaimed as the next Gone Girl, I was eager to get started since I loved that book. Rather than a real psychological thriller, it turned out to be a regular who dun it..not the type of literature that I typically enjoy.Although there was an interesting mix of women, all who were suffering in some way because of motherhood, some of the sections seemed to drag on and on.As the author portrayed the alcoholic binges of the main character, I believe that she wanted us, too, caught in the downward spiral.  That worked the first one of two times around, but then became a drudge to read.If the who dun it genre is your reading style, you will probably enjoy it.  For me, it was just okay."
"Think Gone Girl but not as annoying narrative. I couldn't put it down. You have to pay attention to the chapter titles, and the dates, otherwise you'll end up confused me having to flip back to look at the dates and who was speaking. The end seems kind of rushed and left me kind of like, ""Really? That's it?"" But I guess that's how it goes. All in all, good fast read, good story line. I will definitely recommend it to my friends."
"Taut thriller. Not a wasted word! Like a play with an ensemble cast. Amazingly mesmerizing first person narration with stream-of-consciousness interior monologue, the writing itself is a metaphor for the suffocating neuroses each major character suffers from. Powerful psychodrama that makes you feel their suffering without asking you to forgive or like the characters, but helps you understand how anguish causes us to make bad decisions. This is more than a thriller, this is literature!"
"I expected so much more from this book.. I was highly disappointed. I forced myself to read it only because I paid for it.. it was boring, at times confusing, depressing.. left questions unanswered.. complete waste of time."
"Okay, let me first admit that I am not a fan of 'psychological' novels, and had I known this was one, I wouldn't have bought it.  Nor am I happy with authors who use something like psychology and/or addiction to get the character to do something totally brain-dead.  This author used both.  This is one of those stories that would be an essay if the heroine just used some common sense (just a teeny bit of common sense!) in the first chapter.  In addition, I didn't like a single character in the book and was severely tempted to stop reading it, but I knew I wanted to write a review, so I must read the whole thing.  The character closest to likable was Cathy, who was super-nice and a major enabler of Rachel's psychological and addiction problems--basically a doormat and doing all the wrong things."
I liked the framing of the story in the beginning but by the middle toward the end it's to married to a format that doesn't make since anymore.The finale seems too big of a shift for the antagonist. I was hoping for a better twist but this is my first murder mystery novel. Not sure if this is typical.I wanted to read this before seeing the movie so I have a better base to judge the movie.
"Up until the last 20 - 30 pages, I was all set to give this book 3 stars.  I thought it was well-written and kept my attention, however, I had a very difficult time with Rachel.  I don't have to like characters in a book, but I like to understand why they do the things they do ... so that I can at least have empathy for them if not sympathy.  But, in the end, I not only felt empathy for Rachel ... but sympathy as well ... and found myself really rooting for her.  I figure that's a pretty good book that can change my feelings about a main character so drastically."
"Overall liked the book - but it is not something I would re-visit as (1) There is not too much sub-text or character details that I want to re-visit after the reveal and  **spoilers ahead**(2) though there is some attempt at describing and analyzing issues related to infertility, baby death, alcoholism, the author does not dig too deeply to surface the complexity around them. For e.g. it would have been great to know more about the killer - not the motivation, which was clearly laid out, but just more about the killer's tastes, personality, etc.The multiple narrator touch seems to be a new thing in literature, especially the unreliable-female-narrator. It works for a larger extent, but of course, I can sense the struggle that the author might go through with trying not to reveal too many spoilers.Recommended for its good premise and pace. Made some difficult reading for me as some of the issues mentioned drove home."
I enjoyed continually deciding who was the killer and then changing in my mind again and again.  Important to keep the characters straight as there is constant changing of each character's narration..
"Three unreliable, and unlikable, women narrate this debut thriller that we read for book club - eight women, ages 29 to 40, of various backgrounds read this and sat for discussion.On a whole we found that we couldn't relate to any of the characters, nor did we like them.Rachel mourns the lost of her ex-husband and stalks him by taking a train to No Destination every day so she can drive behind his house (her old house) and pointedly ignores it (?) under the pretense of watching his neighbor a few doors down. The train must only pass these house for a 15 or 30 seconds, but in that time it's enough for alcoholic Rachel to become fixated on the neighbors and invite a romance for them in her head. Ie, they have the perfect life that she never got to have. Rachel is a sad, pathetic drunk with no life focus/ideas/motivation, refuses to get help for the most part, and is most likely mentally disturbed. She's a voyeur, a liar, in denial, delusional, has black outs and is a bad friend and person. Despite everything she goes through, she doesn't learn much and is ultimately given assistance by her mother... telling us that she continues to be a waste of air albeit a sober one.Megan (aka Jess) is somewhat more excusable in her lameness as she suffered some terrible losses in her life. But whatever sympathy you feel for her is absolved as you get to know her. She doesn't take accountability for her life, she lives free and fancy with the only commitment she has being her husband, and she cannot even honor that. Given that she only has one thing in her life to be loyal to and can't manage it, she comes across as another waste. She acts as though sitting all day and being loved and cared for is awful but she doesn't take any steps to change her life.Anna, Rachel’s ex-husband’s wife, has a very small narrative (really Train is mostly Rachel's story with a bit from Megan) is a pointedly unlikable person, who was actually likable to us. Regardless of her shallow perspective on life and her cruel side, we thought she was the most ""real"" and energized of the three women presented. She's someone you can root for, even if she's a bit of a villain. Of the three women she's the only one who seemed to know herself and take control of her life. But even that being said, her voice is the smallest, her window the tiniest, so it didn't improve much of the overall story.There are no twists that felt original in this thriller. The ending was a let-down. There was nothing new or inventive about the way the story unfolded.  The red herrings are annoying instead of clever (the pile of clothes, the pile of clothes, the pile of clothes that went nowhere). It felt so typical and old... but NOT in the good Hitchcock way - which it's been compared to (how? why? how?!). The villain was SO cheesy. The dialogue at the climax felt like a spoof on a thriller instead of a thriller itself. The actions of the characters the entire novel seemed bizarre and illogical. We had a hard time making sense of any of it.. but we also realized we just didn't care either. Everyone was just so unlikable.We always play games at book club - and this one inspired very little gaming. There wasn't really a lot to go on or develop. The activities were pretty blah compared to other books we've read.We rated this one ""best drink coaster"" of Book Club Books 2015. We gave it an extra star for being a moderate page turner and because it was blessedly short/easy. We also compliment the author on an impressive debut, seeing as how it is a debut. The writing itself is good quality for the most part."
"How often do we wish something we imagine is true? And how often do we think we know, but are really imagining something? Here we have three women with each having her own wishes and knowledge. Figuring out what is true and what is only imagined gives us a fascinating study of wishes and lies. Are these women any different from people we know or even ourselves?An interesting read with perhaps lessons to be learned makes this book well worth your time."
"I read this novel strictly based on it's popularity and on the recommendations of friends. It was a fairly good suspense novel but the writing style itself was not something I particularly enjoyed. That, combined with the fact that I solved the mystery about halfway through the novel made for a bit of a tough read. Probably not worth the ten bucks, but if you catch it on sale it reads quickly and is interesting."
"Great read!! I rarely give 5 Stars but this book totally deserves it.I loved the plot; a very sad, lonely, drunk, yet sympathetic woman cannot seem to let her ex husband go and move on with her life. She certainly has reason to be angry with him, he dumped her for another woman, but 2 years later she is still obsessed to the point of losing everyone and everything in her life. At times you really feel for her but other times you just want to shake her and tell her to get over it.One drunken night, while she (Rachel), acts on an impulse and decides to show up at her ex husband's house, she finds herself in the middle out of a missing persons investigation.The story is told alternately between the points of view of Rachel, Anna (former mistress, current wife of Rachel's ex) and Megan (missing women).  As the plot unfolds, we find out more about each woman, their lives, histories and motives. We also realize how little people really know about others and how outside impressions can be very deceiving.While reading this book, I didn't really find myself reflecting on the writing style. To me, that means it was written seamlessly for the story. The book was easy to get hooked on, I couldn't put it down once I got started. The ending was not what I had expected. Although  the 'bad guy' was one of several on my list, I really didn't figure it out until very near the end.I highly recommend reading this book. I'd love to hear others thoughts on it. It would make a great book club read."
"I really liked this book, but I gave it four stars rather than five because I found it difficult to follow. The story is told in the first person, but it is told by  three separate first persons, each telling her own version of various incidents leading up to the climax.  DON'T SKIP OVER THE CHAPTER HEADINGS AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH CHAPTER. These headings clearly identify the narrator of each chapter and the year in which the action took place.  I still managed, now and then  (more than I'd like to admit)  to get confused about who was doing what when, but it is possible that is just senility rearing its ugly head.  Overall, I thought the book was nicely plotted and the characters well defined and mostly sympathetic, despite their flaws. The author kept me engaged throughout, and on the edge of my seat toward the end.  The conclusion was satisfactory and unexpected (by me) and all in all  this was a very good read."
"I wanted to like this book - at its most fundamental level, the story line is a good one and could have been addicting. The problem, as some other reviewers have pointed out, is that there is not one single likable person in this entire novel. I need a character I can latch onto - protagonist, antagonist, hero, or heroine. Yes people are inherently flawed, but the characters in this book are overwhelmingly rotten awful people - all for very different reasons, but still. In the end, I truly did not care what happened to a single one of them and that made this an incredibly difficult book to finish."
"Somewhat predictable, cliched, interesting, and suspenseful at times. Entertaining enough that I finished reading it more quickly than anything in recent past, and even despite the fact that I couldn't relate to any of the main characters in the story.  In the end, I found myself wondering if this will be the first book I've read where the movie was/will be better??  I'm likely outside of the core demo being African American and male, so the fact that I was captive enough to read through quickly says a lot for the work and quality of story telling."
"Read this novel and really wanted to love it but I couldn't. It's full of very flawed characters (as is life I suppose) and it's very hard to root for anyone, especially the protagonist. I find it difficult to read a book and feel satisfied when you aren't rooting for anyone. I won't give away any spoilers and I will acknowledge that Rachel ( the protagonist) has had a hard time but at a certain point, you have to rise above your circumstances or the bad hand you've been dealt (don't you?). I'll be interested to see how the movie unfolds as the book is a narrative from the view point of  3 different women. Can't recommend the book."
"This novel was a page turner for me.  I hated putting it down.  However, none of the characters is likeable and they are all rather depressing.  That doesn't bother me, as I like novels that have interesting character development.  I did think most of the characters and many of the events were unrealistic and over the top, but that is true of many novels. Think of science fiction and fantasy novels, for example.Rachel, the main character was an alcoholic and I kept hoping she would straighten up and quit drinking.  Much of the time I just wanted to shake her for making repeated poor decisions.  Her ex-husband Tom had left her for Anna.  They had a baby, something Rachel had not been able to do.  Anna and Tom seemed to be happy, but then he was cheating with Megan whom he hired to be a babysitter.  The story is told in alternating chapters by these three women.As I said, the novel kept me reading and wanting to know what would happen next.  I kept trying to figure out who was a reliable narrator and who committed the murder.  It was well written too. I guessed who the murderer was after reading about 80% of the book, but I occasionally thought I might be wrong.Even though I liked it a lot, it is not a book that I'm likely to remember a few years from now, perhaps because several of the situations seemed contrived."
"Sometimes a book is enjoyable because the author displays a prowess over the twists and turns of the plot, you keep guessing at whether certain words and phrases are clues. And sometimes the use of language stops you in your tracks, and you read the words over and over, swimming in their meaning.  Or sometimes a book has a message, perhaps about whether what was lost was ever really truly in your grasp.  And sometimes Mr. Magritte, a cigar is really a cigar."
"This books is pretty good-- not amazing. Many others have already given a synopsis, so here are my pros/cons:Pros:-The book is a quick read and is entertaining.- I liked the overall story quite a bit (the writing style was lacking)- I hate when I solve the mystery too early. This one had me guessing for quite some time, and the ending was believable-- accomplishing both of those tasks is rare.Cons:- The writing style. The story is told in first person from 3 different characters, but the style never changed from character to character. They felt one-dimensional and the change in perspective seemed more like a device to tell the story than anything else.- I didn't like any of the characters. This doesn't bother some people, but I like having someone to root for.- While the ending was believable, it felt rushed. Once you figure out what happened, you get about 10-15 pages of resolution.I'd recommend this book as a fun, (relatively) cheap read. Not a must-read by any means, but I enjoyed the book."
"I liked the basic plot of the book, eventhough the main character is very unlikable (in my opinion) and the entire book is written through her POV. The authors writing is descriptive and quite enjoyable, but there is a stretch in the middle of the book where I found the the scenes monotonous and quite repetitive at times. I recommend reading this if you are looking for a different kind of book a thriller, no romance, no happy ending involved."
"With all the hype, I was disappointed with the book.  I expected it to be more suspenseful. After a while, I was anxious to be finished with it.  I don't feel it was all that well written.  It certainly didn't flow well."
"I thought this was a good book in the end. Not to give anything away, the main character's alcoholism really drove me batty in the first half of the  book , so much so I questioned finishing the book. I completely understand alcoholism is a serious issue and I'm not trying to say it is not but I really got annoyed reading about the character's benders she went on. The last half of the book was pretty good. Overall I was happy I read the book ."
Unsympathetic main character. Awful attempt at a twist without any clever or interesting misleads. Do not believe any review that compares this to Gone Girl. Although I was desperate for the main girl in the book to be gone.
"I read a news paper review that suggested this book was comparable in some ways to Gone Girl. Baloney;  it should not be mentioned in the same paragraph.  Bottom line - kept wanting to quit before the end, but, like a looky-loo, I decided to see this train wreck to the end.  Sorry I ever started it."
"Unlikely heroine!  The story lines of the women revealed their disturbing imperfections as human beings.  Yet,  somehow, they each triumph!  Mystery unfolds without revealing the resolution"
"The book starts a little bit boring but the more you read the more you get entangled with the different characters. I like the fact that you have the story told by each character, making the plot more and more interesting. I simply can not give this book five stars because sometimes it becomes boring and the pace too slow, also the characters are without emotion, but altogether a nice book easy to read."
"Generally I read male authors, but this is the second book by a female author that I have thoroughly enjoyed. The first being Gone Girl and now, The Girl on the Train. The authors depiction of the alcoholic Rachel was especially compelling. The story line was interesting and it grabbed your attention immediately and the writer let the tension build to the exciting climax. The character development of the three main female characters was very good and their different story lines made the story even more compelling. It's a hard book to put down."
"I was shocked when I saw how many reviews this book had AND a 4.5 star rating--didn't bother reading the synopsis and just purchased it (surely that many ppl had to be onto something). When they say a book is so good you can't put it down, this exemplifies that. I finished it within days bc I was reading every free second I had. Now my bad is set so high and I'm afraid it'll be awhile before I find something that even comes close, they're usually far and few in between."
"I generally adore books of this nature. Conflict between husband and wife is a fun read for me.  We have drunken Rachel, whose self esteem is battered. Hard to route for her but it says something about the author to get the reader involved enough to be frustrated with a character. The book was an easy read and made me look forward to finishing it. Would not have guessed the ending and who had dealt the sad end to adulterer Megan. Nevertheless I felt dissatisfied with the ending and felt it should have had a somewhat stronger conclusion."
"Am almost finished with this book which I can only put down for a minute.  Love the style of writing. I have had to go over some of it again as I always have the NEED to never miss anything and in this book I don't want to miss anything.  I reread one of the character's dialogues because I was not clear on some things. But that is OK. This is the beauty of the story, a real mystery.  I had a hunch and think it may be true. Can't wait to finish but then what will I read???"
"Starts quizzically and a bit slow - where are we going and why?  I like the way the reader is drawn in to each character's strangenessThe motion of the train is like the motion of the plot and the movement of the characters in and out of each other's lives.  I wanted tosay ""Don't,  please don't, don't be a fool,"" as Hawkins advanced the action.  I knew who should be guilty of murder, but I wondered ateach police blunder if the ""baddie"" would be discovered and if pain would be assuaged.  You will find this novel worthwhile."
"Great book, I wasn't sure what was going to happen until the end!  It takes place in modern times, so it should be girl on the tube, or metro or subway.  Rachel is a drunk and screw up, imagining the lives of other people she sees from her seat on the train.  She pushes herself to become part of the lives of the people she sees and, well it's a mystery so I don't want to say more!  If you've been to a therapist you'll recognize what your therapist tells you when you've behaved badly.  Anyhow, super book, I'm sure it'll  be a movie."
"I usually read thrillers , suspense, fast-paced who done-it's. Even though this was different somehow, it was still a great read. A page-turner. Love the style this book was written. Anxiously look forward to the next!"
"Quick read because you get sucked into the story right off the bat.  It drags a bit and gets a little tiresome with  each of Rachel's struggles to regain her memories from many a drunken stupor.  I understand that's what the author may have been going for in portraying the struggle of an alcoholic with little hope in her life, but it felt tedious in the way of story development.That said, you really felt for Rachel as her life seemed to fall more and more to pieces and really wanted to find out what happened on that fateful night!"
"The story is told thru the thoughts of three women who have a common denominator of living on one street in a suburb of London. A commuter train runs in the back of the homes on the street. One woman watches the back yards of the houses as she rides the train and dreams stories of the residents that live in the homes.  Two remaining women who live in these houses next to the train tracks live their own lives within their own fantasies.The story is one of the most compelling I have read since "" Big Little Lies"" which is told in a similar fashion."
"Each character was developed very well. The beginning was actually very slow for me, but it didn't take long for it to grab my interest and hold onto it for the rest of the book.  The writer framed the whodunnit aspect to where you never figured it out until the end of the book. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys suspenseful books and movies."
"This a great fast paced book. It kept me intrigued, excited, and guessing the entire time. I loved the characters, especially because they weren't made out to be heroes. You can really hate the characters, have a good reason to and respect that choice/them. It's just a great book and I suggest reading it before looking up on IMDb who will play what role. I can't wait to see this movie but I'm so glad I read it before. So will you <f0><U+009F><U+00A4><U+0093>"
"Absolutely riveting.  Could not put it down.Having just returned from Paris where I was ""the woman on the train"" I found the story plausible and quite engaging, as well as entertaining.Lovely, engaging characters coupled with the authors fluid writing made this something I couldn't stop reading until I was finished with the book!!"
"I loved The Girl on the Train and wasn't able to put it down-- I read it in just a couple days! I can't remember the last time I read a book that quickly. Hawkins' writing style was fluid and easy to follow, and I never felt bored by the book or like it was a chore to read it. Quite the contrary, I was engrossed by the story, felt empathy for the protagonist, and relished the mystery within the pages. Highly recommend!"
Surprised this is a bestseller. Suppose that's the power of marketing. Poor writing and even weaker plot. Nothing to get excited about as the main character bumbles her way through her clumsy story.
"I was hesitant to read this book because everyone compared it to ""Gone Girl"".  I happened to hate that book.  I finally gave in, and I enjoyed it.  I loved the character development, and at some points I couldn't stop reading! I probably would've rated it five stars, but I think the ending could've been a little better. Overall, I enjoyed it and would recommend it to others."
"People aren't who you think they are. Rachel is drowning in alcohol and regret over her failed marriage. You can't help but feel sorry for her and at the same time you want to shake her and say ""stop being so weak!"" this book jumps forward and back in time so pay attention to the dates.  A page turner, but it's no ""Gone Girl""...it has a better ending"
Chiefly because of the alternating persons format and partly due to back and forth time switches the book was a little hard to follow when you read as I do...a chapter here; a few pages there. But overall I found it an engaging read.  As a recovering alcoholic myself I found it interesting that several of the characters showed strong signs of the disease.
"Very good book, that Tom sure knew how to make everything her fault. She tried to help Scott but that didn't help and he went crazy on her,  the wife finally did help, just all going on. I thought it was the wife that killed Megan at first because Tom was seeing Megan. Poor Megan after her experience with her first baby, now more grown up I think she would have kept the baby, she didn't want to get rid of it, but he was so mean to her!!!! At the end something about a warning, book #2?"
"I was disappointed in the ending. It was rather predictable; nothing extraordinary.  Prior to the conclusion/climax, I found the book suspenseful and I kept turning the pages.  The author's writing style is very different.  I was confused for the first 70 pages or so because I didn't know which character was speaking!(I have already read reviews of the movie coming out in October and, as usual, it is not the same as the book. It even introduces characters who were not in the book!)"
"Gripping story of three women, forever tied together. The story told by each of them. A page turner.... Twist and turns at every bend while telling the story as sounds of the train on the tracks... click clack...."
"I really enjoyed reading this book, I can say that probably is one of the best books I've read so far, I don't want to write any spoilers, so just keeping it simple, I will say that it had a great pace, well built  characters, the story will definitely keep you hooked the entire time, and you just need to get to the bottom of everything. I gave it the highest rating, because lets face it, the book was so freakishly awesome. I wouldn't change anything, it's a masterpiece. I totally recommend it to any avid reader who enjoys a thriller book, with some romance, suspense, and complicated situations. Thanks to the author, I look forward to read some more of her work."
"I got this book based on so many people raving about it. I am 17% into it and the best part of the book?It puts me to sleep. I'm sorry--I could not get into this book. Could not relate. Had no idea what was going on. Delusional, selfish, self absorbed. Whatever. Did not like her. Did not care. I hate when that happens. I have to disconnect and not proceed. If anyone wants me to send it to you, let me know. I'm happy to loan it out. Give it away whatever.Good luck!"
"The book was recommended to me by a respected friend.I feel I should have downloaded the sample first.I found the author's style to be repetitious and confusing as the principle in the book started off by deceitful behaviour in order to conceal that she no longer was employed, but continued to a daily routine involving the train to and from her point of previous employment.She then continued her downward spiral through a series of actions involving what amounted to voyeurism, then alcohol dependency, to infidelity and finally involvement in a murder.This is not the kind of book that I would endorse."
"2.5 stars. The women in the book--Anna, Megan and Rachel--are not likable. I did not feel drawn in to find out what happened next. The premise was okay in that someone riding a train daily past the same houses might make up some story about the people living there to while away their daily commute. However, the interconnections of implausibly self-absorbed, ill or evil people just did not appeal to me. Nor did the author's technique of switching voices between the women and moving about the timeline of their parts. I am guessing that was to add suspense but it just annoyed me and I found myself caring so little about trying to figure out which month, year and person was talking that I skipped to the end. I was hoping that the ending might change my overall opinion...but I was wrong. Yes, it was dark and suspenseful at times but not something I will recommend."
Amazing book. As usual much better than the movie.. Lol..  Everyone always says that but that's because the book can have more in it. The movies need to fit the man story points into an allotted time period. I read on my kindle paper white some nights until I couldn't hold my eyes open. Definitely recommend even if you have already seen the movie. So much was not in it... And the book is set in London. Hope you enjoy it! <f0><U+009F><U+00A4><U+0093><f0><U+009F><U+0093><U+0096><f0><U+009F><U+0093><U+009A>
"The Girl on the Train:  A Novel is written in an intriguing, suspenseful manner.  It is only in the last few pages does it become evident where the story is going.  For a quick, entertaining read..this is the book."
"Hawkins starts off developing a decent character in Rachel but then starts employing a few too many tricks such as telling the story from the perspective of three different women while using flashbacks and morning evening timestamps.  It's true that she lets you know when and where the characters are but it makes the book a little confusing.  ""Girl on a Train"" is worth reading because Hawkins can write but it's certainly not a classic."
"The story was exciting and suspenseful and a very good read. However, it was slow in the beginning, almost boring. But,you could tell it was leading you somewhere, and it made you want to continue reading. The last few chapters became suspenseful and exciting with somewhat of a surprise ending. I enjoyed the book and would recommend for others to read it."
"I did not care for the characters, or for the story itself.Tedious and depressing.I would not recommend this book."
"I started this book twice. The first time I just could not get into it. The main character was so depressing. But I tried again and eventually the story got better and better. The characters became much more involved and there were some comical moments that made me laugh. Anyway, I did really enjoy the book and was intrigued with the plot and characters. I had to finish. Really good first novel for the author. I gave it a four star because the beginning was difficult and slow."
"This book was very thought provoking. I did it in a book club and it did not disappoint.  The struggle between mental abuse, addiction and memory loss made for great thoughts to ponder.  We all watch people around us, does that make us crazy?  People may recall details of a situation differently. But when someone goes missing everything/ everyone is called into question."
"This was supposed to be a book with some dynamism, some action.  What a joke.  We have a self absorbed drunk women stumbling into a pit of despair.  Well get over yourself, dammit.  I want my eight dollars back Amazon."
"It starts a bit slow but works up to a boil, a good story, well written. This will make a great movie."
"Thanks to Paula Hawkins, I don't have to pace waiting for Gillian Flynn's next novel. ""The Girl on the Train"" is a splendid, psychological mystery thriller that keeps you wondering not only ""who dun it"" but also ""what is real"". We really seem to be witnessing a renaissance of women noir writers and I couldn't be happier.I picked this up on a whim, none of my friends have read it. But they soon will be. A fine addition to anyone's library of suspense. Hawkins is a real talent. Can't wait to see what's next."
"The Girl on the Train was one of the most engaging mystery/suspense novels I've read  in a long time.  I found myself reading for long periods of time just trying to find out what was going on and who the perpetrator was.  The plot and characters were interesting, realistic and complicated', not to mention fascinating.  This was a great read!"
A good read. The only real problem I had was my losing who or which of the main characters I was following; who was who. The main character's to easily roll'd one to another and  I found myself having to recheck chapter titles to see which of the women it was I was reading? The visual and clear differences between the women in the over-all plot will make it a good movie.
Took awhile to get into and somewhat confusing.  Hard to believe it could actually be a thriller promised by promo's on TV.  I did suspect the correct killer prior to the ending but found it interesting reading.
"I decided to purchase the book due to all the hype and I like to read a book before I see the movie based on it. I rarely write a review, but for this one I am. I was disappointed. I am a huge fan of mystery and suspense but this book let me down. It was an easy read, but to me was boring. I put it down several times but came back because I had paid for it and thinking that maybe it would get better. There was no stand out character or dialogue."
So many people recommended this book to me so I bought it.  The book starts out a little slow but I kept with it. One of my problems was that I could not connect with the main character.  She was just too psycho for me to sympathize with.  The plot also was sort of slow and not particularly suspenseful or that interesting as you never really get too attached to the victim either.  If you like to read - read this anyway since lots of your friends will have read it as well.  Not a complete waste of time but there are so many better books.
"I bought this after hearing and reading great reviews.  I, unlike many reviewing, did not expect the next great American novel or an Agatha Christie  level writing....just wanted a quick ""get away"" type of read.  That is what I received;  A quick escape type fun read.While I would not necessarily have paid full price I'd I had known how it would read,  it is definitely worth a library check out."
It certainly kept me on the edge of my seat and guessing about the outcome. My biggest problem with the book was a lack of empathy with the major character in the story. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery.
"Interesting , and poignantly true about the lifestyle of people with alcoholic tendencies. Kept you guessing till the last few chapters witha range of scenario's developing throughout the story."
"This is not a book for men. No man wants to identify with being oppressive or bullying. Yet, this claustrophobic, little story, despite the troubled and conniving women in it, turns on the duplicitous and untrustworthy nature of its men. Men fabricated by a woman to demonstrate her disdain for them. It smothered me. And it made me wonder how it could be a best seller for so long. It must be that the women readers identified with the author's mentality. I couldn't. I don't feel drawn to a victim mentality. It's just drama for the sake of drama."
"The audible book is excellently performed.  The story itself gets long due to the obsessive nature of the characters and being locked up in each of their thoughts. It builds suspense well if you stick with the story.  It gave away the climax a little early and the end wasn't as believable as I think it could have been.  The characters should have stayed a little more to form.  Again, the reader on the audible book made the book better!"
"...were not my book group's chosen novel this month.  It's a good Page Turner but has too many unreliable narrators.  Also I found the time line annoying. One narrator's  time line was not chronological with the others. I had to keep flipping back to pay attention to the dates. Also too many obsessed female victims, for my taste in this day and age. But maybe that is who I would recommend it too, women who are codependent, but it could harm their psyches also. For mystery fans it's a very good ""Who Done It?"""
"Rachel is a black-out alcoholic who has lost her husband, her home, her looks, and her job. Her sanity is hanging on by a thread.  Keeping up the facade of a daily commute so her roommate won't know about the job loss, she takes the train into London every day, just as she always has. Through the course of the daily commute, she notices a beautiful young couple who live along the route, and makes assumptions about their life - everything from their names to their occupations, personalities, and romantic life. One evening, though, the woman who Rachel has been observing turns up missing. Rachel was in the neighborhood that evening, and has come home bruised and bloody, with no recollection of what's transpired. She involves herself in attempting to place together the events of that night while struggling to return to sobriety.This was a gripping story. I found myself unable to put the book down. Paula Hawkins has done a wonderful job of creating characters who the reader may not necessarily like, but who's stories draw us in. The mystery is well kept up until the last few chapters, though it does conclude with plenty of questions still unanswered. I agree with the others who compare it to Gone Girl - this is very much in the same spirit, with contemptible characters leading sordid lives and no truly happy ending to be found. I really enjoyed this one!"
"I had a gut feeling to stop reading about 20% through and wished I'd listened to it. The time on the NYT Best Sellers list encouraged me to keep reading. The book was formulaic, the characters one-dimensional and the ""twist"" laughable. I recommend passing on this one."
"The hardest part about reading this book is that not one of the characters are easy to like.  They are all very flawed human beings.  It's a good page turner, suspenseful and wrapped up well at the end."
"Fine writing in a cleverly developed plot with good characterisation. Having travelled those London train lines daily, I could just see the houses and little fenced gardens running down to the tracks. The only flaw was the scarcely credible rapprochment between Rachel and Anna as the climax approaches, and Rachel's impossible physical recovery from a major assault, to turn the tables on the murderer."
"I has to read this book twice to understand why it disturbed me so much. No clues were given until the very end of the book as to who tricked who. I told my friends not to read it because it showed the protagonist as a pathetic, deplorable, useless alcoholic with no redeeming characteristics. At the end I felt like I'd been socked in the stomach. It made me feel sooo deceived. But, I have to see the movie to see how the characters are portrayed."
"I think the device of moving dates around and repeating scenes from different characters points of view us what kept me from giving up on the story.  I have since seen the movie, and found it a weak not very engaging plot.  The talent performances were good, but I never really found myself pulling for the protagonist.  I worked my way to the end, but alas, it was a bit of a disappointment."
"While this was an entertaining read, but it was too much of a ""wanna-be"" to Gillian Flynn's Gone girl.  With the way the format was set up using different perspectives and a dated timeline, I was expecting a little bit better of a twist that was harder to see coming.  I also thought the characters were so cliche in their gender roles.  Very unrealistic portrayal of relationships between spouses which basically painted women in a very unfavorable light almost the entire book."
Very predictable. Tried to like it and hoped I was wrong as I had it figured out by about a quarter of the way through. Extremely disappointed to find that reading all the way to the end netted me nothing except confirmation of my theory. I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read it; astute readers will be able to put two and two together and figure it out like I did prior to the end and will probably be disappointed with it like I was.
"I tried to read ""Gone Girl"" 3 times and never got past the 2nd chapter. I kept falling asleep. I watched the movie, and other then Rosemund Pike playing a psychopath amazingly, it sucked also. A friend recommended this book as the remedy. It reminds me of something one would watch on the ID Channel so it was realistic to and I couldn't put it down. I read it in 3 evenings. I did feel that Rachel's whining was redundant, but understandable as she's an alcoholic. Overall, I totally recommend this book. It was a real page turner."
"Suspense lurks just down the street and across town!  ""The Girl on a Train"" allows a view into worlds unknown and yet known; the character's lives are twined together in ways unknown to each other until the final pages play out."
"This book was ok. The blackouts of the main character seem a stretch, especially toward the end of the book. While I like the premise of the story unfolding through different character voices, the development of each character is shallow. You know each of the characters has demeaning, undesirable qualities, but they are just blah and predictable. The only nice character, Cathy, comes across as a doormat.As the book progresses, it becomes very predictable, which is disappointing. Without divulging too much information about specific characters, I felt at loose ends wondering what happened with some of the remaining characters. The ending was somewhat abrupt, almost as if the author had reached her quoto of pages and decided to call it quits before tying up the loose ends.I did see some style, plot, and character similarities  between this author and Gillian Flynn, however, Flynn's writing is more developed. I wouldnt say the book was a total wash, but I fail to understand the rave reviews."
"There wasn't one thing I liked about this book. All of the characters were cliche and unlikeable. The plot was not Hitchcockian, it was predicaable and tired. This could have been easily written as a short story.  I thought this book was a total waste of my time and energy. I have never been so anxious to finish a book. I read at a very rapid pace, but I found myself at warp speed just to start another book. Why would anyone want to make this into a movie?"
"What a bunch of weird, horrible characters that made for a thoroughly entertaining read.This book was recommended to me by someone who said that the three female characters were so stupid that you would want to reach through your kindle and shake them, to which I thought ""well it must be well written if you care that much."" And so it was!A well written, strange story about unlikable people. Yet it was crafted so well that I couldn't put it down and was glad I didn't... though I had predicted the ending correctly."
I had to pay full  Amazon price for this as the movie version is about to be shown. Therefore I was going to be fastidious in my critique. But there was nothing to be critical of; the book is excellent. I will say that I had about run  out of empathy for the continued self inflicted problems of Rachel but even that was solved at story's end. Truly excellent!
"It took me a little while to 'get into' the book but something about it kept pulling me back after I put it down.  I usually don't care much for stories that bounce back and forth between characters, but there's something about this one that kept me hooked.  I wanted to know more about the characters and where their stories were going.  I also found it a bit disturbing; perhaps because it shows the darkness that hides in all of us everyday people  but I would definitely recommend it to another reader."
"Much like ""Gone Girl"", this novel features unreliable narrators, a murder with the standard 'the husband must have done it"" attitude, and unexpected twists and turns.  It also plays with the notion that each spectator of the same event can walk away with a completely different 'vision' of what actually occurred, and what we think we know about relationships from brief glimpses of someone's lives may not live up to what we have created them to be in our imagination. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It was a quick and satisfying read!"
"Although I enjoyed the book, all the characters were basically nut jobs.  Of course, the main character, Rachel, speaks though an alcoholic haze, her story is at times irritating, suspenseful, and self indulgent.  the other characters don't impress me as being much different although sober.  It's a chilling book in many ways, but I can't quite give it 4 stars."
"I've heard a lot of people say that they love this book, so I thought I'd give it a try. I didn't think the description on the dust jacket was a very accurate description... the main character is too drunk too often to be likable, and her obsessions are more annoying than thought provoking.I did not find any of the characters likable, largely because it seems the author focuses more on what the characters do rather than on who they are. That's a fine line to walk, and I don't think Ms. Hawkins walked it well."
"My goodness. I'm so sad it's over. I hate when amazing books end. This is one  of those stories where you don't even care how it ends, because you want it to go on forever. I love and care about the characters. I can relate to them all. They are all so deep, so real, so flawed. The story comes from so many perspectives you feel so truly involved. It becomes your story too. I'm so glad I was told to read this book. Oh will pass on the recommendation."
Some of the characters are well developed but not all the meaningful leading characters traits are revealed. One tends to get a bit impatient with a character like Rachel who seems to repeat the same mistakes rather a lot for a woman of her age. There is a good presentation of suspense throughout much of the story.The story is interesting but not riveting.
"I had purchased this over a year ago and somehow did not read it.  Often with multiple characters narrated I find it difficult to keep them straight.  This was not the case.  Each character was strong and memorable.  The suspense was there until the very end and all the loose ends were tied in.  Loved it, hated for it to end and now I want to see the movie."
"This was a really good book especially if you loved books by Gillian Flynn. Although, this story did not have as much of a twist as Gone Girl, it did make me think several possibilities until the very end. It also gave me a very creepy feeling towards the end of the story. I am sad it is over, I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good suspense!"
"Although it was a bit difficult for me to get into the book at first due to the three different voices, and the lack of time to devote to it, I was finally hooked on the story once I was about 50% through it. The story was well told and the characters haunting.  A good mystery. I recommend not starting to read this book until you have time to read to the halfway point in order to keep up with the switching between the three voices.  I will be interested in seeing this as a movie."
Very good book! A good fast pace read. Some what similar to Gone Girl in writing style. Very dysfunctional cast of characters. The main character is a complete mess but love or lack of love will do that to you. The suspense will keep you wanting to know what happens next and who is doing what. Very very very highly recommend this book. Haven't seen the movie yet and hope the movie is just as good as the book.
"When I started this book, I was excited by the main characters and the first person accounts of events. I love that the main character was an alcoholic and not your typical heroine. However, the last quarter of the book was so disjointed and incongruous from the first 3/4 of the book, including a complete overhaul of Rachel, the alcoholic, that it felt like an incomplete, cheap and rushed version of the first part of the book. Promising beginning, disappointing ending."
"This book is one of the brilliant ones to come along in a long time. The book is based on a quite uncommon setting and draws in the attention of the reader gradually as one delves in and observes the themes through the eyes of the different protagonists. The characters are complex yet quite well-developed. The author keeps us guessing all the time and is quite adept at that. The pace is quite fast and never allows one to become bored in spite of the simplistic scenarios portrayed. The twists presented are top-notch and one of the best that I can remember to have read in a novel in a long time. I can never imagine how one may dislike this novel.Pros: 1) Brilliantly written in terms of character development, plot advancement and literary contribution2) One of the best twists in novels in terms of unpredictability3) A unique perspective in switching through the eyes of the different protagonists for the same incidentCons: Really cannot mention anythingThe fact that this novel is a debut of Paula makes it all the more brilliant. I sincerely hope to read more from her. I wish she had started writing earlier, shifting from her journalism career."
"Meet Rachel.  She's broken, down on her luck, and living in a lost past she has repainted as perfect.  She drinks to forget as she rides the train and imagines that she is part of the idyllic lives of the people she sees from the window seat.  As the novel progresses, you cheer for her as you watch her slowly remember and regain her inner strength.  Does she hold the key to solving the mystery surrounding Megan's disappearance?While I found the first few chapters of this book slow, the last half of the book is almost impossible to put down.  So, don't give up on it too soon.  Many modern mysteries are simply formula stories where the end is easily predicted. If you love a good mystery that keeps you guessing, I highly recommend The Girl on the Train."
"I loved this book, the changing narrators really give a fully filled out story that you can't put down.  Rachel, the main character is someone you can sympathize with even as she does self destructive actions.  Meagan is the mystery even to herself - she gets bored easily and is very restless, but she also loves her husband and her life.  Finally Anna, the other woman made wife, wanting the perfect life, but it is never quite there.  These three women tells us their stories and little by little we find out how much they intertwine."
"The story is ok in a twisty / turning kind of way.  Since the reader jumps between 3 characters POV, we sometimes see the same event multiple times, from different perspectives.  I didn't have a problem with the story, which is a very convoluted "" who dunnit,"" with an incredibly dull and predictable ending.  Rather I found the characters flat and underdeveloped.  There are three voices, and they all sound exactly the same.  But for Ms. Hawkins telling you what character is narrating, you'd never know which woman is which.  The three narrators are given slightly unique traits: one's a drinker, the other has a baby and the last one is missing.  The audio book was superior because three women narrated so they had actual unique voices, which helped differentiate the otherwise similar characters.I wouldn't recommend the book, but if you need something to while away a short plane ride, it isn't terrible."
A steady read that was full and twists and unexpected turns. The main character Rachael was a complete psychological mess. Most of the other characters were not far behind with their problems. A story about total breakdown of trust in relationships. Trust No-one.
"Book that came from seller was in great condition. Only giving 4 stars because the book itself drags on. I lost interest 3/4 through and still haven't picked it up again to find out how it ends, even though the book has been sitting on my nightstand for 2 months!"
I found The Girl On The Train to be shallow and depressing.  I did not think the character development was adequate to make the characters believable.  It is not the kind of book I enjoy.  It lacked depth.
This is a spellbinding novel. At times you are twisted in the confusion of an alcoholic mind. At other times you see with the clarity of a clairvoyant. The resolution leaves you feeling relieved and healed.
"Really good, but massive trigger warnings for intimate partner violence/domestic abuse and a few other things that are spoiler-ish. Basically the brilliance of the of this story and its darkness is not in the fantastical but in the mundanity -- the worst things that happen to Rachel and Megan and Anna are things women suffer regularly. That is terrifying indeed. I read this in one sitting and couldn't sleep afterward. It's a must-read if you can handle the subject matter but word of advise -- don't read this alone in a dark house. Learn from my mistake."
"I really enjoyed this book. The narrator is totally unreliable which keeps you guessing and trying to figure out her real story.  You know the whole time you're reading it that there must be something more to what you know so far.  Keep reading, it's a good one!"
"Keep me reading, great twist, hard to put down. At some spots, it was difficult to remember which I was character I was reading about. She paints good pictures for the reader. Will definitely check out her other works."
"I have never gone back to read this entire book, as I could not understand the beginning and my attention was lost on this one.  I heard later the story is a horror story and I do not enjoy those types of books.  I did not get that information from the book's description and wish they had made that clear.  I doubt I will ever read the entire book nor will I look to find any further books by Paula Hawkins."
I read this for a book club and it was good. It wasn't great because the beginning was slow moving and I had a few moments where I thought I wouldn't make it. But it picked up midway and I thoroughly enjoyed the book after that! I guessed some things right and a few took me by surprise! Which is good for me because I usually figure things out. I would recommend this book. Going to see the movie this week with my book club girls!
"This is an excellent thriller that has some relevance to our age of Trump.  Not only does it distract one from the bad news on-line and on TV, but it gives one excellent experience in searching for the murderer who turns out to be a pathological liar.  If you can identify the liar, you have found the killer.  ---  While I don't often opt for best sellers, this is certainly one that appears to be worth the read.  I haven't seen the movie yet, but can't imagine that it will be as successful as the book."
"I'm not a dark, moody, suspense, gothic-ish kind of reader, so this book was not up my alley.  I hated that you keep flipping back and forth in the timeline (I mean really, is anyone going to sit there and look at the date and memorize and remember that 20 pages later?).  I hated that the main character is a complete drunk and remembers nothing...ALL.THE.TIME.  Several times I wanted to stop reading or just plain yell at the main character to stop being such an idiot.  This book is centered around 3 woman's voices: a drunk, a whore, and a dumb whore (in my opinion), which made me feel vapid and stupid for picking the thing up.  I'm not going to deny that it keeps you on the edge of your seat (you have to kind of read almost 15%-25% of the book to get to that point), but I felt like I was reading a depressing trashy novel that left me feeling like I wasted my time and money.  Sorry."
"Disappointed with this book. I was hoping it would be a cheesy summer reading along the lines of Gone Girl (light and intriguing), but it was instead repetitive and not at all shocking. Characters were unlikeable, shallow, and underdeveloped. I kept thinking the ending would provide a worthy conclusion to the slow paced story, but it was so uninspiring. Hopefully the movie is better, but unless it changes the story significantly, I highly doubt it will be."
"This book started out a little slow for me. I kept reading and it picked up and picked up some more and then I started to feel like I was on the train! It was such a great book and every chapter I was glued to the book. This is actually one of the few stories I could read over and over again. I read it about a year ago and now they have a movie coming out for it. It'll be hard to make a movie as awesome as this book, but I am so glad I read it!"
"I think my high hopes for this book are the reason I wasn't a huge fan. The blurbs and reviews compare The Girl on the Train to Gone Girl and talk about the unreliable narration and surprise ending, so I was really coming up with some wild scenarios in my head. Instead, the ending was predictable and I guessed it easily.It started off fantastic. The reader gets the point of view from three characters: the main character, Rachel; Anna, the woman who stole Rachel's husband; and Megan, the focus of the crime. It was awesome getting different POV and, honestly, the more the book progressed the more I hated everyone.The book was ripe with adultery, lies and alcoholism. The ""unreliable narration"" was certainly dead-on due to Hawkins making me consider everyone as a suspect from either their inner monologue or the way they acted around others, treated others or were thought of by others. I was absorbed in their lives and how everything connected.I was pretty pissed at Rachel throughout, but I also deeply pitied her. She was a horrible alcoholic who stalked her ex-husband and his new family. She--almost creepily--made up a whole life for a couple she watched daily on her train ride (it's one thing to just make up a story; it's another to build on the story and believe the attributes you created are true). She was someone you wouldn't befriend and, if you were friends with her, you'd sever the friendship the first change you had. But, she had reasons for her drinking and actions that I could understand. I still wished she'd found better avenues to deal with her pain but I sympathized with her the more I learned.I went through the same roller coaster of emotions with Anna and Megan. Anna I felt bad for because her husband's ex-wife was constantly coming around, two years after their divorce, but Anna was the cause of their divorce (or at least the final reason for Tom to sign the papers), so I also felt a bit like it was karma. Megan I couldn't figure out, then I was pissed at her, then she reveals something huge and I felt so, so bad for her and couldn't even imagine what I'd have done in her shoes.Hawkins was great at confusing my feelings and keeping me on edge to find out how it would end. Then, the ending came and it was lackluster. Yes, revelations happened and I suppose the very end could have come as a surprise, but the ""who-done-it"" was almost obvious. It could be Hawkins gave a little too much away in hints towards the end; it could be my expectations were set too high; or it could be that the ending was similar to many other books and I was expecting/hoping for something more jaw-dropping and original. Whatever the reason, I wasn't impressed.I still recommend the book--the writing is fantastic and Hawkins created complex characters who were completely flushed out. Just, if you've read Gone Girl, don't expect an ending in any way similar to that. Otherwise, I think you'll enjoy the read."
"But I can't say that I loved it. To me, the sign of a really good book is the sense of loss you feel when you're through reading it. Your longing to keep reading about the lives and adventures of its characters. I just didn't feel that when I finished the book."
I could not put it down. I liked the back and forth between characters and time periods.  I tried unsuccessfully to try and solve the mystery . I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a suspenseful thriller read!
"This was a quick and interesting read. I'm looking forward to seeing the movie adaptation. I enjoyed the different point of views, and concise writing style. I would recommend for anyone seeking a short dark thriller."
"This was a book I could not put down.That being said, in some ways, many ways in fact, it reminded me too much of Gone Girl.Perhaps this is the London version of Gone Girl.Girl on the Train is fast-paced, riveting and engrossing.I could not feel any sympathy for any of the characters. Rachel was a victim of her own habits, clumsy, dull, needy and relentlessly foolish in her behavior. I simply wanted to shake her and tell her to leave well enough alone, but then of course there would be no story, no conflict.Anna and Megan were shallow, greedy and wanting and taking what wasn't rightfully theirs to take. Megan's wanton nature did her in. Hers was a sad little life that might have turned out better if she had made better choices.Anna's life was a full circle, ""what goes around comes around"" tale.And the men were despicable brutish abusers!Seldom have I disliked so many characters in a novel!I did enjoy the book, but compared to Gone Girl it was a bit disappointing. It was written in the same style.. First one character's narrative, then another's, but the adversaries in Gone Girl were clearly more clever,  more attractive and even more resourceful.Though there were twists and turns, Girl on the Train was plodding in places and I really don't care what Rachel does next!"
"Have you ever found yourself passing by the same houses while traveling to and from a regular destination? Have you ever wondered who lived there, what they do and what happens beyond those curtained windows? Doubtless you would give it much thought once you passed by, but... what if you took that curiosity further?? Paula Hawkins' debut novel, The Girl on the Train, takes you down that rabbit hole.  It's filled with perfect combination of intrigue, dysfunction, deception, desperation, and just the right amount of blood from of unknown origin.  TGOTT was a novel I couldn't put down and hampered my ability to get forty winks.  If you're looking for that rare book that keeps you wanting more, I highly recommend that you get your hands on a copy of, The Girl on the Train."
An intriguing read. I would recommend it to a friend. I was able to accurately predict the ending fairly early on which was annoying because I kept thinking there would be a surprise ending. Still it kept me interested and I'm hard to entertain.
"I tried so hard to like this story and stick it out, because I hate to give up on a book. Rachel, Anna, Jess/ Megan, Scott and whoever else ( ex hubby) were just so unlikeable. I couldn't identify with any of them because the protagonist was....well a train wreck from the beginning to end, and as far as I was concerned never got back on track. I understand being in love and having ones heart broken and everything else she was going through was awful, but it was really hard to identify with her on any level, because I didn't like her, and I tried. I didn't like her roommate either, who pops up a lot in the story. Towards the end when the truth came out it could've been exhilarating because I wasn't really expecting that, but personally I was just glad this train had pulled into the station and I could step off! Felt like all these characters should of been tied to the railway tracks,  Not much to say, it was a page turner, but only because I wanted to get to the end as fast as I could !"
"I quick mystery read that I found enjoyable.  I can't tell you how I know but the alcoholic proclivities of the the main character, while frustrating, struck me as entirely typical.  The same goes for all her crazy actions that cause both the other characters and the reader to groan in disbelief.  I loved the details of London area train commuting.  Because they moved the action to New York for the movie I refuse to go see it."
"Quite an intriguing story, kept me interested till the end -I can't say I liked any of the women, they were weak and could not face reality!  I really like to have a heroine when I read a book - none qualified in this story!"
"This book is a page turner! I found myself having to put it down to get some sleep. Really interesting story. I liked the way Paula Hawkins kept the suspense going right up to the very end. Just when you thought you knew who the killer was, she changed the direction of the story. The characters were well developed. Everyone was connected in some way which heightened the intrigue. Great ending too."
"A complex plot with carefully drawn characters. The denouement was a little surprising but quite satisfying to read. The book could have been a bit shorter -- after the plot is fully articulated and the characters well developed, another go 'round with both characters and plot seemed unnecessary. Still, the thought of skipping some pages did not occur to me. My wife and I have been on the train to London a few times, and the view from the train as described by the author brought back happy memories for both of us. Altogether a fun read."
"I have to tell you, when I started reading this book, the only thing I could keep thinking was how this will be a terrible read for me ... the absolute desperation of depressed, alcoholic Rachel makes you want to cry for her and do whatever you can to actively not become her. She passes her husband and his new wife's street each day and has a glimpse of another couple's home, who she aptly names ""Jess and Jason,""  Jess and Jason are perfect, until Jess goes missing and Rachel slowly comes to realize that they weren't perfect at all.The book is definitely a suspense/thriller type, but it also has elements of despair and drama that those who don't normally love thrillers can get on board with.  It just takes such sharp turns and all of the sudden you're like, ""How did I not see that before?""The characters are utterly unlikeable, but that was part of the charm of the book ... aside from Rachel, who mostly grows on you, Anna is close to sociopathic in her utter desperation to be a trophy wife and perfectly judgmental mother, and Megan was also mentally unstable in her own right, but not nearly as bad as Anna.  The whole book leaves you baffled at the end, and kind of wishing it had been longer and more drawn out.  Overall, I highly recommend.  It's ""Gone Girl"" with more characters and a slightly more watery plot."
"Why oh why is this book on the best sellers list? Because of people like me who think the book will be good? It was compared to ""Gone girl"". Not so much. No twists in plot line. No characters that I remotely liked. I almost stopped reading the book a dozen times but kept thinking that it would get better because of the great reviews. Well I wasted my time. Very predictable, very boring. I am happy to be done with it."
"The Girl on the Train is a verywell-written, captivating novel. However, after reading some reviews online I was expecting more. The mystery/suspense part of it is very good, and keeps you reading the book nonstop. But most of it is just the whining of a number of women who feel unsatisfied and doubtful, and clearly showing that men are the cause of their misery. Too much victimizing women within the book, showing men as the bad guys who cause all of their suffering."
"When I bought and read this book I didn't realise it was the sensation of the year. It was better that way because I did not expect much and was not dissappointed. The idea of writing about a girl travelling daily on a train and imagining the lives of those she sees from the window is good. I did't know at the time it was autobiographical, as well as the heroine's struggle against alcoholism. Those are the best parts of the book, and the introspective parts are by far the best part of the book. The suspense/mystery part is not as good. I already suspected the end half way through the book and keep reading just for confirmation. I can't say it's a bad book, but I don't understand its cult status. Some people compare it to Lost Girl, and although the plot has nothing to do with it, I understand the comparison. There is something dark and aimless about both of them, and the anti-heroes portrayed as the main characters in both books are similar. So if you really, really liked gone girl, chances are that you will like this very much."
"The characters were very unlikeable. The story lines were boring. The women were boring, unintelligent, and submissive. The men were domineering and violent towards the women. I chugged through the book for my book club."
"I was very engaged in reading The Girl On the Train!  It drew me in immediately through its tone and setting. I wanted to find out more about this girl on the train. What did she see? Why was she on the train?  The tone was mysterious and I wanted to know why!I was drawn to Rachel's pain. I couldn't imagine why she sought such relief through her drinking. What kind of pain drove her to seek out oblivion.  The description of her drinking was well done.  Her pain is palpable, you can almost taste her drinks and you can almost feel her hangovers.A painful tale of hurt and deception and ultimately triumph I believe.There was unfinished ideas that kept me from five stars. It left some significant holes that needed closure."
This book held my attention from the beginning with the premise of the passengers on a train witnessing lives of people who become victims of crime and psychological terror. Excellent suspenseful read.
"The stylistic writing riveted while introducing us to the deep point of view of the flawed protagonist and building to a satisfying climax. This unique take on a whodunit mystery was fresh and anything but cliche! At times I loathed the drunken Rachel, but Hawkins made her so three-dimensional that I usually understood her motivations and could even sympathize with her decline and admire her very human tenacity."
"The writing here is fine, but the story is poorly conceived and told.  The three lead women are all one-dimensional and tell their parts of the story in the same voice.  Aside from the chapter titles which tell you who is telling each section the story, the reader isn't able to differentiate the characters by the way they speak or act.  The story is repetitive and introduces a number of red herrings to try and heighten the suspense.  The author chooses to introduce plot points 3/4 of the way through the book in order to move the story along.  There is nothing that leads up to these revelations.  They could have easily been discovered 1/4 of the way through the book, which makes everything in between seem like inconsequential fluff.  There are other things that really annoyed me with the storytelling, specific to the person who committed the crime, but I won't reveal any spoilers here.I give it 2 stars overall, but I can understand why some people enjoy it.  I just had too many pet peeves with the storytelling to rate it any higher."
"If you would like to read a story about vapid characters who are self absorbed and justify all their actions where even the ""hero"" is so unlikeable go ahead and buy this book. I was interested when ads for the movie were released and as I read it I kept hoping for something redeeming to be revealed and it never came. I read one review that said ""you don't have to like the character to care about that character"". Um... yes you do!"
"The screenplay extracted the essential elements from the book, but reading the book after I saw the movie revealed the characters' depths and complexities in a way that synergistically made them both better. This was an outstanding first novel. My only criticism was that the author didn't develop the psychological profiles of the characters fully, and this is what the story is really about, not the action."
"Having heard the movie was out soon, I wanted to read the book first.  It took a while for me to enjoy reading it but finally the story took hold of my interest.  I feel it went on too long when describing Rachel's issue with alcohol - too many repeat descriptions. At times some chapters rambled on where it could have ended more quickly. I did manage to figure out the ending three quarters the way through. After reading the book, I now wished I had waited to see the movie first."
"It was interesting... It certainly gave insight into depression, addiction, illicit love affairs and deception in marriage.  The end was a little weak..... And rather predictable by mid way through the book.Having said that, it was interesting to read how the ""girl"" could make up entire lives for people that she just passed by for a few minutes each day, and you came away thinking that she really needed to get a life of her own!  I hope that she eventually did."
"I was captured by the syntax of Paula Hawkins.I found the first person pov from all the characters interesting and compelling.There were no heroes to love and lots of villains to hate.  First book I've ever read with unlikable  characters,yet, the story drags you in, forces you to see life through each characters eyes. We all know people like these. Good read."
"I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this book. It's an easy read when you don't want a 800 page, heavy read. It kept my interest throughout, although I was a little disappointed in the ending but over all I definitely recommend Girl on the Train."
Chapters titled with characters names seemed to jump all around.  I found it a little difficult to keep up with thestoryline if I put it down for a bit and then went back to reading.  Who is the character now?
"Poor alcoholic Rachel.  As she commutes daily on a train, heading towards a job she longer has, passing the same scenes daily, she creates a world of her own.  She fills it with characters that she assigns the perfect life, the perfect love.  Filling worthless, filled with longing for her ex husband and jealousy for his current wife and their new baby, she's witness to a murder.  Of course she's viewed with doubt.  After all she's an unreliable drunk who suffers blackouts and is obssessed with her ex husband's life. She sounds crazy and is viewed as such.  Twists and turns.  Some surprises.  I began to suspect who the murderer was half way through the book.  Still a good read that I kept going back to.  I felt real sorrow for Rachel.  Unable to move forward with her life, unable to admit that her past life is over, unable to decipher what memory is real and what is blurred by wine.  First time I have read htis aurthur.  I would read her again. Her characters are believable and I wanted to find out what happens to them"
"I don't think I'm a good person to comment on this book since I have 2 brothers that are alcoholic, so I was very frustrated with the lead being in a haze much of the time.  My friends and fellow book-club friends loved the book, as well as the movie.  Having had a brother die from alcoholism, I got angry at the deceipt of the lead character, even though their was definitely enough room for some pity.  It is a quick read."
"Warning: This is not a happy book. It takes place in a suburb of London and is full of broken people living broken lives. However, how these broken people are revealed and how they all relate to a murder is what makes the book interesting. The mystery is told from three different women’s points of view, each telling their story in the first person. It can get little confusing, especially when they jumble time periods, but you slowly learn the whole story by listening to each one. I was intrigued in the first third, bored somewhat by Rachel’s interminable alcohol black-outs in the middle, but then was gripped through the final third as the full truth began to be revealed. It has almost no action (until the end) and is mostly a lot of sad people talking about their sad lives, but the way the author broke up this murder mystery made it interesting. Kind of how I feel about the romance in the movie “500 Days of Summer” where the story is pretty simple but the reveal is the fascinating part. So I enjoyed it, but don’t read it if you need a lift of your spirits! 3-1/2 stars out of 5."
"The book overall failed keep me interested - I had to force myself to finish it.  The main character was a bit too pathetic for my taste, and I found myself getting increasingly irritated with her actions."
"I enjoy a good mystery and I was provided with one.  Tom's motives were a little weak.  I suspect that he was a more complicated character than the author revealed.  The women were universally weaker than I wanted them to be.  What happened to the red-haired man?  Rachel's turning away from alcohol so suddenly is questionable.  Despite all of this, the plot made the book a worthy page-Turner."
"The story is set in England and involves 2 married couples, who live on the same street, and the ex-wife of one of the husbands.  She is the ""Girl on the Train"".  The ex now lives north of London, which has her commuting into the city via train.  As it happens, the tracks run right behind the houses where the couples live (and where the ex used to live).  The ""Girl"" rides past the houses every morning and evening, and she can observe some of the activities at the various houses, as she is able to see into the windows and backyards.All of the characters have issues; the ex is still not over her failed marriage and she had, and still has, problems with alcohol.  This causes others to dismiss her observations and input.Suspense builds and then one of the wives is found dead.  Most of the main characters could have been responsible, as well as some minor characters who are introduced along the way.The story is told from the first-person viewpoint of the 3 women and it toggles back and forth, which seems to be the current style.I found the story unique, engaging, and suspenseful and I felt the ending was not predictable."
"My choice of reading this book wasn't really mine at all, it was the agreed upon book for our book club, and I had not actually heard much about it before I bought a copy. Since reading it, I have read some of the reviews and find it fascinating how much effort is put into comparing this to ""Gone Girl.""  I liked both novels but did not love either, however, I see the connection a bit, although in the end, not enough to think it has any importance.I like that this book started out vague, with our only information coming as the thoughts of a woman, only during her twice daily train. Rides. Her thoughts were vague and murky and we didn't have a clue what any of her references were about, but as she was an alcoholic, who lied to herself, suffered blackouts, and spun fantasies about people she glimpsed from the train, that feeling of cloudy, unreliable thinking was strangely real. Rachel felt very real, especially as she made promises to herself to change, and failed to keep those promises.  She was very human. Not your best choice of friend perhaps, but someone people could love, and someone who inspired loyalty I friends, at least for awhile.The next voices added in more details, and other layers of lies and deceptions and failure to make correct assumptions. The pacing quickened and the details began to merge and by the end of the novel, I couldn't stop reading. I think the story was told in a very unique way, and the whole slow build up was enjoyable. I didn't like the ending, it felt rushed and forced, where the rest of the book felt very possible, it almost felt too contrived to believe.Still, was it worth the time and money I spent to read it? I think so. Will I remember having read it? Maybe not if there wasn't a movie to look forward too, but it was good enough that I will look for the movie."
"A very dark story  -- you'll read it quickly. The red herrings keep you guessing (and worrying) until the end. You don't know if you'll ever know what really happened until the very end. You do get answers and come to understand the characters. If you've ever wondered if you are alcohol dependent, this book might get you to sober up! The characters are well written and you learn about them because of what they do -- not because the author says this one is selfish or this one is generous."
"The first half of The Girl on the Train was great. The characters were believable and their intersecting narratives helped to drive the novel forward. However, about half-way through the book, just about everything falls apart. The characters start engaging in activities that are contrived and clearly not believable.  (Is it even remotely believable that the main character would have sex with one of the other main characters?  (Note: I'm being intentionally cryptic to avoid spoilers)).  At that point, the narrative becomes strained and intentionally drawn out.  Finally, it is a well-known device of poorly written mysteries for the killer to ""tell all"" near the end of the novel.  The best mysteries lay out all of the pieces of evidence as they proceed and there's no need for the killer to engage in revelations at the end of the book because everything has already been laid out.  I raced through the last third of this book simply because I wanted to be finished and move on to something more rewarding."
"I needed a book to read on a 5 hour plane ride and a friend recommended this book. I knew nothing about it when I downloaded it other than it was a murder mystery concerning a girl who rides trains and sees something. Sorry to say after reading it, I was not impressed. First off, none of the characters are even likeable and are all a bunch of low-life's, especially the protagonist. Now I know, we're supposed to feel bad for Rachel because her husband dumped her and she's an alcoholic. But Rachel is so stupid, so totally void of any type of basic common sense, that I just couldn't stand her and I almost quit half-way through. But I pressed on. Then I get to the end and this lying, stalking, repulsive anti-hero who pees in her pants, pukes on her roommate's carpet and falls down in public all the sudden figures it all out and becomes the voice of reason?? Secondly, I hate the amnesia plot ploy. It's been done countless times and I think it's lazy. Yeah, I know, the alcoholic black out thing is supposed to be a new twist on it, but I'm not buying it. Hitchcockian?? Absolutely not. Next time I have a long plane ride I'll stick to the tried and true masters, Agatha Christie, PD James, etc."
"I can't say the ending was a surprise, I had come to the conclusion that would be the final outcome.This book was easy to read, a little odd that it was ""first person"" by the main characters.  Once I got all of them straight, I started over and it was a good read.  The last few chapters were hard to put down.Over all, I really enjoyed this story.  The struggles of all of the characters were believable."
"I haven't read a book since high school and even then I just used SparkNotes. I picked this book up and couldn't put it down. (What a cliche thing to say... Whatever. Like obviously I put it down to like eat and go to the bathroom and have a life and stuff but you all know what I mean.) Anyway, I suddenly just got really into reading, which is an awesome feeling that I've never experienced before, and I have this fantastic book to thank for that! :)"
"Rachel is a mess. Her husband Tom has dumped her, she is drinking – a lot – and she has lost her job. Embarrassed to admit to her landlady/friend that she is unemployed, she continues to ride the train into London each day and entertains herself by maintaining a fantasy that the husband still loves her and that the attractive couple she watches in their garden visible from the rail car are living the perfect life. She is the primary narrator in this cleverly written psychological mystery. The second narrator is Tom’s new wife Anna who is frustrated with Rachel’s late phone calls and occasional appearances at their door. She is convinced that Rachel intends to do her new baby harm. The final narrator is the woman in the attractive couple Rachel watches daily. She has a deep secret in her past, has lost her job at an art gallery, and is bored and restless in her new marriage. Suddenly, she disappears. Author Hawkins flips from narrator to narrator to very gradually reveal what has happened to Megan along with the culprit and the cause. Very absorbing story and very frustrating as well because Rachel makes such poor decisions and is such an unreliable narrator. Well done!"
"Usually I don't pay much attention to comparisons of books on Amazon- this one was compared to ""Gone Girl"". But as things sometime work out, I had ""Gone Girl"" on my Netflix list and it came two days ago, and I watched it while reading ""The Girl on The Train."" No, not both at the same time, but during the same time period, yesterday and today. It couldn't have worked out better because these two stories are similar- but different.""Girl On The Train"" started out slowly, and by page 80 I still hadn't become engaged in the story. I even thought about giving up and reading it some other time. But then slowly the story started to pick and soon I got to the ""can't put it down"" stage. First I got disgusted with Rachel, the ex-wife, with her drinking, stalking and mooning over her ex husband. Then I decided I didn't care for Anna, the woman who replaced her. The third woman was Megan, who had my pity. The strands of the story began to intertwine and became a swing back and forth-- who's the good woman and who's the bad? All of them? None of them? The ending came as something of a surprise-- at least for me. I'm so glad I kept on reading because this story did have all the suspense of ""Gone Girl"" so the comparison fits. Good plot when it finally got rolling, good story."
"Oa never ending self loathing heroin, who drinks excessly drinks and has occasional blackouts. The story fixates on this, and other unsavory characters. There is a back story of a mystery, but one that is less and less as the story drags on.  If you like self loathing character living badly, this is your story. I, for one, am sorry to have spent the price to buys this over hyped book."
"This book was pretty predictable, and honestly, I didn't really get the point of the confrontation between the husband of the woman and Rachel.  It never seemed like we got a resolution as to why he was so angry with her to the point of trapping her.  The ending was pretty blah, and I feel like this was just a great value brand of Gone Girl, which was pretty popular."
"Definitely a page turner. I initially received mixed reviews from friends saying it was ""trying"" to be Gone Girl, but I disagree fully. I can see some similarities here and there, but nothing substantial. It is an easy read and keeps you guessing. The author repeats a lot of words and actions that the different characters make and I can't help wondering if it is simply because she likes using them or if there is a deeper meaning for why she chose those words. For example, the word ""cathartic"" is used quite a bit and also the action of a male character rubbing the cheekbone of a female character happens a number of times as well.I also found it interesting how the ""likability"" of every character continued to change drastically. Each character has moments where you believe he or she is ""good"" then moments where you think, ""oh, this is the bad character."" I continued to find myself trying to figure out who I was ""supposed"" to like or dislike, when really, each main character is flawed and has a past, which makes it very realistic and more gripping to try to discern who committed the crime."
"With all the hype 'The Girl on the Train' had been getting, I wasn't quite sure if it would be something I'd enjoy. Generally I tend to steer away from huge blockbuster books as they are a little more ""safe"" than what I usually enjoy reading. Lucky for me, I decided to see what all the fuss was about, and was sucked into this book from the very beginning. One of the best ""page-turner"" thrillers I've read in quite some time, 'The Girl on the Train' is a fantastic psychological work. Not only a thrilling read, but also a smart one that makes you question how much you might really know about someone - even after you think you know it all."
"Having read Gone Girl and hearing the hype for this book, I expected more than was delivered.  I thought that the plot was over-complicated; it was difficult to distinguish characters and motivations because, especially at the beginning, the reader had to decipher ""who was who.""  I never was able to sympathize or identify with any of the characters.  They were all significantly flawed; I could not understand the motivation of any of the three women--they each found a way to manufacture their own dismal destiny without finding a way out of the mess.  They each allowed themselves to be manipulated by the males in the story; are women really as desperate as this??I also thought that the plot was bogged down by repetitive reflections.  How many times can we go to the ""underpass"" without becoming suspect of the events?  Once it was established that Anna was not available in the scene, the predictability of  the final event was obvious.I kept wanting at least one of the characters to be redeemable . . . someone whom I could feel controlled his/her own outcome.  But, not one really stepped up to the plate.  Circumstance ruled each one; human will did not stand a chance."
"I was a little slow on the uptake realizing there were three different characters telling their stories. Once I got a clue I followed the story line better. The three stories are dated on each of their chapters, but unless you are compulsive about noting the dates, it's a little hard to follow where you are in the action in terms of the time line. Ultimately it comes together and the time line becomes less important.Altogether though, I think it was a well constructed story, interesting to follow. The most interesting character was struggling with alcoholism and I believe the portrayal by the author was very on target and fascinating to follow.Aspects of it make it not-such-an-easy read, but it certainly makes you think, and that's ok too.Generally well done - I would read another by this author."
I read this book because I saw the movie was coming out and I would always rather see the movie AFTER reading a book if the book is good. I heard many good things about the book so I bought it. It did not disappoint. I have read other suspense novels that were better by the way the author introduced the characters and developed them I would have to peek back and see which person I was reading about sometimes. Worth the read!
"I really liked this book.  I read mystery/suspense almost exclusively and must say that I was happily fooled several times, guessing at the killer's identity.  The protagonist, Rachel, is an abjectly pitiful specimen.  A self-loathing alcoholic, she seeks to hide from her housemate that she is no longer employed by getting on the commuter train each morning and evening.  But she chooses the same train that takes her right past her old home, which her ex-husband now shares with his new wife and baby.  But Rachel has another motive besides reminding herself of all that she has lost.  She watches another young couple, giving them names and fantasizing about their lives, notably how perfect and perfectly in love they are.  The shock of learning how utterly different people and circumstances really are than the way they appear is the vehicle for Rachel to question her assumptions about her own past and present.Yes, there are reaches, demands that we suspend, if not belief, common sense, but this is hardly a new demand from writers.As far as the ""Gone Girl"" comparisons go, I'll just say that this is the second book I've read since ""Gone Girl"" that uses the rotating narration of some main characters.  I'm not tired of it yet, but I could feel differently if it is more than a temporary literary fad."
"I thought the book was great. It wasn't what I was expecting at all, but it was good. It was a bit difficult at first to get into the writing style, but after 20 pages or so, it was easier to read. I was able to read it pretty quickly. At some point, I had a hard time putting it down. I love books that are suspenseful and the plot has some surprises. I would definitely recommend this!"
"I had intense high hopes going into this book, but it does take some time to pick up speed. I feel like they could of developed the characters equally as well in 50 pages and not 100. The ending is great, but I feel like the majority of the book was drawn out. Dont get me wrong, I read the book in 2 days (and I'm not a reader at all) so I really enjoyed it, it was an easy and fun read. And the ending caught me (a little) by surprise."
"While I did finish ""The Girl on the Train,"" it was far too long. Many of the sections narrated by Rachel were repetitious and could have been eliminated. But i did find the character of Rachel to be a compelling one, the other female protagonists less so. I am not of the opinion that characters have to be likeable in order for me to enjoy the book. Had it been slightly shorter it would have been more enjoyable."
"What's with the ""GIRL"" books? Dragon Tattoos...Gone, etc. This book is just a rehash of Gone Girl, with two people telling their stories. I read it all and it was interesting, but not best seller material in my opinion. And this is all reviews are..an opinion. Would I recommend it to a friend? Sure, why not? A good read. To suggest an exceptional read, however, I would recommend The Circle, by Dave Eggers."
"www.melissa413readsalot.blogspot.comWhere do I even begin about this book! I loved it of course as I have rated it 5 stars. This was a complex journey through the lives of people that seem so normal from the outside. But things are never what they seem.THERE WILL BE SOME SPOILERS AFTER THIS POINT!!!The book is told through three different lives: Rachel, Megan and Anna. Rachel seems to be the alcoholic loser that can't get over her husband Tom leaving her. I feel very sorry for Rachel. All she wanted was to have a child with her husband. Because she wasn't able to conceive she went into a deep depression which turned her into an alcoholic. Her husband Tom was an a..hole who wouldn't help her in any way. He could have tried all kinds of counseling with her, but he leaves her. Of course this doesn't help with her drinking. She is just a sad person living with a woman named Cathy and trying to get by. She just can't cope over not having a child and losing her husband. It's been two years and she's just lost and drinking so much that she loses her job. But instead of telling Cathy this, she still rides the train every morning and evening, pretending she still has a job. This train just happens to go by her old house and she watches her ex husband with his new wife and baby. She also watches another couple a few houses down. She makes up names for them and dreams of their perfect life. It's a little bizarre, but so is life.The name of the couple in the house down from Rachel's old house is Megan and Scott. They are not the happy couple Rachel dreams they are. Megan is not happy with Scott and is having an affair. Scott is a bit of a control freak and scary.Rachel is always calling her ex trying to get him to come back to her. She shows up at their house sometimes. Just crazy things she does when she is drunk. One night she goes out there to see him but is so drunk she can't remember much of anything that happened. She knows she finds her way home with blood on her and that a man helped her up when she fell to the ground. She finds out the next day that Megan is missing. This takes us on a wild ride of Rachel trying to find out what happened to Megan. She was there that night where Megan was last seen. She wonders if she did something to her or if she saw someone that did. She blacked out and can't remember much at all.Rachel gets caught up in trying to find out this mystery. She stops calling and bothering her ex husband Tom as much since she's got something else to worry about. This makes Anna, Tom's wife, happier but she still has stress and hatred for Rachel.I have to say I didn't like Anna at all through the whole book! I thought she was a horrible person. When finding out she was having an affair with Rachel's husband the whole time just confirmed it. Then she eventually marries him. But not all is wonderful in this little world of people.Rachel befriends Megan's husband Scott trying to find out what is going on and help him with his pain. She told him Megan was seeing another man, her therapist. She's trying to keep the police from thinking he did it.The whole book has you wondering if Rachel might have killed Megan thinking she was Anna since they look similar in appearance. But then things start to fall into place and it's a dramatic ending that I didn't see coming. I loved the ending. I just loved it. Justice was done for all involved, in a sense.I loved this book and I hope to read more from this author. She did an awesome job!"
"The time-shifting and narrator changes were confusing at the beginning, but became easier to handle after the first few times.  By changing the narrators, particularly Rachel who may or may not reliable, the book creates tension and mystery.  About three quarters of the way in, I had a suspicion how it was going to resolve, but the execution was still interesting, as the motivations of the third (?) narrator are more difficult to discern."
"This book was really amazing I wanted to see it before the movie came out an honestly  didn't know that much about it just that it had a good  rating. It was truly a page turner with many unforseen twists an turns. It's  not one of the super morbid books either that will leave you awake at night wanting to erase what you have read from your memory, just enough suspense to keep you reading an on the edge of your seat."
"The Girl on the Train belongs to the category of trashy mega-bestsellers of the Gone Girl caliber. The “girls” in both titles are my age but the titles are not imprecise. These are not Bildungsromane. The adult protagonists live the results of the female development that pursues infantilization. The three female narrators of The Girl on the Train are not just infantilized. They are infants. These women refuse to reach at least the toddler stage and learn to form and retain memories. Their helplessness and neediness can only be compared to that of an infant. And the symbolic mother from whom they demand constant nourishment and comfort is, obviously, a man.Men are needed to mother the infant-women but, at the same time, they are an object of intense rage and resentment if they fail to bring the nourishing tit to the screaming infant-wife the second she demands it. The men are all-powerful, mysterious forces who sometimes choose to torture the infants by keeping the crucial tit away. This process could not be more similar to the psychoanalytic description of the relationship between an infant and his mother’s breast. And, of course, the consequences of the breast staying away for too long are the predictable oral-stage traumas.As trashy and devoid of any artistic merit as they are, these bestsellers are an important cultural phenomenon. The moribund Gender Studies programs could be reinvigorated if they started with a course on what actual women actually read, talk and care about so massively. There is absolutely nothing in today’s gender theory that would even remotely try to address the issues that preoccupy women today. Feminist theory (theory, not practice) has grown completely irrelevant to the majority of women. These bestsellers that I keep reading – in spite of their long-windedness, poor quality, and extraordinary repetitiveness – are enormously more valuable than the mountains of recent publications on gender that I study for work.I can’t give The Girl on the Train more than 3 stars because the author is inexperienced, clumsy, and drags things out like’s she’s paid by the word. There is definite value in the book as a cultural phenomenon, however."
"It's uncommon to associate the word beautiful with a thriller but that's the fitting description for this book. Every character has a story that's carefully crafted and wound together, the suspense is nail-bitingly built up; not stretched unnecessarily or over dramatised. Every scene can be vividly imagined. The end is predictable after a certain point, but sends a chill down your spine nevertheless. Definitely worth a read!"
"So, it took me a long time to get into this book.  I found the main characters so flawed they were almost unrelatable, and it's hard to get engaged in a story where the main characters are just that unlikable.  BUT, the story had a really good last third.  It as thought-provoking in a much as when you hear from various characters' first-person narrative, you certainly appreciate how ""point of view"" is everything, and you can become sympathetic to even flawed characters."
"A really great mystery story.  Similar to Gone Girl but with a few new twists.  I  reminded me of some horror  movies where you want to stand up and scream, ""don't open that door"".  Many times throughout the plot her main character puts herself in situations that make you think, ""oh no, please don't go ahead with that line of thinking"". The author clearly allows you to experience the depression and futile feelings of her main character. It is very well written and above all entertaining."
"Difficult story line. Very hard to follow. Extremely slow in developing plot. I did not understand what all the hoopla was all about over this book. It was a waste of time and money as far as I wam concerned. I read a great many books, but this is not one of my favorites, nor is it one I would recommend to anyone else to read. A real disappointment!,!!!"
"short sentences to create tension do not work for me.  it was not my cup of tea.  i nearly always complete a book no matter it's rating but i did not want to return to it.  I read Goldfinch in a day or two, but this took time.  i like lots of styles & genres so i was surprised that something this popular would not peak my attention."
"I enjoyed reading the book from three character points of view, so you are able to get a better understanding the certain events from several perspectives. After a while, one of the characters became pathetic due to the drinking. The movie and the book were pretty similar for the most part. I read the book first, then saw the movie."
I read into the 2nd chapter and just couldn't get any further.  Very unusual for me as it is extremely rare for me to give up on a book but I just wan not enjoying it.  I had been anticipating reading it from all the hype I had heard about it so was disappointed to find myself struggling to develop any interest or enjoyment in the story.
"At first, I was frustrated by the main character. She is sort of a pathetic character who makes lots of bad decisions. I have a hard time wanting to continue reading when the main character is so frustrating. But I stuck with it. The way the mystery unfolded was intriguing, with a side of annoyance with the behavior of the main character.  The writing is clear and very effective, technically well crafted."
"This book was a thriller! It kept me on my toes the entire book. The woman in the book, Rachel goes through a depressing stage were she drinks and has extreme anxiety. This book is worth reading it tells the struggle of a troubled woman which I think a lot of women can relate too. The shipping on this book was amazing; it came in just two days. I was able to buy this product during a promotion offer. I am happy to share my experience reading it."
"I liked it that Ms. Hawkins was able to pace the novel in the same way that the Train in the title moved - starting fast, slowing down along the way, but then picking up speed.  The middle of the novel was incredibly slow for me, but it accelerated in the end.  I also understand why all the main women characters were somewhat similar and all the main men characters were similar - kept us guessing who the killer was, but I kept getting them mixed up, especially since the points of view changed with each chapter."
"I usually don't read fiction but I'm so glad I grabbed this book. Intricate lives of characters, the plot that grabs you right away made this book hard to put down. Surprise followed by a surprise written in a credible way. I got transported into England and was taking trains with Rachel, followed the narratives of Anna and Megan. This book is easy to follow, hard to put down."
"I though this was OK but not up to all the hype the book's received. It's not another Gone Girl, to which it's often compared and which I believe had more twists and better developed characters. But the concept was fascinating, as anyone who's ever looked out a train window and wondered about the lives of people living in houses near the tracks can appreciate. But I guessed the ""surprise"" about midway through, and I felt the story did drag in places. Nonetheless, it's a good beach read for this summer!"
"Starts off slow and depressing.  Almost put it down, but it was a book club book so I couldn't!  And I'm glad I didn't.  All of a sudden the story picks up speed and what's going on under the surface - what's really going on - starts to emerge slowly and then it's a page turner.  It's an engaging look into the psyche of physically and mentally abused women from the victim's perspective.  If you've been there, it's chilling.  If you haven't, it's instructive."
"Definitely recommending this to all my friends! This mystery novel set in a London suburb is one of those can't put it down, must know what happens next, kind of thrillers. The characters are extremely complex and multi-dimensional. Throughout the book I felt very empathetic, angry, frustrated, scared; all signs of a well written book. I'll be a little more alert the next time I ride a train."
"I really enjoyed this book. I know a lot of people in the reading community have said that they don't like the character development, but I didn't have a problem with it. I don't really think the goal in this story was ever to like the characters, maybe just to sympathize with them. I read it pretty fast and was eager to get to the end. The concept was very intriguing and I would/ have recommended it to many people already."
"At first, it started to be dull, a lady riding back and forth on a train to a ""would-be job""; and later with too many characters to straighten out.  I thought about giving up on reading it until I talked with my daughter who had read it, and she encouraged me to continue.  Wow, I am glad I did as it was one of t he most interesting books I've read in a long time.  The story began to make sense , the characters cleared up and the story had the right ending.  Virginia"
I read a couple reviews about the movie that just came out and it seemed like the majority of the reviewers enjoyed the movie based on the fact that it followed this novel so closely. I figured I might as well read the book. I finished it in exactly 24 hours.It didn't see the ending coming until almost the very end. Loved it!
For half the book I had it all wrong and it was right in front of my face. But by the middle it was quite easy to figure out who did it. Getting to the truth was the hard part. Just as a murder investigation.I enjoyed the book. It was very well written with an impressive chronological order. The author was brilliant. I do think if you like the style of Gone Girl but less gore you will enjoy this read.
"I wasn't impressed. Had I known the main character was a ragging alcolic,  I wouldn't have wasted my money.  ""Woes me"" doesn't cut it for me. So many other great mystery / thriller authors out there."
"Fans of Gone Girl will undoubtedly be drawn to The Girl on the Train, and for good reason. Told from the perspective of three different narrators, this novel is a fast-paced, heart-pounding ride that you don't want to end. Do yourself a favor, don't try to figure it out and unravel the who, the whats, the whys, or the hows. Just let it unfold in front of you."
The older I get the more difficult it is to find something that holds my interest .  A psychological love triangle that goes beyond what is happening into why it is happening.  Lots of  twists and turns that you  see coming but are still startled and shocked when it happens.  Spending time inside the minds of the main characters you begin to see parts of yourself...and may even gain some insight into how you have gotten to where you are in life.  Good old fashioned read.
"Trash. When the perpetrator performs a confessional soliloquy with 10 minutes left in the book, you realize that the writer was stumped as to how to resolve any mystery that may have remained at that point and took the easy way out. There is no literary merit to the novel whatsoever. In spite of this, the book moves quickly and manages to evoke a mild guilty engagement (hey - it IS a murder story), which is apparently the inspiration for most of the positive reviews. Hitchcock?! Are you kidding? If there's a crime and a window...?"
"Alternatively attention grabbing, and irritating,  I got the impression that the author, having started the ball rolling, didn't know how to stop it.  Long before the end I could see where the story was headed.  I am aware that this novel has apparently had very good reviews; I found it interesting in some respects, as in the slide into alcoholism, but overall I rate it as just OK."
"At the beginning, I was a little confused by the narrative switching between characters.  Once I became used to the format, I was riveted by this story and couldn't wait to see what the next chapter or train ride would bring.  If you haven't read this book yet, pay attention to dates as well as which character is telling the story so you can see the big picture of this drama playing out.  I loved how my feelings toward the characters kept changing as the author revealed more about them. I would give this one a big thumbs up!"
This book hooked me and kept me reading until the very end. I finished it in just a couple days which is no easy feat for me considering I work full time and am a month away from my wedding (so busy!). I highly recommend this book and I would recommend reading it before you watch the movie because the book is so much deeper. Such a good read.
"A nail bitter that makes you want to stay up all night to finish.  I loved the shifting character perspectives.  It helped to maintain the suspense, while slowly revealing bits of info that constantly made you question your assumptions about the characters.  I found the characters to be real and compelling, especially the protagonist, Rachel.  Definitely a good read."
"Like reviews say, the character are unlikeable. But that did not make me dislike the book, it was very good. Not great, but a cut above mediocre. the best part for me, what makes it 3 stars over 2 is two things:1.  the story changes perspective among three female characters, and you learn a little more and a little more about what is going on from each2. the time frame jumps back and forth, future/past/future/past and that was cool, made it more interestingWithout the above it would have been just so-so."
"I couldn't put this book down. People are comparing this book to Gone Girl and it is very intriguing but a very different story. Lots of suspense. You do need to be careful to remember which woman is talking in each chapter. I read almost a whole chapter thinking it was Rachel when it really was Megan. So I had to go back and reread knowing that. At times it does get a bit confusing, but worth it. It's a 'guess who did what' story and kept me flying through the pages. Movie rights have already been bought and I can't wait to see it now."
Edge of your seat suspense  and great plot twists!! Would definite recommend to anyone looking for an easy read that isn't boring
"I bought this book because everyone was talking about it, but I didn't enjoy it at all.  It was contrived and none of the characters were likeable or well-developed."
"Movie worthy Story, with solid gripping suspense."
I loved this book! I couldn't put it down and read it in 4 hours. I know some have felt like none of the characters were sympathetic but I felt for Rachel and even Megan even Scott. Anna and Tom not so much. Very similar to Gone Girl but I liked this one better. The end was somewhat predictable 1/2 thru with a few unexpected twists.  I would recommend.
"Although I have read my entire life, and I taught reading for 19 years, I had trouble at the beginning of this novel in keeping the storylines of the three women straight. I am so glad I persevered as this novel met every expectation I had and beyond! I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery--you will NOT be disappointed!!"
"I have been hearing about this book for months. It drove me crazy, Rachel , Anna, Meghan. Not one single character with any redeeming quality. Took awhile for me to get use to the chapters on by each character. But when I did I could not put the book down.Maybe it I could have enjoyed the book instead of trying to figure out what was going on. Did it entertain me yes. Would I recommend the book in a word no."
"This is a great thriller. I took it on vacation with me and hardly spoke until I was finished. Ha ha, you know how it is.  A lot has already been written about the book because it's that good. For me, the drinking problems of one of the characters is so well written, I can visualize what addiction must be like. I've never read anything like this; what the character thinks, does, and consequences on a daily basis. It is relentless. I am astonished at this author's writing. I couldn't put it down."
such a long drug out and very boring.
"The book is written in the first person from three different characters.  I found this writing style overly confusing and cumbersome.as I would often forget which character was writing.  Otherwise, the story kept my interest, even though at times, I felt, overly descriptive of the emotion felt by each character.  Dare I say it is possibly a book enjoyed more by women than men."
"I started this book several times and put it down. Finally finished it because I thought it might improve as I read further. Unfortunately not. Difficult to convey exactly how annoying the three main characters (women) were, although in truth they are all the same woman.  Weak story, obvious from the start--at least to a frequent mystery reader."
Good story. Kept my interest.
"There is a reason this is a bestseller. I read the book in anticipation of sometime catching the movie, as I think Emily Hunt is the bees knees ;-) This plot is inventive and where it isn't, it exudes a fresh perspective. If you like psychological suspense, I recommend. (But let's face it, I'm waaay behind the curve on this one!)"
I was a fan of the Gillian Flynn novels so I read this one because of all of the comparisons. It was such a let down. All the reviews that refer to the main character being unlikeable are completely true but more than that the problem was just the plot. I wasn't intrigued because I was too busy being annoyed. The climax isn't exciting because it feels completely out of no where and there just wasn't enough foreshadowing in my opinion. It could have been really great and I did enjoy the idea of the plot but overall it misses the mark.
WHY is there so much praise for this TERRIBLE book?!!!  I cannot BELIEVE that anyone thinks this book is so fantastic!!  It's DEPRESSING and poorly written.  Don't waste your money!!
"I really enjoyed this book, in particular the way in which the story unfolds from the differing perspectives of the various key characters.  I must admit I picked the ""whodunnit"" fairly early in the book, but this did not detract from the enjoyment, as obviously this was not confirmed till the end.  A lot of comparisons are made between this book and ""Gone Girl"" but I thought this was a lot better."
"It's hard to like a book when you dislike all the main characters.  I wanted to like this book.  However, all of the main characters were horrible people, and,  in the end, I didn't care what happened to them because whatever horrible things happened to them they deserved 10 fold. I truly can't imagine why it's getting such good reviews.  I do think it might make a better movie than a book, though."
"This was a good little fiction novel and a super quick read. I bought it in hopes to have it read before I saw the movie and was able to, no problem. I finished it in one sitting of about 5-6 hours. It was engaging and interesting and just what I was hoping for as a break from textbooks <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0089> I'll definitely check out more of her books!"
"From the moment I started reading the sample of this book I was hooked and had no choice but to buy it. The immense depth of each character, especially Rachel, pulled me in immediately making me want to know everything I could about their chaotic world. This book makes me want to take a train ride but then again, perhaps not, I'm afraid of what I might see."
"Sorry for the cliche, but I literally could not put this book down. I was ill today, went to bed early with the thought of reading a few pages before nodding off. Yah right. My plans were completely thwarted with suspense, driven by twists that you discover through three different characters' narration,  point-of-view, and raw, personal stories. I love Hawkin's writing style."
"Couldn't wait to finish the book.  And a twist at the end, just what I like.  Will watch the movie when it comes out and I hear that Emily Blunt is going to Rachel.  Not sure how that will work-I would l think she w/be a Megan.  But she is a good actress and will have to eat more for sure.  Interesting to glimpse into the mind of an alcoholic trying to cope w/a failed marriage.  She likes to torture herself though and does not make good decisions about just about everything."
Flawed characters with all sorts of intertwining complications  set in a London suburb. The main character is pitiable at times but shows remarkable steadfastness in solving a personal mystery. Some really clever unexpected twists made this book the center of my attention for awhile. Recommended for anyone who loves a good mystery which has just enough characters to keep it interesting without the need to keep track of obscure characters that pop in and out of the plot line sporadically. Great read!
"I rated this book four stars because it was kind of confusing at the beginning trying to keeping track of the characters. Once you get the characters clear in your mind, the story flowed along in a coherent manner. The twists and turns kept you wondering. I loved the suspense. I recommend this book to anyone who likes mystery novels."
I loved this book. It was so well written and impossible to put down. The storyline and the characters fit together well without going all over the place. It's a who dun it of sorts. I am hoping for another book written by this author and eagerly awaiting the movie in October. Do yourself a favor and buy this book. There's a reason it's been on the NY Times best sellers list for over a year.
"A thoroughly engaging page-turner written so much better than the bestseller it references, ""Gone Girl."" Why the girl on the train and not the woman on the train? Why not capitalize on a a bestseller with a similar story. Girl on the Train kept me thinking...Is she schizophrenic? Is the ex schizophrenic? Was it all in her imagination? It would have been more interesting than the way it wrapped up so quickly and so neatly, something many novels or poor editing suffers from. For a thoroughly good romp, take a ride on the train!"
"I kept waiting for this book to envelop me. I read because I wanted to get to the end...to believe that the story would become layered and intense......it was just a long-drawn out saga of a drunk woman who couldn't get it together. I guessed the end before it took place and picked the plot out of the story.....so, the revelation was nothing new. Was disappointing."
On the same plain as Gone Girl but with characters that at least drew your sympathy and empathy.  In Gone Girl I could have cared less about what happened to the characters.  Girl on the Train's characters were more human and had traits one could relate to.
"The biggest mystery of this story is how in the world it even made the best seller's list, let alone has risen to #1. I rarely drop a book after reading it partially, but this is an exception. I managed 30% and gave up. The alcoholic fears and ramblings of the two women in the story are of no interest to me. Sorry, but no redeeming features are found here."
"The heroine is sappy and predictable, and afforded little depth besides her trite ""daddy"" issues, unconditional romanticism of her dysfunctional marriage, and eye-roll inducing alcoholism. Still, she is not unlikeable as a companion for a day at the beach. The plot easily picks up from any distractions you may encounter. It reads like a summer flick, and the biggest element of this plodding mystery is what actors will play the leading roles. Cotton candy, summer reading."
It was a good book. I saw commercials for the movie so I imagined the characters like that. Ppl say the movie is better than the book. I didn't see it yet. I'm waiting for my love to come home to watch it with him. He also read the book and said it was good. I kept wanting to read and read it. Couldn't stop turning the pages. SO GOOD
"The comparisons to Gillian Flynn's style are spot on, though Hawkins tries to up the ante by using three unreliable narrators and planting obvious seeds of doubt in just about every character, major and supporting. The book is well-written, but where Hawkins falls short is in making Rachel or any of the main characters likeable - or even relatable. It's hard to to remain riveted by a mystery in which the protagonist is so weak, that you just don't really care what happens to her at all."
"Based on the reviews, I thought this book would be excellent. However, I barely made it through 10% of it when I began to become bored, and I began asking myself, ""Why did I ever order this book?"". It wasn't at all fast paced, as I like, but rather slow in developing, and it was also set in England, which I usually don't care for anyway. Finally after reading 15% of it, I stopped. Compared to Grisham, Sheldon, Brennan, and Sanford, who are my favorite suspense authors, it was a ""bummer"""
"I LOVED this book. I haven' t read a full book for myself in a very long time and decided to pick this one up. Finished it in just a few days. It was good the whole time, but towards the end I could not put it down. I loved the characters and the style of writing. Easy to follow, deep, relatable, and a kind of dark/sarcastic humor as well. Amazing! I was surprised by the ending too :)"
Good read that held my attention!
I did not like this book.  But because it was on the best sellers list I felt I had to finished reading the book hoping it got better.  I still wonder why it is still get great reviews.  I must be missing something.  I have to say everyone that I have talked to about the book did not like it.
"I really enjoyed reading this book. You have to pay attention to the dates and/ or character changes of each chapter  but the changes caused me to stay focused on every detail. It is well written and  very descriptive. I felt as though I knew each character personally. I saw the newly released movie a few days after Finishing the book.  Movie is very good, too, and makes only a few changes."
"I enjoyed this book for what it is. It could have been 150 pages shorter without the repetition of Rachel's jumbled memories. You get the idea of her character after the first few times she struggles with her memory/drinking.  That aside, I was able to figure out the ending mid-way through but even so, it was still a good read. Finished it in 2 days. If you're looking for an entertaining, somewhat suspenseful, classic ""whodunit""  read this is it."
I love mysteries. I liked that he author developed an intricate plot whose ultimate reveal was a surprise. I appreciated the telling of the story from the views of the various characters as they were involved the story at the same points in time. I did think it overplayed the telling of the narrative through the clouded mind of Rachael. I constantly felt I wanted the author to get on with it...and
I bought this book about 6 months ago but had not gotten around to reading it until now.  I absolutely loved it!  This ranks as one of my favorite reads for this year.  It only took me two days to read it as I was hooked from the beginning.  I loved the twists and turns of the plot and was really surprised at the ending.  Now I know why this has been on the best seller list for so long.
The main characters are immature and self-serving people without much regard or consideration for their actions.  I thought this novel was just another story about over-sexed individuals and alcoholics who make stupid decisions and mess up their lives.  The writing was very well done. The movie is about to come out next week and the author has done pretty well financially for her first trashy romance-thriller.
"This book had a decent mystery component to it but it could have been shortened by half. I admit to be ""character driven"" and most enjoy books where I can either empathize or admire one or more characters. I found Rachel tiresome and so needy it was frustrating. In Girl on the Train it difficult to like or even sympathize with any of the characters so I struggled to get though it. If I hadn't had to read it for my book club I would quit reading it after a few pages."
"I bought this book just because it was on the best seller list without looking what it was about. I really like the premise about an alcoholic girl who witnessed things important to a murder investigation that no one believes. The book is told from three different women's point of view. The main thing I disliked about the book was the changing of perspectives that I felt weren't transitioned particularly well to form a seamless story early. Later on they started making a lot more sense, and were a lot smoother. All together it was a decent but slightly depressing with very few if any characters that are likable."
I really wanted to like this book as it has so many fantastic reviews and has just been made into a movie. But as I sit here having just finished it I don't feel connected to the characters in anyway and am actually rather annoyed at how it ended. I found the book extremely predictable and all the female characters were weak while the male characters were all abusive.. Not really my cup of tea
"I liked the story here. Saw the movie first, which was good, but this was thrilling too, and obviously better in a certain sense. Rachel was a very sympathetic protagonist and while the hopping around with characters and timelines was confusing at first, I think it made for a clever reveal. While Anna, Megan, and Scott were not my favorite characters, they were complex and I enjoyed reading them."
"This strange and ultimately not quite satisfying novel begins oddly enough with divorced Rachael Watson traveling past her ex-husband's and his new wife's condo located next to the tracks of her commuter train near London. Due to a malfunctioning railway signal the train frequently comes to a complete halt giving her a good view.  But of most interest to her is an unknown couple she names Jess and Jason who live a few doors up and, based on her fragmentary spying, seem to be immensely happy. Or so she idealizes.Rachael's interest is piqued when she observes some disturbing behavior at Jess's home but turns to alarm when Jess' disappearance becomes a major story in the newspapers. She insinuates herself into the situation in various ways but she can't recall everything she sees and does. The problem: she binge drinks and has blackouts. The story is told from the perspectives of Rachael, Jess, and Anna, her ex's new wife both from the past and in the present.The problem with this story is that all of the back and forth becomes a substitute for complexity. The essence of the story is the rapid uncovering of the unsophisticated lies of a small group of rather unappealing characters. The book really does not quite reach its initial promise."
"This book started out good, then turned into a Lifetime Movie...you know the one when the guy (boyfriend, husband, stalker...whatever the lead MALE is in the movie) is trying to kill the lead women in the kitchen while it is raining outside... Such a shame, I would have loved there to have been more about voyeuristic angle from the beginning of the book. SPOLIER ALERT!! I wish the lead character would have died at the end...would have made it at least an additional star rating for me if that had happened."
"I read this knowing it had been opted to become a film which may have led me to judge critically. I was curious about the rave reviews so I actually paid for this book while most of my reading is free thru Prime. I felt the writing was mediocre but I do see a great film possibility. It will be one of those movies where we say ""The movie was actually better than the book?!"""
"I loved this book!  I loved how the characters were developed.  I loved how the story was told by each of the three women.  As I was reading the book, I kept thinking that I must be close to the end but then there was another twist that I had never considered.  After reading the book, I saw the movie and the book was much better than the movie."
"The plot was intriguing with well developed characters, but I couldn't relate to any of them except Rachel's roommate who tried to help Rachel get back on her feet and put up with her drinking and lying. Unfortunately, the roommate was the only boring character. The story did move at a steady clip and kept my interest with several surprises."
"This book was great! I will admit, it took some time to get into it. I encourage those starting this book to KEEP WITH IT! I finished the book on my kindle on a plane and immediately needed to chat with others about the ending. However, I was travelling alone and mostly everyone around me was sleeping. Looking forward to seeing the film adaptation!"
This book was recommended to me last summer.  I immediately bought it but read it slowly.  I found it was being made into a movie so I sped up my pace!  Totally worth the read!  So many twists and turns; I couldn't predict what was gonna happen next.  I still haven't seen the movie but I wanted to finish the book 1st.  Glad I waited!
I couldn't finish this one and boy did I try! It started out very well with an intriguing premise and main character. But then of course it started jumping around from first to second to third person and the story became way too complex than it deserved to be. This was a Gone Girl wanna be and I didn't care for it. Maybe one day I'll get around to finishing it.
I could not put this book down it was such an amazing novel. I would definitely recommend this to people who love a good mystery.
"Excellent book, could not put it down! On the edge of your seat the entire time. Keeps you guessing, an excellent suspenseful journey through the blurred eyes of an alcoholic and the characters surrounding her in scandal. Intricately devised to change gears and take you back and forth in time to hone in on the BIG reveal. Can't wait for the movie!!!"
"It didn't take long to get sucked into the story. I an an emotional reaction to our main character right away, and it wasn't always positive. There were times I just wanted to shake her! There are subtle clues throughout about ""whodunit"" that do come together in the end. Presented in an interesting fashion. I'm glad I took the time to read it."
"I hate to say I got so intrigued by this one because it's basically trashy. Somewhat like ""Gone Girl"" (another piece of trash I'm ashamed I couldn't put down) but this one at least had two characters (Rachel and Anna) that weren't totally evil. Rachel was pathetic but somewhat redeemed herself, and Anna was really OK from the get-go - except (I won't spoil anything here . . .). Enjoyed the ""British angle"" and will see the movie - will be interested in whom they cast in the parts!"
"i liked the story after i finished it. it had a nice resolution, closure.all the clues and foreshadowing came together at the end, resolved nicely, once and for all.but oh man, i hated reading through it. it was such a painful experience because Rachel, a main narrator, was such an obnoxious character.i almost quit mid-way because i couldn't put up with her thoughts and actions anymore; she's alcoholic, has too much self-pity, stalks other people, annoyingly apologetic, and keeps making the same bad decisions over and over again; well, i guess that last part was necessary because that's what essentially moves the plot forward."
"The story is told by three separate first person narratives.  As you travel through them you may, as I did, come to realize that you really care very little for any of those three characters.  I think this is generally because the narrative is so narrow, self directed and centered on poor choices that none of them are even vaguely appealing.  There is no champion for whom you can cheer or victim for whom you mourn.  However, the narratives are written finely and in great detail. That means you cannot get caught up in the story because you must read and ""feel"" every word.  There are only six characters with any meaningful involvement in the story, so determining the villain was not challenging.  It also left me with an ending that was less than satisfying.  Generally speaking, I'm just happy that it's over."
"Great psychological thriller that is hard to put down.  Reminiscent of Gone Girl and Rear Window.  Whe reader gets a lot of first person information, mainly from the three female characters, but doesn't really know what's real and what is fabricated or imagined until all of the stories are compared.  When the truth is revealed, you'll still want to flip back to review. You'll also have the shivers for days."
"I had such high hopes for this book. Every female character was not only portrayed as helpless drunks, but even the male characters had no development! The story itself was very well written by an obviously talented author, but the entire novel is written in a cloudy haze that suddenly takes an undesirable turn. Read it in two days, it had me hooked, but the second half of the book did not come full circle as I expected it would."
"I'm only about a third of the way through the book and can't seem to make myself pick it up again. I don't like Rachel or Megan. Utterly selfish and self absorbed people. Haven't read much about Anna yet. I can certainly see the twists and turns coming, but I don't really care about any of these women. So far, none have any redeeming qualities, which is what they need."
"Rachel Watson is the miserable poster woman for a Borderline Personality-disordered alcoholic who is depressed, anxious and has no redeemable qualities as a human being.  The premise itself is interesting; the point of view of the voyeuristic train passenger who imagines the lives of those living along the tracks of her daily commute.  Rachel finds herself in the middle of a mystery she feels compelled to participate in as a main character.  Just when you think her obnoxious and unreliable participation will actually contribute to something positive and meaningful - you are reminded that she is so shallow and self-serving that nothing good will come from her interference.  The other characters are equally as shallow and self-serving.  Although the book is very well-written and certainly interesting in it's telling, I couldn't help but be distracted by the fact that everyone was unlikable.  Ultimately, I was disappointed in the fact that Rachel never became a better person and we never learned the source of her sociopathic behavior. There was no one to root for  (not even the police) and in the end I am baffled as to why everyone was as deranged as they were."
"I am into psychological thrillers at the moment and seeing the popularity of this book/film I had to read it.  I wasn't disappointed.  It's the tale of a  commuter getting involved in the aftermath of a crime when she goes to the police with some information, gleaned from the window of the train, which she thinks might help.  Each chapter is from the perspective of several characters involved and as the story progresses the suspense builds up.  Let's hope Paula Hawkins writes more like this."
I enjoyed this book so much! I wish I had read it sooner. It deserves an award for being so well written that it is very hard to put down.  I will be reading this authors books from now on.  I have been through many of the things all of these women experienced so I felt close to each one of them.  This is a must read for anyone that has been fooled or abused by someone they love and trust.
"I just finished this book and it is incredible!! I would suggest reading Gone Girl first and then this book, partly because of the style of writing each author has in leading up to the end. Gone Girl is so good, and having read it first made this book even better due to the writing styles and how they layout the plots. As soon as I finished I wanted to re-read the whole book, in a Sixth Sense kind of way! I will definitely read again. Could EASILY be a movie and a great one at that!"
"this was my first audio book, i bought for an international flight. was so glad i did, because my eyes did not dry out from reading and i did not have to bother anyone with a reading light. Also, I used with Bose noise cancelling headphones. The actors were fantastic. I swear the lead character sounded just like Judi Densch."
"Not one sympathetic character in the book.  Five main characters and not one of them has any redeeming values.  If this is the world Hawkins lives in, she has my utmost sympathy.  It is one of the worst books I have read in a long time and I read a LOT of books. If you want mystery/thrillers stick with Sandford, Child, Connelly, Silva, Flynn, Baldacci, Coben, DeMille, Thor, etc.  Do not spend your time or money on this book.  You'll regret it."
"Outstanding psychological novel. The author takes you on a wild journey through the eyes of the three women in the story. Not until near the end does the terrible truth begin to reveal itself. On the way there, you are buffeted by the stories of the protagonists, live their anguish and their hopes, move with them through the landscape of the tale. I haven't been so engrossed in a novel for some time. One of those books you can't wait to finish to find out what happens but then feel devastated that it's over. A masterpiece."
"Well written, fluid transitions between different perspectives. If you love to read about messed up characters that remind you why you're not so messed up yourself then this is great haha. But in all seriousness, it was great for a mystery read. Couldn't stop turning the pages"
"I have to give this well-written, fast-paced story 5 stars because I was unable to put it down and read it in a day. The protagonist and her drinking problem kept me on the edge of my seat. How was she ever going to get her life in order and gain self respect when she was usually strongly under the influence and thus unaware of reality which led to gaping holes in her memory. The realization of the truth behind those dark spaces is vital to Rachel's credibility and eventual healing. This book should appeal to a wide audience."
glad I picked up this book.  Quick interesting read.  could easily visualize the movie in my mind
"I love unreliable narrators. This one being an alcoholic adds that extra layer of the narrator not knowing herself how reliable she is, and when she lies to herself, you can see through it. On the downside, I felt like the big reveal was pretty obvious if you were paying attention and I prefer to be surprised. Also, there are two narrators and their voices were not distinctive enough from each other, so sometimes I forgot who was talking. I really wouldn't compare this to Gone Girl at all."
"Interesting story but a number of elements seemed highly unlikely.  From the beginning, the characters were presented as highly dysfunctional. I suppose that was supposed to add to the mystery of identifying the person responsible for Jess' disappearance. As a reader, I felt that they all needed intense therapy. It was a very creative and clever plot that could have evolved more realistically. I would recommend you read it as many people have not been as bothered by psychology."
"I never thought I would read the whole novel. In the beginning, the main character was pathetic. I didn't want to read pages and pages of her problems. I must admit, however, I didn't put the book down. It was a mystery, and I wanted to see it solved. In the end, I couldn't put it down. There were parts of this book that were long, but an enjoyable book nonetheless."
"The most interesting aspect of this book was its portrayal of alcoholism - its causes and its costs.  It is interesting that another recent novel ""Elizabeth is Missing"" also has an investigator undermined by a disability, in her case dementia.  Perhaps its a trend!  I found the male characters a bit unreal and the rhythm of events a bit sleepy making but it was a clever idea.."
"Reading this now! DIfficult book to put down once you start reading.  Not the usual form of writing that I enjoy, more descriptions from the characters than dialogue.  There are several characters and the book seems to individualize the characters in way that you can still keep track on who is who.  Looking forward to finishing. Will update at completion."
"This book failed to deliver anything even remotely entertaining.  The characters are all so dysfunctional and flawed that it's impossible to connect to any of them.  It's a pain trying to keep the time-line straight as it jumps around too much from the perspective of three different unlikeable women.  Half-way through the book I was praying they'd all get hit by the train.  The ending was predictable, there were no twists or surprises.  Just dull and boring from start to finish.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone!"
"I absolutely loved this book.  It was a real page turner!  I had all sorts of emotions from both liking and hating Rachel, then feeling sorry for her and back to hating her again for her weakness.  At the end I was totally relating to her and pulling for her to have a good future.  In fact, I still think of her almost as if she was a real person that I know and I find myself hoping that she is happy and doing well.  Now, I call that a good book.Barbara Miller Whitton"
"Very disappointed. This book does not live up to its hype and I am sorry I wasted my money.  Confusing...I felt like I needed to take notes or have Cliff Notes to keep up. Not for pleasure reading at all.  My first by this author and I understand this is a new genre for her, hopefully she goes back to something better. Perhaps listening to it would be better."
This book was everything I was hoping for and more...  I found myself constantly second guessing who did what and when and where.  This book came highly recommended and I would highly recommend it to you!
Hard to stay on time with the story.  Good story but was confusing. I couldn't finish it.
"I was generally disappointed in this book given all the hype and five-star reviews. While similar to Gone Girl, it was not as rich in character development. I found it difficulty to care about the fate of any of the main characters.  I suspected ""the twist""about halfway through. Normally, this would not have been a problem had the writing and characters been more compelling. Still, it's probably a matter of taste."
"I ENJOYED  THIS BOOK.,  SINCE MY STROKE I HAVE A HARD TIME FOLLOWING A STORY LINE, II WILL ADMIT I HAD TO GO BACK AND REREAD SOME PAGES,  BUT I REALLY  ENJOYED  THIS NOVEL ANDI IT WAS FAIRLY EASY FOR ME TO FOLLOW.!"
I wasn't as impressed as others were about this book I guess. Not enough meat to the story. Too much flip flopping back and forth between characters.It was just okay.
"This book is fantastic! The story is well written and every character is developed properly. The action was great; the story was at a fast pace, perfect for the suspenseful plot. I ended up blazing through it because I just couldn't put it down! If you enjoy Gillian Flynn's novels, you'll like this one. Highly recommended."
"I'd rather stick needles in my eyes than read this book it never got off the ground. I needed it for a book club but resigned after ""trying to read this dull book."
"An interesting twist; one of the main characters of this who dunnit is an alcoholic, subject to blackouts and memory loses who wonders whether she might be the guity party.  Everyone here has character flaws; there are no good guys.  In the end, the outcome is not terrible surprising, as virtually anyone could have done it.  this almost doesn't matter, however, as the more interesting story is who succumbs to his/her demons and who overcomes them.  The journey, not its conclusion, was the best part of the read here."
"This book I didn't think I was going to continue reading but then I told myself ""it has to get better"".  Am I glad I did.  The story just kept building and building with such an explosive ending.  I will be looking anything else Paula Hawkins has written!  Now I can't wait to see the movie to make sure they did the book justice."
"I was really surprised at the high praise over this novel. I found it pretty disappointing, the author extremely focused on adultery relationships. The author is a journalist, yet the writing seemed very uneducated--some sentences were run-ons and difficult to sort out because o the rambling style of the narrative. There were times the story pulled me along and made me curious.  Clearly, many others liked this novel but it just wasn't for me."
Compelling page turner about characters that consistently make bad decisions. There is no one you can really like or admire in the story. Still couldn't put it down. Will make a pretty good movie done right.
"Paula Hawkins is a truly gifted writer who I hope will write many more books in the future.Her characters are extremely well-defined,and with the unbelievable pacing of this psychological thriller and her genius for writing...you have an instant hit.I was torn between slowly pacing myself and quickly going from page to page to uncover yet another twist and turn.This is undoubtedly one of the best books I've read...truly enjoyable!"
"It was a pretty good book, once I decided to quit trying to keep up with the dates of each chapter, it was a pretty easy read.  I got the feeling I had read this before, the plot was very familiar and I predicted the ending pretty early into the book which is very unusual because you really can't see it coming.  Either way, worth reading."
The most amusing fact about this book is that each character had flaws. The plot kept you interested and you couldn't help but root for Rachel to get her life in order. The common theme that keeps repeating is that not everything is as it seems when looked at from a distance.The book had several twists and jumped back and forth in time. I enjoyed the story as well as the pace that it was told. It gave the reader time to feel like they met each one of the main characters. Enjoyable and suspenseful.
I thought it will captivate me from the beginning but it didn't happen. It took me a long time to finish because it is not one of those books that you can't put down.
"This a nuanced mystery that unfolds gradually as the reader experiences three alternating points of view. Each narrator is unreliable for different reasons and the lines between truth/lies and reality/fantasy are ever-shifting. Hawkins' careful pacing and overlaying of timelines/action ensures that we feel the confusion, frustration, and agonizing anticipation of the three narrators. This tale is a chilling reminder that there are many types of abuse, and we never really know what happens behind closed doors…even, at times, our own."
"It isn't hard to put yourself in the position of the narrator. Every day you ride the same train on the same route with the same people into the same huge city where you're another anonymous cog in the wheel. Your sense of being invisible has become literal; you no longer care what passengers think of you as you open the gins and tonic (they're sold in cans in England) that will make the day go by in a pleasant fog. As far as you're concerned, you're a nobody. And each time the train passes your ex-husband's house, which used to be yours, you know that you're nobody. You see the new wife, the one he was seeing before he left you. And you notice that the daughter they had is getting bigger.So, you've trained yourself to look a few houses down. There's a woman sitting in her front garden. Some mornings she's reading; other times she's drinking a cup of tea. The man who comes out and joins her is not bad looking, and so, with nothing else to do you start to make up stories about the lives of the couple. After all, if you were still married, you'd be neighbors. And you decide that you'd be friends. Until. One morning. When everything changes."
"Rachel is the girl on the train.  She is a divorced alcoholic who continues to ride the train on her daily commute, even though she no longer has a job.  While riding the train, she watches her old neighborhood and believes that she knows the inhabitants of the homes she watches, giving them names and stories.  One day she believes she has seen something odd and that same day, the wife of one of the couples she watches, disappears.  Rachel imposes herself upon the investigation and the story begins to move rapidly with several characters telling their stories.  It has been compared to Gone Girl and it does have a back and forth quality, but for this reader, it was a better story and one that  I could not predict or figure out easily.  The descriptions of Rachel's alcoholic days are a brutal picture of self deception and a wasting of life.  Her muddled memory makes for an interesting investigation of what she believes may have happened to the woman who disappeared.  Paula Hawkins knows her way around her pen and a corkscrew!"
"I've seen this book on the shelves of many bookstores for months. Then seen the posters of it upcoming movie version, and had to see what the hype was about. Worth the buy, worth the read. Beautiful poetry, and genuinely insightful of marriages and thoughts of characters. Incredible story that keeps you guessing and forking who, and in the end it amazingly surprising."
"I started this book only because friends told me it was good.  At first, I didn't believe what they were telling me but I kept reading. This book is so well written that after a short time I could not have stopped.  The mystery is woven into twisted that kept me reading. I needed to know what happens to Megan, and Rachel.  It has 5 stars from me plus if you haven't read it, I suggest you do."
"The Girl on a Train is a murder mystery (and perhaps a psychological thriller) about an alcoholic woman who suspects foul play between a couple she spies while riding on a train. The chapters alternate between three different points of view: Rachel, the woman on the train; Anna, the new wife of Rachel’s ex; and Megan, the woman Rachel sees from the train. The alternating POVs helps build the suspense throughout the book but I occasionally was confused by who “I” and “she” were in the narrative. This confusion was compounded by the fact that the author purposely made those terms ambiguous to increase the suspense.The character and setting descriptions are outstanding. The sometimes long narratives helped build the tension and heightened the sense of impending danger. Rachel is an alcoholic who just can’t stay sober. Consequently, she is an unreliable witness and she makes sometimes incredibly bad choices. The bad choices border on the unbelievable which is the fine line fiction authors must walk in order to write compelling stories. Rachel reminds me of Whip Whitfield, the alcoholic pilot, played by Denzel Washington, in the movie, Flight. Rachel and Whip can’t help themselves - their addictions to alcohol are just too strong and they just keep on drinking to the detriment of their well-being and survival."
I was so excited to read this book after hearing all the hype and rave reviews. However I found the book to be almost tedious. The book's protagonist wasn't a likable character which could have contributed to my wanting it to end. The chapters seemed repetitive. The ending was a bit of a surprise which is why I gave 3 stars instead of 2.
". . . is that it gets you deeply into situations when you have only a small understanding or even a BIG MISUNDERSTANDING of what is really going on.  This situation gets even more complicated when the misunderstandings are multiplied by three different narrators, Rachel, Megan, and Anna, each with her own assumptions and misunderstandings about the other two.  And when one is an alcoholic (not recovering, unfortunately), and the other two are seductresses caught in love triangles with one another’s husbands, friends, and therapists, then it gets really complicated trying to figure out what’s real and what was only imagined or misunderstood.  That this entire narration is so interesting, really so captivating, is to the credit of author Hawkins’ considerable skills.  Not a comic, but a tragic tale, and well worth the time."
3 Crazy women and crazier men!  This book is not worth the read. A mystery of sorts but mostly predictable.
I chose to read this book since the movie was coming out soon. I literally could not stop reading this until I was finished .  I liked the book overall. It kept my interest the whole time. I did like the way it switched perspectives but it was also a little hard to keep track of since they were also from different time frames. I also called the killer early in the book so it was a bit predictable. Overall its definitely a good read.
"Not a bad story, however it was spoiled for me from the start because I was born in Witney, and lived there, on and off, into the early 1960's when the Witney railway station was closed.  As far as I know, the tracks were also taken up in the early 1970's, and the fact that this seems to have been completely missed/overlooked made the whole thing annoying."
"I should have waited for the movie version so that I could not watch the movie.... I am not sure why I finished reading this book. ALL of the characters were unlikeable, actually I found myself hating all the characters... I was hoping that they would all do each other in suicide pact.... If you have some time to kill and low expectations pick another book. This was no Gone Girl..."
"I read several chapters and put it down. I don't like depressing character studies. Why are all the new novels on the best sellers list of this boring genre? There is enough in life to be sad about without ""entertaining"" oneself with hopeless stories."
"I finished it only because I prefer to finish what I start. I thought it started out well, and I was interested. Then I thought the main character got too pathetic."
"I've spent three summer days straight following this story, and I Typically have trouble getting into a book. This book had me guessing around every ""chapter"" if you will. I did enjoy the layout of perspective and the way in which each chapter is dated leading up to the resolve of this mystery. This book, without a doubt, makes you feel the part of the dark and dismal life that Rachel was left with post-divorce, and that implied feeling really sums up the conclusion. Great read!"
Though dark and sad the book held my interest. Very original plot but too depressing.  Depended on the drinking made Ra
"One of the best ways to build suspense and keep the reader wondering who the killer might be is through the device of the unreliable narrator. This book capitalizes on major characters who have seriously traumatic backgrounds and who are narrating their mistaken version of what is happening while trying to break through their foggy delusions. Somehow these narrators are sympathetic, too."
"A very well-written novel exploring dark secrets and vices of ordinary people. Read it in 1 day, totally fascinated by the narration, but was rather disappointed in the end, as the story unveiled in such a way that there is no one to sympathize - not that every character is bad, but stupid in their behavior, which is much worse.Despite that this girl is worth reading, and I guess even more engaging if one can relate with any of the characters."
"I enjoyed the multi-dimensional use of the train in this novel.  (The title of the book, the character of Rachel who is the 'girl on the train' and the views created from the moving train.)  That being said I thought the characters were undeveloped and unrealistic.  Also, unlike others, I did not see a need to compare this book to Flynn's ""Gone Girl"".  Worth the read to resolve the mysteries, but for me it was okay rather than great."
The Girl on the Train is written in a style of chapters titled by characters in the novel. (This is not my favorite style) so I approached the first few chapters with passive attention. As I got into the book the characters drew me in. The author held the solution to the crime until the end. Characters were well developed and one could relate to their characteristics. I enjoyed the book and recommend it if you like mysteries that end when it ends.
I enjoyed this book very much. The story has a slow buildup but the suspense was just enough to not be boring. Kept me guessing about what was going on. I also liked the story being told from the perspectives of the three main female characters. That gave the story a little more dimension. I'd recommend this one for a good weekend read.
"Now I see why The Girl On The Train is this year's Gone Girl.  Rachel rides the train daily to London, watching one particular couple as she passes their house.  She playfully names them Jess and Jason and creates their own perfect fantasy marriage.  But one day, the lady of the house is nowhere to be seen.  Rachel suspects foul play.  She confronts the police and nearby neighbors.  There's one huge catch: Rachel has a drinking problem.  She's an unreliable witness, and has an ugly past with the neighborhood.  If she keeps prying, Rachel could become the next headline.  Written from the perspective of Rachel, Anna and Megan, Hawkins displays her Train ladies as journal entries, taken in morning and evening segments.  Will anyone ever believe Rachel, especially the fateful night she can't quite remember?  Is Anna really the sweet, caring, overprotective mom?  And what about Megan, the missing artist with the twisted past?  Hitchcock in its styling, with enough red herrings to open an aquarium, and a tarnished heroine the reader can root for, The Girl On The Train is well worth the ticket. I can't wait for the movie!"
"This book was pretty amazing, despite the lack of characters that I could relate to or even like. This book has similarities to Gone Girl, but there's so much more to it. Halfway through the book was when it started to get good, and honestly I rushed it these last few days just because I wanted to watch the movie. Overall, I'm glad I read it and the end was shocking to me!"
"Still unsure where all the raving reviews are coming from. In my mind, I equated the storyline loosely with Gone Girl in the sense that I did not like any of the main characters; however, Gone Girl's storyline was more enthralling and the writing was more intriguing.The main character of this novel was annoying and frustrating, as she repeatedly comments how much she hates herself for her struggle with alcohol, but never does anything to change her behavior. If the story had revolved more around her struggle with alcohol in an empathetic way, that would have been more interesting and perhaps helped the reader to develop feelings for the character - instead you just wanted to reach out and shake sense into her.Overall, the story was predictable and the end was not much of a ""shocker"" since you really didn't have many feelings for what happened to any of the characters by that point. The plot had potential that was never reached and the writing disappointed after so many positive reviews have been written for it."
"I'm always skeptical of some of the latest trending books that only seem to be doing so because a movie is based on it as they tend to be quite predictable.  But The Girl on the Train had me questioning every character all of the time.  I loved it so much, I finished it in a weekend's time, which is difficult to do being a working mom to a young boy.  Absolutely loved it!"
"I really wanted to give this book 5 stars, but the only thing holding me back was that I thought that the ending wasn't as detailed as the rest of the book and felt a little rushed. However, it didn't detract from the story and the story was fabulous in every way!  It took me about 3 or 4 chapters to get my head around who the main character was. It would have been helpful to have a little notebook handy and write down which character and date I was reading as the chapters jump back and forth a bit just as they did in Gone Girl and initially I found it difficult to follow but it is well worth persevering. Rachel, the main character is fascinating to follow as she embeds herself in the lives of others and tackles her own issues at the same time. I started to determine the answers to the mystery about halfway through and was pretty sure about it at about the three quarter mark. I would have liked the story to have given a bit more detail around the character of Megan as it would have been nice to see what made her tick also. Overall, a great and entertaining story. I would recommend reading if you like a psychological drama/thriller."
"This was one of the most interesting book I've read in a long time.  Seen through the eyes of the three characters, each chapter changing from one to the other, I just couldn't put it down.  I read it in one day.  It fascinated me to see how imagination and reality can be so very, very different.  Until you get to the end, you have no idea what on earth is really happening here.......Paula Hawkins writes a story full of twists and turns that keep the reader guessing until the end.  I don't want to be a spoiler, so I won't even mention the issue this story revolves around, but the main character, Rachel, is so very confused and ill that one begins to wonder if what she is seeing is truth or fantasy.  It illustrated how one person, just because of a serious addictive problem, can be manipulated and pulled into a complex weave of circumstances, all of which look bad for her, all the while the reader not knowing what is happening is her delusion or the truth.....if you want a fast, interesting, fast paced and pretty tricky little story, this is for you."
"Goodness, do I ever love an unreliable narrator, and this novel has the most unreliable of narrators in the history of unreliable narration. It’s great!This book is dark and edgy and left me feeling kind of squicky when it was all said and done, but in the best possible way.Rachel isn’t the most likable of characters and we’ve already discussed the fact that her narration is unreliable, but she’s so damned interesting. Alcoholism aside, she’s wounded and confused and you get the impression that she thinks she’s doing the right thing, although it’s really just covering up the fact that she’s lost and wandering around in her own life and just ends up causing more harm than good.These characters are difficult to root for and are flawed in the most impressive ways, yet you cannot help but delve into their psyches and revel in every sordid mistake.This book is a spooky, atmospheric page-turner and I loved every minute of it."
Writing was schizophrenic.  Characters were not developed until halfway through the book.  I was 1/3 of the way through the book before I could distinguish one from the other.  And then they all were boring and unpleasant.  I didn't care about any of them and didn't care who was dead and who wasn't! I was so disappointed in this book - it was talked about and some folks recommended it.  My book club just finished it and I am waiting to see what the other members of my group thought of it.  Right now it is on my DO NOT RECOMMEND list for my reading friends.
Chiefly because of the alternating persons format and partly due to back and forth time switches the book was a little hard to follow when you read as I do...a chapter here; a few pages there. But overall I found it an engaging read.  As a recovering alcoholic myself I found it interesting that several of the characters showed strong signs of the disease.
"I can see why people compare this to Gone Girl, but I do not see why so many people liked it. Where Gone Girl took the genre and turned it on it's head, demanding more from the genre of suspense thriller as a whole, Girl On The Train simply takes you down a path that has been tread before. Yes, there's an unreliable narrator but it's not cleverly used like Roger Ackroyd. She's just an unreliable lush with cryptic memories. I was hoping for something captivating and intriguing, but what I got was the screenplay version of a story I've seen before, already watered down for me."
"This book was incredible. Prior to reading it, I had not seen the movie and my only knowledge of the plot was the vagueness from the trailer.I was so pleasantly surprised with how involved I got and how intense the plotime was. I listened to the audio version and couldn't turn it off. Absolutely incredible if you like thrillers."
"A little bit predictable, but a good little story nonetheless. I liked the writing style and even though it jumped a little with regard to the storyteller at the time, I got into the rhythm quite quickly. I was drawn to the characters who were described well and found myself identifying with certain traits, which made it easier to empathise with them. All in all a good read and would recommend for holiday or wet weekend read ."
"The story was exciting and suspenseful and a very good read. However, it was slow in the beginning, almost boring. But,you could tell it was leading you somewhere, and it made you want to continue reading. The last few chapters became suspenseful and exciting with somewhat of a surprise ending. I enjoyed the book and would recommend for others to read it."
"I don't know why everyone thinks this book is so great! After months of hearing how smashing this book is, I finally bought it and was bitterly disappointed. The main character is a jerk. Not because she's an alcoholic, I have compassion for that, it's because she's really unlikeable. I hated this book. My husband got 25 pages in and deleted it, he disliked it more than I did."
I was intrigued with this story from the very beginning. Constantly making predictions in my head. I loved the different twists and the different perspectives. I felt as if the middle was dragging but overall a very good book.
Just bad. I'm giving it one star because I'll admit that I guess I was curious enough to know who murdered Megan that I kept reading until the end but I was not by any means sitting on the edge of my seat with suspense as I read through the story. And the whole every character being an asshole/beater/alcoholic/paranoid/cheater thing was just kind of depressing... And the clincher for me was the last line of the book; it was just so cliche/try to tie a witty bow on the end... This was the first murder mystery I'd picked up in a long while and this book makes me want to switch right back to my dramas.
"The Girl on the Train is a must read. It is a page turner and keeps you wanting more. I will provide a plot without any spoilers. It essentially tells the story of a women who has gone down hill after being cheated on and left by her husband. The only thing she looks forward to every day is watching a couple on a patio form the window on the train whom she believes are living the perfect life. However, when the lady she used to watch from the window of her train one day goes missing, she finds herself wrapped up in her disappearance and eager to learn what happened to her. The story is narrated by three women: the lady on the train, the lady who disappears, and the lady who the lady on the train's husband cheated on her with and they all somehow end up being intertwined with one another."
"This was a great book! I loved the intense story plot, and it had a great twist ending. The book was very well written, and the author was amazing at building up suspense. The novel was a little confusing at first, but once you get through the first few chapters, you'll understand the characters. The book alternated points of view, which helped to build up the suspense. This was a great book for my daughters to read. There's also a movie based on this book coming out soon!This book would be a great gift for teens!"
I read into the 2nd chapter and just couldn't get any further.  Very unusual for me as it is extremely rare for me to give up on a book but I just wan not enjoying it.  I had been anticipating reading it from all the hype I had heard about it so was disappointed to find myself struggling to develop any interest or enjoyment in the story.
"How did this book get so many good reviews?!! It wasn't the biggest steaming pile I've ever read but pretty close. I was intrigued by the premise but disappointed (and annoyed) that 90% of the book was Rachel drinking, barfing, peeing herself and/or falling down, making bad choices and then apologizing afterwards. I am sympathetic to addiction, but Rachel's alcoholism felt totally contrived -- it was as if the author just used it as a way to present holes in the story because it was written like how a teenager (or someone who has never drank) would probably perceive it to be. All the characters were pathetic, two dimensional and unbelievable and it read like a never ending daytime soap opera or Lifetime movie. If you're really that interested in solving the mystery just read a spoiler review and be done with it. Wish I had done that instead of wasting my time. Also, this book is NOT anything like Gone Girl except that they both utilize unreliable narration. GG wasn't the best book but at least it was somewhat clever and entertaining."
"My sister had raved about this book so I made it a point to buy it when a discounted price became available.  Hawkins writes well and her story is quite good but I have never met a bunch of less likeable characters.  Perhaps, as a very literal person, I missed her point if Hawkins intended to portray everyone so negatively, but I like at least one person to root for in a book.  The central character was incredibly weak and seemingly proud of her inablity to pull herself out of her neediness and addicton.  The other characters were angry, selfish, violent, and/or not terribly bright.I will credit Hawkins with keeping the ending fairly opaque until near the end but this is not a book I particularly enjoyed.  Plus now I have to fib to my sister."
I started this book months ago and I ended up getting distracted and didn't pick it back up until a week ago. I don't know why I ever stopped reading this in the first place. This is one of the best stories I've read in a long time. I love how the author draws you into these characters and twists this story to make you believe certain people could be capable of such a crime. I spent most of this book convinced I knew who the killer was and what happened but I was completely wrong! I definitely recommend reading this book to anyone looking for a good drama/mystery.
Love it! I could not put this remarkable book down! Very well written and the suspense was off the chart. I keep trying to guess who the killer was the entire time. I would have like more of the husband's background and why he did not have a relationship with his parents! However great book! I would highly recommend this book.
"It's hard to give a book 3 stars when it really kept me tied to my Kindle. But there's a strange dichotomy here. It's a rather dark thriller which kept me guessing until about page 170, where I sort of guessed how things meshed together. But I did not like the characters. Apart from aspects of Scott, I could not feel the empathy a reader should have with at least one or two characters. Rachel, the alcoholic, is one of those women who seem to moan and whine and irritate people. She irritated me, and her frequent and total blackouts after binge drinking were not always convincing. Anna is such a typical weak and clingy type -- but at the very end she's suddenly this amazingly strong woman just when the reader expects her to fall apart. Megan's psychiatrist remains a very vague figure, as does Megan herself. In fact, Megan is the least convincing character.But hey, there's a murder ...nuff said, I don't want to spoil the book for you. The atmosphere right through is somewhat depressing and humour is completely absent. But I guarantee you -- the book will still keep you reading until the very last page."
"This book was a quick read, it pulled me in almost immediately and did not let me go until I finished. There is a feeling of nostalgia throughout the novel that gives you the feeling that you are talking to an old friend you haven't seen in awhile, one who saw you through some difficult times. I am not the best person to review mystery novels because I usually guess who did it before the big reveal. However, I thought the author did a pretty good job of making you doubt what you thought (although she did so by painting every male character as menacing). The main character, Rachel, is pretty sad. You immediately feel bad for her and as you delve further into the story you realize just how pathetic she is. None of the characters are particularly happy or well-rounded people, the women in this story lead especially depressing lives."
Well written but there isn't a likable character in the whole book. Disappointed I spent money to read this and now have no interest in seeing a movie about it. If you like reading books with likable characters stay away from this one.
"Looking forward to seeing the movie and doing a comparison.  While it goes back and forth in time (before, during and after the crime), it was not confusing to follow the time line.  I only gave it 4 stars because I figured out who ""dunnit"" about half way through, but still enjoyed how the author worked it out.  The narrator was also very good, subtly changing her voice for different characters."
"I was thoroughly enthralled with the book.  With the upcoming release of the movie based on the book I wanted to read it ahead of time.  I wasn't disappointed.  The characters were well developed, the plot was riveting, and it was a definite page turner.  I would highly recommend this quick read to anyone.  The only disappointment will probably be the comparison of movie to book."
"I give it 3 stars ONLY  because it was well written. This lady can write! But it fell flat to me Rachel got on my last nerves being a stupid, weak drunk. I guessed ""WHODONEIT"" but finished  it to see if I  was right and I was. I found it predictable and not very suspenseful. This book came highly recommended to me and I had high expectations, but I feel like I got it on with a two minute brother."
"After months of seeing/hearing friends talk about this book, I finally got a copy to read. This book is so amazing, I read it in a day and a half. I could not put it down! The characters are incredibly complex and just when you think you've got them figured out, a new twist comes in. The writing style is fantastic as well. You truly feel as if you are in the characters shoes when reading. I can't wait for the movie now!!"
"This is an excellent whodunnit - of the type where you flip each page on to the next entry - it is a bit reminiscent of 'Gone Girl' and much of the story is a drunkalog , but it has some magic to it. In all fairness, each of the three women sound like each other. And the sudden conversion of the main character is more suspension of disbelief than I can muster. But she, like the cavalry, appears in time and rides to the rescue. Grab a cold drink, swing your legs in the water while you delve in to 'The Girl on the Train.'"
"Rachel was a drunk. Her character did unbelievable things, as in, not believable. Anna was self absorbed, unfeeling. Megan, ruined, broken, boring. One interesting twist but delivered in a skim the pages way. A book is good to me if I can't skip pages. I could skip whole chapters, so, so so, ho hum. Don't see what all the fuss was about. Despicable unmemorable characters. Maybe if I cared more for at least one of the characters, it would have been better."
"This was a good little fiction novel and a super quick read. I bought it in hopes to have it read before I saw the movie and was able to, no problem. I finished it in one sitting of about 5-6 hours. It was engaging and interesting and just what I was hoping for as a break from textbooks <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0089> I'll definitely check out more of her books!"
"Bought this book for my daughter to read on the plane on her way to vacation in Puerto Rico.  She loved it!!  Read it on the plane, beach and every quite moment she had.  Came home raving as much about the book as she did about the trip!  Great book!  She passed it on to a friend and already has plans to see the movie this summer.  Although she was disappointed that the casting of the movie didm't fit how she imagined the characters (but what else is new!)  still a Great Book!  Get it!"
"Found myself becoming a bit disappointed when I realized there were only about 30 pages left, I didn't want it to stop! Very well written, could not put it down, I needed to know what was going to happen. Paula Hawkins is one of my new favorite writers, would definitely read more of her work.Not so dark as Gillian Flynn (who I love to read) but seems quite similar to me."
"I read this book in ONE weekend...and I have a toddler.  It is the definition of a page turner.  It is told from 3 sets of views.  Rachel is the main character.  She is a young woman living a life of lies.  Her alcoholism cost her marriage, job and dream life.  To keep up appearances, she rides the train to the job she no longer holds.  She takes this opportunity to watch the house her ex husband and new wife live in.  She also becomes obsessed with the neighbors, Jess, a few houses down.  She make believes a life for them and creates a story surrounding the beautiful woman and her husband.  Her obsessive nature leads to several run ins with her ex husband and his new wife and former mistress, Anna.  After an alcohol filled night she discovers Jess is missing and she has no  recollection of the night.  All she knows is that she was on that street and had an altercation with Anna.  It is a gripping page turner and about the time you think you have it figured out... guess again!"
"I rated this book four stars because it was kind of confusing at the beginning trying to keeping track of the characters. Once you get the characters clear in your mind, the story flowed along in a coherent manner. The twists and turns kept you wondering. I loved the suspense. I recommend this book to anyone who likes mystery novels."
"A good read from the first page.  It is a mystery.  It begins with a divorced women, who takes a commuter train to work each day.  The train goes by her former home on the way.  She observes the changes the new wife makes.  At the same time, she uncovers an unusual mystery by observing other couples on the block.  The story is told from each characters' point of view."
"Girl on the Train is rated as a No1 best seller currently, in our local book stores. I certainly enjoyed the read especially as I was looking for an easy albeit well written read while on holiday recently. It certainly did not disappoint. I do not believe in giving away the story line when commenting so suffice it to say that it receives my 4 star recommendation."
"The novel is written with the interesting strategy of moving from the mind of one woman to another of the three whose lives are intertwined in unfortunate ways.  I was confused by that at first and couldn't get a sense of what was going on or how I was supposed to interpret this.  But in time, the connection of each to the others began to gel and then I was in.  The characters are interesting and dark in different ways and the actions of each has affected the lives of the other two in devastating ways although none of them knows the others very well.  The suspense grows toward the end as you begin to realize that you're finally going to find out just who did what and the climax was riveting.  I wouldn't have recommend it while reading the first several chapters but I hung with it and I'm glad I did.  Worth reading and the story continues to haunt me a little bit days later after finishing it."
It's so hard to find a good suspense novel that doesn't fall apart at the end or has dull characters or is a page-turner initially and devolves into stupidity at the end -- I've read so many highly-touted suspense novels lately that were so disappointing!  The Girl on the Train delivers!! I can't wait to see the movie coming out in October.
Poorly written;  no likeable characters.
I am amazed that a book like this one rose to the top of the best seller list.  It wasn't even entertainment for me.  I made myself read it to the end to see if I would change my opinion.  I did not.
"Knock off of, ""Gone Girl,"" except not as good. The description of the book sounded so good! And it got such great reviews. The book was written okay, however I couldn't invest myself in the characters and was often confused as I often felt like I missed something because information was left out. The main character isn't likeable which made the book even worse. Waste of time."
"I don't understand what the hype is about this book. Prior to reading this book, I had read several reviews that it is comparable to Gone Girl, an excellent book, so I was really excited to read it. It is in no way similar to Gone Girl. The characters are completely pathetic, the pace is extremely slow and the outcome was predictable. Two other ladies read this book with me and all three of us have the same consensus that this book was a waste of time and totally boring."
"Although I found this story quite predictable, I did appreciate the twists & turns that it took. This book reads a lot like Gone Girl, with a similar format and intertwined story line; however, I found it less complex and not quite as exciting. This book was a very quick read - only took me a day! - so it's great to bring along for a beach day in the Summer or a longer flight. I would re-read the story again, just wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be."
"I don't want to give anything away so I will keep this review brief. This is a great mystery read. I couldn't put the book down once I started reading it. The author does an amazing job describing the scenery without going over the top. Same with the characters. The flow is steady and there are a few twists and turns, I wasn't able to guess who until the end."
Interesting at first.  Became a bit tedious and unrealistic as it progressed.  Really-an ex wife walks off with your baby and no one calls the police and they continue to allow her to the house?  It just because. So implausible that it lost its entertainment value.  I also wasn't expecting it to be go dark and depressing.
"It was hard to follow in the beginning-had to go back to previous chapters repeatedly to get the characters straight.  But once the characters have been established on this reader's mind, it was a page-turning novel with surprising twists!  I like how the author developed the plot and the built up the characters, which was superb!"
"I have heard so much positive buzz about TGOTT, but I could only get moderately invested in this London-based story.  Some reviewers have snobbishly poo-pooed it as being ""ok if you're one of those people who thought Gone Girl was a great book.""  I loved Gone Girl, but these characters never pulled me into their lives or their psyches the way Gillian Flynn's Amy and Nick did.  TGOTT was just okay for me.  I'm glad I bought the deeply discounted $6.99 Kindle version."
"I put off buying this book because my husband always whines if I buy books written by women since he reads everything I buy and usually hates the 'female' point of view--.but this time--I read the book in an afternoon and evening and he decided to give it a try.  I thought maybe he'd hate it--it's first person ""female""...but he loved it--I totally lost him for the evening as he was engrossed from page one.The story is a sad one in many ways--especially if you or anyone close to you has an issue with addiction.  Simply reading the book can put you off alcohol for awhile.  The characters ring true--you ache for the main character and feel her confusion and fear.  I usually can figure out the 'who done it' by the time I'm a third of the way through most any mystery, but this one kept me guessing and even when I guessed right I didn't want to believe it.Fast paced--the kind of book you fall into and don't want to put down.  And--for all the men who fear women writers for their sentimentality--this is the perfect read."
Fantastic read.  I hope the upcoming movie does it justice.  It kept me guessing until a long way into the book.  This book definitely was told in a perfect alternating perspective method and reminded me a lot of Gone Girl (which I loved).  I would definitely recommend that my friends read this book before watching the upcoming movie...as ruining the ending would probably ruin the whole book experience.
"The ending ruined this book for me.  I compared it to Lost - I enjoyed it all the way till the end, and then was furious for wasting my time.  I enjoyed reading it waiting for the ""woah, I didn't see that coming"" moment, but it turns out the ending was the exact obvious ending you did see coming from the beginning.  There were also some things that didn't make sense to me at all - things that were critical to the story, but not realistic/practical at all.  I found myself saying ""Really?  Come on, that makes no sense and is so obviously trying to force the ending"".  It was a quick read and some mindless entertainment initially, and since I mostly read it on my commute which is dead time anyway, I wasn't as pissed as I could have been.  I was pissed about the time I spent reading this at home when I could have been doing something more productive or entertaining."
"This is the kind of predictable downer you just expect after the success of GONE GIRL. After all the descriptions of the decrepit train to London, made-up words used more than once (juddering,I think), I thought, what's next ""scuddering across the sky""? Give her a few hundred pages, it's there. Very little suspense or imagination if you ask me. Maybe I just don't like the genre?"
"Each character was developed very well. The beginning was actually very slow for me, but it didn't take long for it to grab my interest and hold onto it for the rest of the book.  The writer framed the whodunnit aspect to where you never figured it out until the end of the book. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys suspenseful books and movies."
"This murder mystery held my attention and interest more than many similar novels.  It reminded me a good deal of ""Gone Girl,"" so if you liked that, you'll probably like this.  It is narrated in the first person by three separate women.  My only complaint was that all three female characters seemed in many ways similar to each other - probably the author's intent, but it it just kind of bothered me that they all seemed more or less like the same person.  It's still a good read."
"While I don't particularly like a diary format to a novel, this allowed the reader to be able to see the different points of view of the major characters. The main character had to work out her own issues with depression and alcoholism to be able to attempt a normal life. Her imagery of the people's lives outside the train lent for an interesting murder mystery, all the way to the end."
"Although I have not read ""Gone Girl,"" the story contained within ""The Girl on the Train"" is very reminiscent of that story--thrilling, gripping, mysterious, unsettling. As soon as you wrap your mind around the world the author has developed, you will be hooked. As the characters begin to interact, the plot twists and turns in unexpected ways that will more than likely leave you reading this book within a minimum of 24 hours. I literally purchases this book last night before falling asleep, read it for 4 hours, woke up, read it for another 4 hours, and was blown away by its resolution. A must read for anyone who loves a story with a good twist."
"This is the first time I have read a book where I have truly disliked all of the characters until nearly the very end. Readers will appreciate the characters' development if they stick it out. Despite my dislike for the characters, the story kept me engaged and wanting to know what would happen next. I'm always pleased when the author does a good job at misleading you about the ending."
"I had heard so much about ""The Girl on the Train"" & had recently seen the preview for the movie. I decided that I had to read it before the movie came out! I was not disappointed. An easy read, yet not one that you get bored with. I had a feeling of who the ""other man"" was from the beginning, and was right. Was still kept guessing about things throughout the whole book though!"
"I usually read Sci-Fi and Fantasy, with quick jumps into literature and non-fiction for a break to get an idea of what is happening in the literary world.Didn't know what to expect with this book, but the idea of unreliable narrator is always fascinating; and this book pulls it off with great aplomb.The pathos that the author is able to generate for the 'main' narrator (there are three viewpoints in this book') is impressive. I actually felt sorry and disgusted for her, in equal parts.Caveat : I never liked Ignatius in Confedarcy of Dunces, just didn't do it for me - but this worked.It's a gripping read, fast paced. Just a really well told yarn.And if, IF, anyone cares, yes, the three viewpoints are all female; but this is in no way a 'female' oriented book. It is just a good story, told in an interesting way"
"The best thing about the book was that it did become very interesting in the last three chapters.  The most difficult part of the book was keeping the timeline and the characters straight. As a result, I had a difficult time finishing the book. Nevertheless, I try to finish a book club book so I can reasonably participate in the discussion. All of the characters are desperately flawed. It seems so unlikely to have so many dysfunctional people in one plot. If one is willing to suspend that disbelief, the outcome is, perhaps, less surprising. Therefore, I found it to be tedious even to the end. I am still surprised that the detectives, who had been so suspicious of everyone, were so willing to let the culprits go with only one standing up for the other. There was no reason for them to let them go without further investigation. Perhaps the story would take on a completely different aspect if told from the point of view from the detectives. As an English teacher, I would love to hear my students reconstruct the plot from the various points of view!  Fascinating idea!"
"Creatively crafted. Good mystery - very. I don't want to give it away, though I feel myself slipping. It was far more satisfying than the novel I previously read by another author. Mysteries are to be solved! No need for a neat and tidy resolution. It shouldn't be all safe and predictable, but don't strand me like hapless untethered astronaut on a space walk. It resembles a Gillian Flynn title, but not nearly as edgy - definitely aspiring if not quite so accomplished. Nonetheless, very worthwhile read."
"The first few pages pulled me in; the way the characters or at least the central female characters each got a turn to ""talk"".  I connected with them even if I would not want to be their friend.  The personality of many of these characters frustrated me to no end as one is an alcoholic - and all are self-involved - but then I would imagine the portrayal of the alcoholic was true-to-life.  I know it is with the self-involved individuals.It was interesting to see how deeply you can be involved in someone’s life without actually knowing that person.  It speaks to our voyeur society and the interconnection of events through our life.The end was not predictable although someone might argue that it was wrapped up a bit too smoothly.  I still had questions at the end – so everything was not answered to my satisfaction.Regardless, it was never boring and the pace is fast.  I would like to have another book this minute that would entertain me as this one did."
"The story kept me on the edge of my seat. Paula Hawkins is a truly gifted writer. Her writing is so vivid I felt that I was riding the train,every bump and stop. The story takes so many turns. I really feel like I know what an alcoholic goes through the craving. The shame the confusion and the helplessness.  Thank you for writing one of the best books I've ever read."
"This book has been a best seller for some weeks now and for good reason.  I think it's because the telling of the story goes well beyond the basic premise: three women making very bad choices and being victimized by men who are exposed for the rats they are.  Not much new or exciting there.  But what Hawkins does with it is a gem.  The story unfolds as they do in many really good books and the reader is carried along effortlessly.  What is truly unique about the work is how the perspectives of three narrators appeared to me.  Reading the story and seeing it develop was like watching a jig saw puzzle being put together.  But it was like I was seeing it being assembled on a glass pane and I was standing on the back side of the glass.  Each of the three narrative characters has a hand in the puzzle and Hawkins does an amazing job of letting them emerge as independent persons. At first they seemed so similar, but by the end each was clearly recognizable.  It is a truly good book written by a highly skilled storyteller that is limited only by its somewhat uninspired basic premise."
The pacing of this book is exceptional. The Girl on the Train sets a new standard for page turners. The author achieves a consistent internal conversational in the mind of the three female leads. The only flaw in this book is the author did not create three different characters. The author is alive in all three minds. She should have created three distinct characters.
"Such a brilliant novel. I can relate to many things from different characters in one way or another. The stretch of the story line is in the perfect pace that drag you in to the final reveal of the mystery. The author has such a precise and real analysis of each character that you'd believe this kind of story could happen to any one, to people around you or yourself."
"I really enjoyed reading this book. The characters were introduced, and expanded in chapters within the book.It is basically a physicological thriller and the mystery of how the murder happened doesnt come together until the last chapters.I will eagerly await the next book by this authour, and hope it will be as gripping as ""The Girl on the Train""... Adele Ford."
This is the most depressing book I have ever read - not a person in the whole book with a redeeming quality except the baby and maybe the roommate but she was dumb for putting up with her. A main character who inspired no feelings in me but annoyance. I only finished the book because I paid full price for it. I can't believe this is on the best seller list. What is wrong with people.
Interesting story. Somewhat difficult to follow story because the time line switches often between the characters. All the characters were interesting but had very flawed personalities. The conclusion was rather unexpected until very close to the end. The book is worth the read and I would recommend it to those with the patience to follow the alternating time lines..
Interesting character and development of them. Sometimes a little to much depth going back into the past.  Figured out some parts along the way. Glad I read prior to seeing the movie
"So many people raved about this book but I was more than disappointed.  It was something like reading an afternoon soap opera, can't imagine how it became a best seller......must be me.  Have to admit I finished the book, it captured enough of my interest to be curious about the ending....not that it was a big surprise."
"What happened to an intriguing plot? Why was this book published? The characters were relatively flat and mostly unlikable. I feel like I just wasted several hours of my life reading this book. The writing wasn't terrible but it wasn't great, either. I got no satisfaction out of this story. Nothing like Gone Girl in terms of a (somewhat) satisfying story."
"Started off annoyed by the weakness of the female protagonists, but was very glad I finished it. Wonderful twists and turns. Can't wait to watch the movie now."
"The book is a good, fast read. It doesn't quite live up to the hype--while well written, when all is said and done there is nothing particularly unique about it--but is still worth checking out.The characters are interesting although you could argue not a single one is likable. The killer is also fairy predictable, though how things will unfold isn't quite so much."
I think I'm the one in one hundred people that was not impressed with this book.  I just wanted someone to get this woman to rehab and get a good psychiatrist for her. When my Kindle said I was 50% done I was glad because I was sure the only good parts of this book was coming at the end. I do think however this will make a good movie.
"I was intrigued by the summary of this book that it was going to be a big thriller I couldn't put down, instead I was disappointed to basically just read about a drunk divorced, obsessive woman  who rides the train everyday who conjures up characters for people she sees while sitting on the train.  She is obsessed with her exhusband who cheated on her as well as his wife and baby.  The entire mystery of the person who becomes missing is predictable as well as the outcome.  I was very disappointed to say the least."
"In my opinion this is a good view of the life of an alcoholic that is at the stage of believing they do not need help, sometimes the story runs slow and as is to be expected from looking at the life of an alcoholic going downhill it can be frustrating.I think the murder trama is well built and the outcome is not obvious.  A good read."
This is a very well written and easy story to read. A page turning psychological thriller that builds steadily towards a satisfying conclusion where empowerment is discovered and self esteem returns. There seemed to be an unlikely hole in the plot where one of the protagonists is telling her story seconds before she's killed in a forest. That bothered me. The male characters are also a little one dimensional and predictable. Nevertheless a great read on the beach!
"It only took me 2 days to read this book.  I found it very entertaining for the most part.  The story is told through the point of view of 3 different characters.  None of these women are very likable.  I personally enjoyed that, but I can see why that would bother some people.  I did figure out the ending about 50 pages in.  It was still a fun read!"
I read this for my book club .The dates in th beginning took some getting used to and I had to go back and forth for a while to make sure I got the timing. It was a bit disturbing but I found myself dying to finish so I could know what happened.
"I was really looking forward to reading this book and pre-ordered it. I was disappointed because there were a few chapters when I felt the story didn't progress. The narrator continues to think the same thoughts and the story doesn't build.That being said, it was not obvious to me how the story was going to turn out or who the ""bad guy"" was. It does draw you in and make you want to find out ""who done it"".Overall it was ok, but I recommend Gillian Flynn's Dark Places over this book."
"Don't let the beginning of this story stop you from keeping reading.  It starts out slow, but good heavens, does it get GOOD!  You'll be shocked!"
"I know this book has been wildly popular but, while I enjoyed the ending, I felt it was painfully slow for the first 2/3s of the book. Also, I never got to a point where I cared about any of the characters. I should have some sympathy for a woman so depressed over her infertility that she turned to drink. And I should certainly cross my fingers in hopes that a missing girl is not dead but ....sorry"
"This book was remeniscent of two goodies: Gone Girl and Strangers on a Train. I don't say it very often, but this was a book I could not put down. Okay, so I had the ""bad guy"" figured out about half way through, but only because I was really trying to figure it out. :) Characters and dates change out from chapter to chapter, so you kind of have to pay attention, because the timelines are important. But it was entertaining and engaging and a really good ride."
"Although Rachel is the protagonist and driving force moving the story along, I enjoyed reading the different women's perspectives throughout the story. The main reason I enjoyed them is because it helped me to continue questioning where the narrative was going and how it was getting there, especially since Rachel is at times a very unreliable narrator.for full review visit: http://foldedpagesdistillery.blogspot.com/2015/08/the-girl-on-train.html"
"I couldn't put this book down. I write suspense, and thought I had it figured out. My Dad was a detective and I majored in psych. I knew what to look for, the red herrings, the clues. But still this book kept me guessing until the very end. Excellent attention to detail and control of her plot. I'll definitely read this author again."
"I loved how the story was told through 3 characters eyes. It was suspenseful,and at times had you rooting for and against the characters."
"For a book with so much buzz around it, I have to say I was terribly disappointed.I enjoyed the first person narration and that all three of the narrators were unreliable, but I thought it was depressing for the sake of being depressing. I thought the ending was weak and rushed and lacked resolution.There were some grammatical errors, which, to be honest, in an international bestseller, I found extremely disappointing.Overall, a disappointing read"
"The writing is great, the mystery is mysterious and I can see this becoming another blockbuster a la Gone Girl. It's just that the characters are so dysfunctional and maladjusted that it gets awfully depressing at time. That makes you want to put it away and turn to something lighter. And yet, you keep returning and turning the pages because some miserable demon inside you wants to know if these idiots find redemption in the end. Not really."
"I won't go into the plot and storyline, but the story is told from the perspective of 3 different women.  I realized early on that I hadn't been keeping track of who was narrating and the timeline and had to go back a get reoriented.  Even though none of the characters is really likable, I enjoyed the story and look forward to the movie."
"I would have given this five stars except for the similar first person characters, so much alike that I couldn't tell them apart. The plot MOVES. No doubt about it. I literally couldn't put the book down, and it takes A LOT for me as a novelist and book editor to lose myself to that extent in a story. But I found the voices of the characters so similar, I often had to thumb back to the beginning of the sections to see which character's ""head"" I was in. But all in all, this was a dynamic read."
"The storyline is just brilliant. Character development is amazing too. However, the book picks up pace only after half way mark. It would be interesting to watch movies adapted to this one."
"If you liked ""Gone Girl,"" then you will enjoy this book.  Creepy, edgy feel to the book as you progressed through the chapters that keep you coming back for more.  Really well written even though it jumps back and forth between characters and their point of view.  It catches your attention from the beginning and has an ending you won't see coming! Great book!"
"This is a story of a young woman's fight with alcohol and the means she uses to escape her demons. The story made me feel as thogh I was living her fears and sharing her vivid imagination. The tale become a tangled web of deception and lies but through it all our heroine finds redemption and resolves to start life anew in a different placeI enjoyed the writing, the story, and the different approach to solving an addiction and a need to feel worthy againGood story.. ."
It was an interesting read.  Had a good twist for the ending. I have recommended it to another friend already.
"I personally couldn't get into the read of this story.I attempted to follow the girl on the train making up others lives but, to me boring read.Never finished it"
"The Girl on the Train is an intriguing story  of love, betrayal and tangled lives told from the perspective of three women whose lives become entwined.  It is an engaging, page turning read."
"I thought this was a fantastic psychological thriller that had me guessing throughout the book!  I enjoyed it very much and look forward to the movie to soon be released.  My girlfriends and I read the book together and then discussed the plot, the characters and the possible endings at every twist.  It was a fun book to read as a group and discuss.  I would highly recommend it for book clubs!"
"I get so frustrated when I see books compared to ""Gone Girl"" as this one was in some reviews I'd seen because ""Gone Girl"" was one of the most over-rated pieces of crap I had read in recent memory.This is nothing at all like it!  You hate the main character because her flaws are so intense, but you can't help but root for her. It's a gift to be able to write like that.  Suspense all the way through, but frustration in equal measures - frustration not at the author - the book is very well-written - but frustration because you want to slap some of the characters and get them to do something else.  It's like watching a television program and yelling at the TV to get the characters to do something different.  I found myself doing that quite a bit here.In the end, I didn't see it coming.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Won't give anything away, but this is a page-turner worth sitting down with for an afternoon.  I think it took me just that long because I couldn't bear to not finish it in one sitting."
"This book is terrific from 1st page to the last!!! The characters are so well developed, and the author switches from one to the other very smoothly. The main character is a woman named Rachel, and it is she who rides the train everyday, giving the reader a bird's eye view of what she sees, and what she imagines about the people that she sees everyday. Her imagination takes over reality, but we soon find out that the real lives of these people are much worse than what she imagined for them. We also get to know Rachel, and all about her sad battle with alcohol, and also her ex-husband and his new wife, who are prominent characters in the book. The book is never boring, and these people are so interesting, and so complex, that you just feel compelled to keep reading. It is definitely thrilling, and the moodiness of the grey weather in England is the perfect background for the story."
"I had purchased this over a year ago and somehow did not read it.  Often with multiple characters narrated I find it difficult to keep them straight.  This was not the case.  Each character was strong and memorable.  The suspense was there until the very end and all the loose ends were tied in.  Loved it, hated for it to end and now I want to see the movie."
"This book was fantastic, I loved and hated all of the characters and was so anxious at the end of each section to find out what happened next that if I'd had the time I probably could have read the whole thing in one sitting. The tone was very dark and the twist wasn't particularly shocking but was delivered in a way that made you realize the clues were there the whole time. One of the rare books that I want to read again right away and I can't wait to see the upcoming movie adaptation!"
"I absolutely loved this book! It was my first ebook and was such a quick read, but in a good way - I couldn't put it down! Firstly I loved the London setting. I'm a huge anglophile and loved the inserts of British culture - they just seemed natural, nothing forced. (Of course the character's voices in my head had perfect suburban London accents.) I thought the writing was brilliant. The characters were dreadful people, but yet so relatable. I'm sure we can all find whispers of their traits in us, which is what kept me reading. ""What will __ do now?"" And I couldn't help but picture everything so vividly in my head, the settings so clear and concrete. I hope this gets made into a movie!The book is laid out from the perspectives of 3 different women, but it flows so well so it's not confusing. It's kind of similar to Gone Girl in that way, but I actually thought Gone Girl was a little too disjointed. I think this book does a better job at the seamless transitions. The plot twists are also great. I found myself gasping out loud multiple times - it was a great suspenseful read. I will definitely read more from this author!"
I had to pay full  Amazon price for this as the movie version is about to be shown. Therefore I was going to be fastidious in my critique. But there was nothing to be critical of; the book is excellent. I will say that I had about run  out of empathy for the continued self inflicted problems of Rachel but even that was solved at story's end. Truly excellent!
"This book is a great read for all the reasons that make a good mystery addictive: tight narrative, characters you learn to care about, a flawed protagonist struggling against the odds to solve the case and, of course, the who done it factor.If you read this book and like it, I also recommend ""The Paying Guests"" by Sarah Waters.  Equally intriguing but much higher sex content."
"The story has three men who are all evil in some way, and all the female character's problems are somehow a product of the evil created by the two men in the story. I was really excited about reading this book as it was compared it to Gone Girl. The main character is pathetic in every way (thanks to the men in the story, I'm sure if asked, the author would say the main character had a horrible father as well,) I love the ENDING where, the main character is running away from a noise she heard in the bushes, showing how she's now paranoid and traumatized by her ex boyfriend, and then it just ends. I hated this book."
"I had to slog through this book just to finish this, I thought surely there must be something spectacular at the end but there wasn't. So repetitive and boring and just like the trains rolling down the tracks.  Generally I can read a good book of 500 plus pages in 4 days, but it took 3 weeks because I kept falling asleep. So if you suffer from  insomnia get this book it will cure it otherwise skip it."
"I was told this book was on par with ""Gone Girl,"" with which I strongly disagree. The plot was nowhere near as masterfully twisted. I wasn't pulling my hair out while reading this, lamenting how terrible it was... but I wouldn't say I particularly enjoyed it. The subject matter was kind of depressing (an alcoholic divorcee who cannot keep it together and another young woman who goes missing), and by the end, I kind of hated every one of the characters."
Excellent read!
"The plot of the book is interesting and so are the characters. I didn't want to put it down. What I liked best, though, is that I learned more about alcoholism and about the impact of extreme inebriation on the individual.  The main character in the book learns in a way that is integral to the storyline that, when a person is extremely drunk, the person does not form memories and therefore cannot later recall what happened. It's not the same old plot line I've read many times before, so I enjoyed it."
"I thought this novel was amazing! I read it in two days but easily could have read it in one had I not needed to attend work for nearly 10 hours :) . For me, the story was intriguing and I was constantly reevaluating how I felt about the characters as more and more information was given. It was fast paced and I didn't find myself ""skipping"" over text because it was boring. If you like suspenseful, mind messing stories...this one's for you."
"Rachel is someone that you feel bad for, but that you also get frustrated with for not getting control of her life.  Anna appears to be playing the role of a martyr, but you also get annoyed that she willingly ruins their marriage. Megan has issues too so being sensitive for her is also hard.  How they all play in this twist of events does keep you intrigued."
"Refreshingly different way to tell a story.  Held my interest and provided some surprises, twists and turns.  I enjoyed the 'darkness' of the main character and was engaged in her plights.  The writing is direct and easy to read - it's not 'literature' or sophisticated or something that stays with you after finishing the book - it rises slightly above the rest of the quick easy-read stuff published today."
"Wow! This is a very different type of book. You go into it not really knowing what to expect except, it has something to do with ""a girl on a train."" It has a lot of twist & turns and surprises. The main character Rachel, is telling the tale of her sad & broken life. It gets more intense,chilling & complex as it goes. Full speed ahead! Real entertaining. Read it in no time."
"The concept was good but the author chose to dwell on Rachel's drunkenness a little bit too much. It became tedious quickly. The story was complicated with characters sleeping with each other's husbands or wives. An interesting book,yes. But it did not quite hit the mark."
"Plot-driven novels are fun, like chocolate cake and roller coasters.  I read this book on a Kindle, swiping through the pages addictively, forgetting to look up even though I was riding along the southern California coast on a sunny day.The charming thing about the book is the protagonist's growth along the way to solving the mystery.  She may make some horrid errors, but the reader pulls for her throughout the sometimes contrived journey."
"I enjoyed the book, and have since seen the film. I found both a little confusing at times, as I had to keep going back to beginning of some chapters to remember who I was reading about..(could be just me though) Well worth the read, and would possibly be advisable to have read  the book before watching the movie, but not a must."
Once I got use to the different characters going back and forth I did really well.  It was a thrill and a great mystery.  It kept you in suspense until the end.  The kind of mystery that I love to curl up in my chair and get lost in.  Once I started I could not put it down.  My daughter was listening to it on tape at the same time.  I can not wait for the movie to come out!!
"This book's main character is an alcoholic.  Like her roommate Cathy, I wanted to shake her and tell her to straighten up.  Seeing the world through her eyes, it was hard to know what to believe, and as the murder unfolds, I didn't care much for the victim or her bereaved spouse,neither.  I was thoroughly engrossed until 1/2 through, then cause I didn't really feel invested in any of the main characters, I was just ready to finish the book and figure out the mystery."
"It was hard for me to put this book down. I really wanted to know how it all ended. However, I grew increasingly frustrated with the main character. Her problem with not remembering things dragged on and on. She got kind of annoying. She redeems herself in the end which was rewarding. I really liked the writing, it kept me engaged."
"I enjoyed this book because it kept me interested.  When I had to leave it, I was looking forward to coming back to see what was coming next.  I will now be renting the movie.  I always like to read the book before I watch the movie.  Good book! I am glad I spent the time to read it and I am glad I purchased it."
An interesting novel worth reading.  This writer found it a bit slow in the first third of the story being narrated by 5 different characters but as the story unfolds builds to an exciting ending.  The characterization is very real told as though the reader is actually in the mind of the character of the moment.
"The story itself is well written however, I was thoroughly sick of the main character's drinking problems. Aside from that, the only thing I didn't like about this story was the fact that the characters were unlikable people, every single one of them. The ending does have a good twist which I enjoyed. It would depend upon the person I was talking to whether or not I'd recommend this book. If it's just a good story you're after and you don't mind the characters all being pathetic, then I would say read and enjoy."
"After seeing someone reading this on a plane, decided to give it a try.  Confused writing, confused characters, way over developed details leading very slowly to an attempted twist ending.  It feels like a first attempt at writing edited by teachers that want to encourage a young writer without hurting their feelings.Hopefully others will not waste their money or time on this dull story."
Glad I read the book first and then the movie.
A complicated story with multiple characters and time lines interwoven throughout.  The author does an excellent job of making the main character very annoying and unlikable while building to a somewhat predictable conclusion.  Older folks who have read and seen Hitchcock will catch on quickly.  Keeps you engaged!
"This story is told in first person by three different women and Ms. Hawkins does a great job of making each one interesting and distinctly different from the others.  The story is well crafted but somewhat grim and the ending is a little too tidy, especially for Rachel - the titular Girl on a Train.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book and recommend it as a good summer beach read.  I probably won't remember I read it in 10 years - but not every book needs to be mind altering literature."
"A great read. It starts slowly and I had to pick up the book three times before I got through the first 50 pages. After the 50 page barrier, I was hooked and didn't stop reading until the very end. The ending is good, but not quite up to the riveting story that starts after the first fifty pages. Definitely a good vacation book. Can't wait until author's next book."
"Ms Hawkins has a problem here, but one that the publishers are happy to exploit - Gone Girl.There were always going to be comparisons, but the marketing opportunity was enormous, and it was taken advantage of. In fact, one has to wonder, ""What was the original title of the manuscript?""Standing on its own feet, it's not a bad read. Not the page turner various reviews had me expecting, it plodded along in sections, and wasn't helped by the stilted writing. Trains trundle more than once, sunlight is burnished, knuckles white on wheels... we've all read it more than once.  Given the structure, more adept character development was called for, along with stronger, more distinct voices. It was difficult to invest too much in the main character, and the men came across more as projections than flesh and blood.Having said all that, it would make for a decent read on the train to and from work.Probably safer than looking out the window, in Ms Hawkins' world."
"So many people raved about this book but I was more than disappointed.  It was something like reading an afternoon soap opera, can't imagine how it became a best seller......must be me.  Have to admit I finished the book, it captured enough of my interest to be curious about the ending....not that it was a big surprise."
A complicated story with multiple characters and time lines interwoven throughout.  The author does an excellent job of making the main character very annoying and unlikable while building to a somewhat predictable conclusion.  Older folks who have read and seen Hitchcock will catch on quickly.  Keeps you engaged!
"I'm not one to post warnings for books and usually think people old enough to buy adult fiction should be capable of separating fact and fantasy, but this book- wow.. The hype about this novel is everywhere and so many reviewers rave about it,  so- to be honest- I purchased it without really knowing much more than it was about a missing woman, told through the narrative of a woman on the train. This is entirely my responsibility, but this book is hard to read.It is a page turner, to be sure.  I read it over the course of a few days, staying up far later than I should have, and sneaking pages wherever I could. I didn't particularly like it though- there are no sympathetic characters, and I felt vaguely sick each time I read.  I should've seen where it was going before I did.  I guessed early on who the ""bad-guy"" was, but didn't anticipate the level of psychologically terrifying domestic abuse and gas-lighting the author has the men in this novel heap on the 3 female narrators."
I really enjoyed this book and definitely recommend it. The personality of the characters is continuously developed so that there are interesting plot twists all over the book. I am not giving a full 5 star because I thought the ending (despite being quite unique and unexpected) was a little rushed and didn't feel as psychologically refined as the rest of the book.
"This story was difficult for me to get into at first, but since it was our book group book I was committed to finishing it, and I'm glad I did. The reason I couldn't get into it initially was because I didn't care for the main character. She seemed weak and foolish and drank too much alcohol. But about a quarter into the book, when I realized why she was so weak, I felt sorry for her--which is always a draw for me. Then I had to know how the story ended.I suspected who the real ""bad"" person was in the story quickly, but for a long time I thought two characters were the same person. The author didn't give them enough unique and separate characteristics so they sounded the same.I really loved how this story shows us that things are never as they appear. The girl on the train thinks she sees something, but life is way more complicated than what you see at first glance. This story was a great reminder of that.If you have trouble with intense thrillers, you might have to put this book down toward the end to take breathing breaks."
"It was a fine book. Had enough plot twists and red herrings to keep you interested and guessing. I was disappointing by the final plot twist as I was able to predict it since the second chapter.Written chapter by chapter in different view points, I was disappointed that the voices from each character had such little variation from one another.The main character was very well done as we are able to see her struggle and give an accurate depiction of the internal processes of alcoholism. However, I felt like some of the main characters were to inconsistent to be taken seriously and be believable.Over all its an acceptable thriller. I'm not sure if it's completely deserving of all the hype it's been receiving, but yeah. If you want to feel like you're up to date and part of a book fad, pick it up. It won't kill you."
"For a book it was okay. The ending was some what of a let down, happened to fast. Although Rachel figured out what was going on between the deceased the and culprit there was no/know coherence. That may be the wrong usage of the word. When I saw the previews of the upcoming movie I thought perhaps the movie might be better then the book. But now I do not think so."
"This book fell somewhere between pretty good and okay. I didn't think it lived up to all the hype. I read the book consistently but it definitely wasn't a book I couldn't put down. In fact, I wanted to be done with it so I could move on to a better book. That said, I did want to finish it to know what happens in the end. I'm glad I did finish it. The last few chapters were my favorite and I liked the ending which was rewarding for sticking with it. I had a little trouble following the characters at the beginning because there's some skipping around. The writing was good but didn't blow me away."
"Read it for a book club. Not my kind of book. Don't enjoy this genre, so I don't know how it compares to similar books, but it seemed well-written and drew me in. Would still prefer to read fantasy, but it was good for what it was. I don't know if reading more books in this genre would make this one seem predictable."
"I liked it, but I have a feeling I would have liked it more if I hadn't read Gone Girl yet. You can tell the author was playing on those same strings, just a different chord."
"This was a fun read and a rather intriguing story! If you liked ""Gone Girl,"" this story is very similar --- I would have liked it to be more original. But I loved the London setting and British characters - very accurate!Frustratingly, I found about half a dozen typos ... Surprising for a longtime bestseller out of a major publishing house."
"Terrible story, terrible characters, and just plain awful. I didn't care about anyone and didn't care what happened. I don't know how this book got on any best seller's list. I kept hoping it would get better. Ugh. I just can't recommend this book to anyone and I'm not sure I want to give it away because I don't want anyone to know I read it. Save your money."
"While this was no ""Gone Girl,"" the book was very entertaining. The twist became somewhat predictable towards the middle of the book, but you still had the ""who done it"" vibe going on because you were not quite sure. I do like the way the main character, Rachel, is developed through the story. We don't often have black-out drunk, unreliable narrators, which was a nice change of pace. I wasn't sure to believe what she was saying as much as she was unsure of herself."
"I hated this book.  Could not wait to for it to end.  Why did I not  just toss it when I realized I did not like it?  Well that's just me, once I start something I have to finish it.  Anyhow, I just couldn't stand any of the characters.  Without a connection to anyone, it was worse than one of my boring college textbooks."
Wow when I got to the end of this book I was left liked wow…WTF. I was left wanted something more for Rachel after all she had been through but I was glad to have been able to get some closure for her. I enjoyed how we got bits and pieces that made the story come together. I will admit there was times I was biased towards one character but in the end I was able to get past that and really enjoy the story without letting my feelings get the best of me. This was a fun book club read that I enjoyed discussing.
A good read as I  read on. However. perhaps is only me. I found it difficult I initially trying to keep up with the various characters. Then it all started to come together.Did not expect the ending which is signs of a good writer.I would recommend reading the book.now that a movie was made from this story.Peter C
"The book started out REALLY slow, the author taking a while to explain the narrator's neuroses and past baggage, etc. My main issues with the book are the tone (very somber and depressing) and the ending. It's almost as if the author was given a certain number of pages and so had to wrap the book up without truly fleshing out its conclusion. Also, none of the characters were redeemable although Hawkins attempted to redeem the novel's narrator."
What a silly piece of melodrama. None of the characters have any depth or seem at all real. No self respecting actress would play any of the female role. And I strongly suspect this made for TV drama will come to the big screen.  Waste of time.
"While I am not a huge fan of fiction, this book, The Girl on the Train, was a superb character study encased within a murder mystery.  The author, Paula Hawkins, draws the reader into the story with paintbrush strokes into the work of the protagonist in all her misery and addiction. It got to a point where I couldn't put the book down because I had to know more and more about Rachel's universe, Megan's unbalanced mind and Anna's symbiotic personality.  Well done!!"
"Why would someone get involved in someone else's life that they don't know at all? The characters are all over the place and very static. All the characters have character flaws which makes them seem real but they are not likeable characters. Overall, a very well written book but at the end of the day a story that doesn't seem believable."
"Extremely complicated to follow the first 25% or more b/c of dates used, ""morning,"" ""evening,"" and characters' names as chapter headings.  Didn't care for the way it was written at all.  Almost stopped reading it at that point.Then about 60% of the way thru I finally got interested.  About 80% of the way thru I figured the whole thing out.  Some suspense, but nowhere near that of Gone Girl.  I understand the high ratings some people have given but I guess I have higher expectations."
I have to say I was a bit disappointed with this book. Not sure what all the excitement was about regarding this book. It was not a favorite. I found it had a predictable storyline (and ending). Not a fan of flashback or diary style of writing and that might be part of the problem I had with the book. It is written in the same style as Gillian Flynn (and I didn't like her books either). I have friends who loved this book and some that felt the same as I did. YMMV.
"Great page turner!  Always guessing :)  Creative way to tell such a thrilling story. Looking forward to seeing the movie when it comes out, though, I'm sure I'll be disappointed."
Enjoyed very much
"This book was a big disappointment to me.  I had trouble keeping track of which character was speaking.  The main plot seemed to tell about a girl who drank so much that she lost a bit more of herself with each day.  She may have witnessed a murder, and seemed compelled to solve it, which was futile because her memory was so impaired.  Sadly, I gave up after wading through about 60% of the book. (I know, the plot finally gets to the point, and I quit too soon!). Sorry to have wasted my time on this mess."
"As an avid reader, I had to delve in before the movie release. We all know it's hard to reproduce a great book, and I imagine the screenwriter's had a heck of a time with this one. It's quite hard to follow at first, but it does come together nicely if you can keep all the stories straight. It's a twisting, turning, unsuspected ride."
"A good read, but a bit confusing going back and forth among the characters. Read it at a busy time, so I would start and stop. Would have been a better if I had read the book without so many interruptions. Several of my friends have put it aside as they couldn't ""get into it"". Looking over the plot, I think it is a good story."
Not a happy go lucky king of book! A little far fetched but it is fiction! It reads pretty good and I read it quickly. It did keep my attention but I am not really into the gloom and doom stories! As far as the writing style..........I thought she did a good job with holding the reader's interest and making it just enough complicated to make you think about the characters and what will happen next. All in all.........not a bad book but not a great book either!!
"A brilliantly told story of love, betrayals, obsession. Rachel lost and lonely tries to surmount her deep depression after loosing her husband to another woman. She looses her grip on life becomes a drunk but believes firmly that Tom will come back to her. Against this repetitive background of ""self abuse"" a much darker story emerges slowly on a quiet out of the way residential street under the gaze of the continually passing trains..."
"I loved this book!  I loved how the characters were developed.  I loved how the story was told by each of the three women.  As I was reading the book, I kept thinking that I must be close to the end but then there was another twist that I had never considered.  After reading the book, I saw the movie and the book was much better than the movie."
I found the first chapter or so a bit confusing but I will be ruining it for others if I say why. But by the third entry ( not chapter) I was completely hooked and didn't put it down till I had finished it.
"I suppose it is a matter of comprehension, but I found the 1st person narration from the perspective of 3 different women hard to follow.  All certainly came together as the story unfolded.  Each chapter was named after the character relating the story, but date subheadings in the chapters were important to the story line.  However, the date subheadings were not included in the Contents section, so it required concentration (and rechecking) to track timelines.The story certainly holds your attention, but I could not identify with any of the principal characters.  Each of the three female characters were victims, but it was hard for me to characterize the ""flaws"" of Rachel and Anna as resulting from ""the abuse"" they suffered or whether they were due to their being ""weak"" people.  Maybe it doesn't matter, but I did not find the book to live up to its great reviews."
"I was late coming to this book and had heard so much about it!  Luckily, I had seen no spoilers.  I enjoyed the book as the writing is good.  I like the various perspectives of the characters involved.  I found I was invested in more of the characters than one, and I was always anxious to get to the next turning point.  I had theory after theory as I was reading and that's my reason for reading this type of book......to challenge myself as I am being entertained.  All in all a great read!"
"I enjoyed reading Gone Girl and this was recommended as a similar book that I would like. I did enjoy it, but it was a little slow going and slightly predictable. I prefer more plot twists and being surprised, and this book did not really surprise me. It also wrapped up a little too quickly and neatly, but I feel that way about a lot of books (such as Gone Girl and Luckiest Girl Alive). Would recommend to others for sure, but did not love it and would not re-read it again."
It has not been since I've read Gone Girl that a book captivated and sent my mind in so many directions. This is a brilliantly written whodunnit that will leave you convinced at different points that it is one particular character and you'll find yourself switching back and forth.The author did an amazing job with the character development and telling the story from the perspectives of the three main female characters. This book is a must read!
"This book was excellent from beginning to end! It was so difficult to put the book down, without wondering what would happen next. Every character in this book had their own secrets, which were revealed over time. Each character had strengths and weaknesses. The undertone of social behavior intertwined with alcoholism sent an important message to all. Great thriller!,"
If you like mystery it's great. It is wonderfully frustrating. As soon as you think you've figured it out something else happens and you actually have no idea how it will end. The movie was absolutely terrible so don't watch that! Just read the book^^
Haven't been this involved with the characters in a fiction novel in a long while...in fact I really don't read novels that much. Felt I could very much relate to Rachael. Author had a keen method of luring the reader in...almost too much for comfort.
"Very well written, I loved it!  Suspenseful! I love to predict how a book is going to end, but with this one, I couldn't until near the end, which makes it a very interesting read for me!!! I love novels set in England, where I have never been and I love drawing contrasts to the life in the USA! Anyway, a great read and can't wait for the movie!!!  Give me another great book like this! Kuddos to Paula Hawkins!!!"
I read it because the movie trailer looked great. I found parts of the plot very predictable and some words and phrases were terribly redundant. I read it in a day. I hope the movie is better.
"Interesting story. Structured a little like Gone Girl in that the story moves from the perspective of different characters in each chapter and they are in different times. It's a good idea to keep track of the dates. The characters are not particularly loveable - you want to tell the main character, Rachel, to stop being so stupid. Fairly easy to pick the villain once you get nearer the end."
"So obviously a product of writers' workshop thinking: Create an unusual situation and antagonistic characters, etc., etc. Boring. Don't know how it got to be a best seller."
Worst book ever. Every single page ... this Rachel character it was like reading the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over ...... and over again about how drunk she is and how drunk she wants to be how she can't remember anything . Just no! Save yourself the misery. Took me a month to finish because I was annoyed.
"What a nice little surprise this book was!  Downloaded it because it was on sale and the description sounded interesting, but wow!...  what a page-turner this turned out to be.  Read it in 2 days because I literally couldn't put it down. Intricate and suspenseful plotting along with great character development made this one of the best books I've read in ages. Won't give away any of the plot here but suffice it to say that if Hitchcock was still alive I think he would jump at the movie rights to this book."
"I really enjoyed this book - had a hard time putting it down.  I agree with other reviewers that ending was dissatisfying. I won't spoil anything (hate that about reviews) but will say that ending was just a little drawn out for my liking. I really hated the Anna character and could not fathom how any human could behave like she did at the end. However, the story really drew me in and the sad life of the main character was troubling but yet I'm sure there are people out there whose lives are very similar."
"I enjoyed this book for its genre! I didn't like all the filler in the middle, though. For example, the Scott and Rachel drama, the constant calls to Tom, the repeated relapses. I also found it particularly hard to like ANY of the six focused character. I DID like that they all had fatal flaws, etc. The ending was pretty damn well written. Kept me on the edge of my seat for the last fourty or so pages."
I was anxious to read the book as there was so much pre publication hype. I think overall it was just disappointing. I found the chapters jumping from woman to woman sometimes confusing. The story line had so many characters and really none embraced me. I am still trying to figure out the man on the train. Predictable characters....ending a bit far fetched....just disappointing!
"The book starts off slow but soon gets under your skin. I felt the true culprit was obvious a few chapters before the end but I still enjoyed the read. Her description of how the heroine feels as an alcoholic, her motivation to drink and her blackouts were insightful and gave me a deeper understanding of alcoholism."
"I enjoyed reading this book. It was different, kept me guessing and I was curious how it would end. Not sure what all the lower ratings are about, but maybe just not their cup of tea. There were a few ""oh, come on"" moments in it, but I still had to see what happened as a result. I did figure out the ending before I got to it (by picking up on a little clue from the author) but I still thought it was well written. I would try another from this author."
I loved this book! I couldn't put it down and read it in 4 hours. I know some have felt like none of the characters were sympathetic but I felt for Rachel and even Megan even Scott. Anna and Tom not so much. Very similar to Gone Girl but I liked this one better. The end was somewhat predictable 1/2 thru with a few unexpected twists.  I would recommend.
"The early reviews were right. Pick this thriller up and be prepared to plunge into its world of overlapping characters, well-placed red herrings and enough female angst to fill a shrink's office. Paula Hawkins' complex thriller is the book ""Gone Girl"" wanted to be but wasn't. (Sorry  ""Gone Girl"" fans.) Its heroine's alcohol addiction fuels her obsession with a house she passes daily on a train commute to London. Hawkins never quite lets us know if someone is heading for harm or salvation, and the imbalance is thrilling. Divided among three female characters, the chapters take the reader to the edge of one of two things - a purging reality or the embrace of unspeakable danger. Un-put-downable."
I doze into this book thinking it was a simple cliche mystery and knowing who did it with who and when and where but it completely kept changing its story and then I couldn't putting it down until I knew......
"I have heard the characters were all mental cases - yep to some degree they were.  A girl with a vivid imagination watched homes and the people who lived there from the train every day. Imagining their lives as stable, peaceful, loving, she couldn't have been further from the truth.  As an alcoholic, the girl became a different person when she drank too much, became involved in the lives of the people she watched from the train and almost lost her life because of that.  The surprise ending was handled very well by the author. I have a lot of responsibilities, so I am not one to read a book through at one sitting; therefore when I would have to take care of duties, my mind was constantly on the book, wondering, wondering - what next!  Good book and it would have been a real page turner if I had the ability to do that.  Really loved the way it was put together, with chapters on the main female characters. Really enlightened the understanding!"
"I did not put this book down until I read the last page.  Reading this book was trying to get out of a maze.  I would strongly encourage everyone to read this book before seeing the movie.  Knowing what the ""Girl on the Train"" is thinking is crucial to understand the movie.  My only disappointment I have is that this is the authors first book and I have to wait for the next one."
"The girl on the train is Rachel.  When the train stops at the signals, Rachel follows the movements of the couple who live at 11 Blenheim Road.  In her imagination they are Jess and Jason. In fact they are Scott and Megan.  A few doors down that road live Tom, Rachel's ex-husband, and his new wife, Anna. Rachel imagines a blissfully in love couple and is shocked when she sees another man in the back yard with Megan in an intimate embrace. Then there is the news that Megan is missing.  Rachel feels compels to assist the police.  And so the complex investigation begins.  However, underlying the whole story is Rachel's alcoholism and her propensity to invent things (tell lies).  The narration is shared between Rachel, Megan and Anna.  Rachel tries to fight her alcoholism and this has a poignant insight into the struggle of an addict to try to kick the habit – with always an excuse to procrastinate – “I'll start tomorrow”.  It always bothers me when the author chooses to tell the murder in the victim's voice.  The underlying theme of the book, one could say, is “truth or lies”."
"Rachel is “the girl on the train”.  She spends her days riding to and from London, usually well on her way to drunken oblivion, in an attempt to keep her roommate from realizing she’s been sacked from her job.  As she rides the train, sipping canned gin and tonics, she becomes obsessed with “Jess and Jason”, a couple whose house backs the tracks.  In her mind, she imagines the happy life they lead based on the glimpses she gets as the train trundles past.  At least until she sees Jess kissing another man on her deck.  When Jess goes missing the very next day, Rachel's reality begins to get significantly more complicated.Hawkins does a fantastic job of taking the facts and tearing them to shreds.  Just when you think you have it all figured out, you turn the page and poof, your theory implodes.  This is a page-turner that is packed with twists and turns you never see coming.  This is not a beach-read, however.  Make sure you have time to invest if you plan to see it through."
"It was hard to follow in the beginning-had to go back to previous chapters repeatedly to get the characters straight.  But once the characters have been established on this reader's mind, it was a page-turning novel with surprising twists!  I like how the author developed the plot and the built up the characters, which was superb!"
"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Some ladies I work with and I decided to start a book club and this was the first book we chose to start off with.  I am very satisfied with our choice.  The first twenty-something pages started off somewhat slow, but then it started picking up pace and I was hooked.  I started the book Friday night, went to sleep and finished it by Saturday evening.The story is told from 3 different character's perspectives--which made it even more intriguing.  Paula Hawkins did an exceptional job keeping the story interesting and once it peaks to climax, it's simply not possible to put the book down.  She did a great job choosing her adjectives as well--her descriptions of even the simplest items/places just sucked me in even more.  I would recommend this book and wouldn't even mind reading it again.  Great job Paula! :)"
"Reading a chapter or two each night was not enough.  I was too drawn in, too intrigued. So very well conceived, the story line takes a few interesting turns and it wasn't until near the end when I figured it out.  Then I had to keep going to find out why. In some ways I wish I hadn't as it reminded me all too well of my own broken marriage and the lies I was told -as the author wrote, ""even the ones that didn't matter.""  This story will continue to haunt me."
"I am happy that you asked for my opinion on this book. Honestly, I had a hard time finishing the novel. The main character, Rachel was so pathetic that I got tired of reading about her alcohol problem. I need a story that is uplifting. So the murder, the bad dynamics between Rachel and her ex husband's wife and the continuous drinking condition Rachel was described as having, I was really getting disturbed by the book. I managed to finish it only because the murderer wasn't revealed till the very end and I was curious about that detail."
"Entirely, self consciously ""twisty plot""-driven , with no psychological or relational reality. Several characters, but all with the same voice; no substantial differences among them except that their personal biographies are different. Message: women are weak and men are violent. The big triumphant ending (spoiler alert) is that women can be violent too. So yeah: ugh."
I enjoyed this book very much. The story has a slow buildup but the suspense was just enough to not be boring. Kept me guessing about what was going on. I also liked the story being told from the perspectives of the three main female characters. That gave the story a little more dimension. I'd recommend this one for a good weekend read.
"I never see a movie mage de from a book u til I read the book first.  This is an  amazing ""can't put it down"" book.  And it leaves me with no desire to see the movie.  I believe that as we read,  we form our own conceptual "" movie"" in our mind....therefore,  why spoil it?  Thanks. <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084>"
"Books are subjective so I'll simply say, it's just not my cup of tea. Hard for me to follow, mostly because it doesn't hold my interest. I bought it because of the high ratings even though it's not the genre of book I usually read. If this is the genre you read, do not pay attention to this review, I'd hate to keep you from what is probably a great book in it's genre."
"I've heard such good reviews about this book but it's torture to force myself to get through it just so I can say ""I've read this book"".  I want to like it but I'm feeling a bit ""meh"" about it.  Over and over again about the main character's drunken antics.  Please.... just get me to the end.  I'm hopeful I may someday finish it, but for now, this is my opinion.  And I'm pretty sure I know how it's going to end."
"It held my interest, though I disliked the main character because she blamed her drunkenness, loss of job, incessant lying, and openlyslovernly obsessions and whatever else was wrong with her on her inability to have a child and her emotionally abusive husband.  She was never in control of her life.  I will admit, Hawkins made the reader uncomfortable enough to want to pull her by the hair and say...get it together..NOW! Also, the ending was unrealistic...can't see how she could have escaped Thomas.  I guess I am uncomfortable with stories where the men are controlling and abusive and the women just sudsy victims or obsessed nutcases.  Also, that roommate put up with a LOT more than anyone I know would have. It was ok, but not as good as Big Little Lies.  The abused woman had a lot of class and held it together.  The ending of that book was amazing."
"This book was great! I will admit, it took some time to get into it. I encourage those starting this book to KEEP WITH IT! I finished the book on my kindle on a plane and immediately needed to chat with others about the ending. However, I was travelling alone and mostly everyone around me was sleeping. Looking forward to seeing the film adaptation!"
"Not the fault of the book, but I only read for 1/2 hour or so each night before going to sleep.  This book skipped around so much I was always unsure what part I was currently in??  If I was reading in larger blocks of time I may have been able to keep up with the pace better.  Not a book to help you sleep."
"I really wanted to love this book.  The premise was so intriguing....girl riding on the train inventing lives for the occupants of the houses she passes every day.  As the story unfolds about the girl on the trains past relationship with these houses I felt a little set up.  Some of the twists were true twists and the identity of the ""bad guy"" was initially surprising.  If this book had ended differently I would have had a better reading experience but it stepped into a very unbelievable set of behaviors that sapped the energy from the book.  The Girl on the Trains character was not as developed as it could have been.  I did enjoy the different voices the story was told from as we got to know more about the characters."
A real page turner from each of the principal player's points of view.  Loved it! Highly recommend it!
"I couldn't decide on a book for the beach, and finally chose this one. I was not disappointed! I love that the author has chosen to gradually intertwine the lives of the three women from whose perspective the story is told. The characters are flawed, yet relatable. Just when you think you know the direction in which she is sending the story, there's another twist. I was on the edge of my seat until I had finished the last page. Highly recommend this great read!"
"Although it took some time for me to get into this book, I can see why it is a best-seller.  I think I did not realize in the beginning that it was told by different characters and therefore I was a little out of sync for awhile.  But when I found my way, I really liked it.  It is not as good as ""Gone Girl"", but close.  I wanted so much for Rachel to get help with her drinking problem and wondered how much her roommate could put up with.  Seems like a lot.  So glad I read it."
"This was a good read.  It kept me interested all through it.  I do think it was a little contrived, but I guess a mystery novel is somewhat contrived.  I will say I knew what was going to happen when the book took a certain turn that I can't give away here, but I think many will agree with me.  I would recommend it as a good read if you just want to spend a day or 2 under house arrest (you don't want to go anywhere).  I believe it needs 3 and a half stars, but I don't know how to draw in half a star."
"This was a decent read... not my favorite. The story was interesting, and followed a similar plot/twist as Gone Girl, but not as good.If you're looking for a great read of this type, skip this one and go straight for Gone Girl!"
"The story was written in a unique way, from individual's voices over a period of time. Because of Ms. Hawkins particular style and perspective, it was a compelling way to weave the ""why"" and ""how"" of the plot together. I enjoyed the book even though it was quite dark and give Paula Hawkins high marks for creativity and suspense. I can see this as a movie but unsure whether I want to see it... very adult content and violent."
Not what I expected at all...big surprise for me at the end!
"I found the heroine, well she's not that,I should say the protagonist hard to love at first but the story drew you in and I was on edge waiting to see what she would do and what would happen next. So if you should be skeptical reading the first couple of chapters trust me you'll get drawn into this  ""nothing is really as it seems"" mystery story. I'm not going to drop any more ""spoilers"", I may have said too much already, but bottom line, I thought it was definitely worth the read."
"I found this book rather confusing to follow at first,  perhaps because of the way in which it is written.However, it certainly makes a fast moving ""thriller"" and I found the book hard to put down!Yes, I would recommend it, although I would describe it as a good read, but not necessarily a great read."
"I know this book has been on the ""hot"" list for a while now, and a lot of people love it.  Girl on the Train did not meet my expectations.  I pushed through to the end, long after I'd figured out ""who done it"" and despite the fact that all of the characters were so unlikeable and badly flawed that I didn't really care what happened to any of them.  I was hoping for a positive surprise somewhere, but didn't find it."
"Great suspense and fantastic descriptions make this a winner. A story of three women who are in an unlikely, tangled relationship with the men in their lives. Story is told predominately by Rachel, a young alcoholic divorcee who rides the train into London and back each day...for no other reason than to insinuate she has a job which in truth, she lost sometime ago. It is what she witnesses from the window of the train that makes this story so stunningly mysterious in a Hitchcock sort of way. As the plot unravels and the suspense increases, one cannot be sure just who is to blame for the murder of another of the women. It seems there are not enough motives but too many lies. In the end, the conclusion is a breath taking revelation into the mind of someone so deeply dark and disturbed, you wonder how two of the women survived at all."
"The beginning read was very slow, and I wasn't sure I was going to finish.  Since i spent $12 to read it, i suffered through until it started going good, which was about 1/2 way through.  It was a little confusing keeping the 3 ladies separate.  The end was phenomenal, not only because it was the end, but because i didn't see it coming."
"Excellent book, could not put it down! On the edge of your seat the entire time. Keeps you guessing, an excellent suspenseful journey through the blurred eyes of an alcoholic and the characters surrounding her in scandal. Intricately devised to change gears and take you back and forth in time to hone in on the BIG reveal. Can't wait for the movie!!!"
"I hated this book.  Could not wait to for it to end.  Why did I not  just toss it when I realized I did not like it?  Well that's just me, once I start something I have to finish it.  Anyhow, I just couldn't stand any of the characters.  Without a connection to anyone, it was worse than one of my boring college textbooks."
"It's a story about a troubled person who believes that she saw a murder happen while she was riding on a train; I read 3/4 of the book and stopped reading as I didn't enjoy trying to figure out what was happening.  In 40 years of reading, this is the only the 2nd book that I didn't finish.  However, I understand that they're making a movie about this book, so what do I know!?"
"I enjoyed ""The Girl on the Train"", the suspense kept you5going and interesting. To be honest, i didn't want the book to end. I was a little disappointed with myself not the book,  that I finished it in one (1) day.  Now, I'm waiting to see what day to go see the movie and can't wait for it to come out on DVD. THANKS FOR A GREAT BOOK,"
"A lot of people at school and others whom I work out with spoke highly of this this book. This was a nail-biter, edge-of-your-seat thriller that I couldn't put down! If you like suspense, this is the book for you! I absolutely love how the author goes from one person's point of view to the other because you get to feel what they're all feeling as you keep reading. This book was incredible and I'm so glad I read it! I hope Paula Hawkins puts out another book soon!"
"Fans of Gone Girl will undoubtedly be drawn to The Girl on the Train, and for good reason. Told from the perspective of three different narrators, this novel is a fast-paced, heart-pounding ride that you don't want to end. Do yourself a favor, don't try to figure it out and unravel the who, the whats, the whys, or the hows. Just let it unfold in front of you."
"This was an enjoyable book with plenty of twists and turns to keep me turning the pages. While there were parts of the book that were predictable, Hawkins does a nice job of keeping the reader guessing about the outcome. While at times I wanted to know more about certain characters in the book, they were developed well enough that i found myself connecting with them emotionally from start to finish. The story is told from the viewpoints of the three main female characters (Rachel, Megan and Anna), which adds to the mystery and emotion of the story. The pace of this book is enjoyable - while I was eager to get to the end of the story, at the same time, there were moments when taking a rest from the sadness that often defined Rachel's life became necessary for me emotionally. It was a good book, and a relatively quick read."
"I'm sure it was me, but I felt like the beginning dragged on and on. There was a lot of character development vs plot, and it started to loose my interest. The only reason I kept going was because I want to see the movie and compare. If it didn't get so much hype, I wouldn't have continued. The ending was super predictable."
"I found this book to be less than memorable. The narrator is drunk for a good deal of the book, making her neither reliable nor sympathetic. Add to those characteristics an ending that left me unable to suspend disbelief. In short, I was sorry I had bought this book, and even sorrier that I had spent the time it took to read it."
"A crash course in the life of the mentally unstable. Each character in this book has their own demons protected and solidified by lies.Hawkins did a great job keeping the reader involved through vivid imagery and different narrative voice.As a critique sometimes the characters blended together with each of their own problems and worries, but who know that may be the very style that Hawkins was going for to show how similar we all are."
"I was recommended this book by a friend, not the usual genre I read. I should have read it sooner. Amazing book, it will stick with me for some time."
Don't understand the popularity of this book -- I could not feel much sympathy for the main character as she became involved in the disappearance of a woman whose life she had fantasized about when seeing her from the train. The author did a great job relating the details of her journeys  - the train was a major character and more likable.... Kept reading to see how the mystery is solved but was disappointed overall - maybe it will make a good movie someday.
Although it did get a bit old try to remember through an alcoholics memory. I guessed the killer long before Rachel pieced it together. Her unraveling of the story was slow and tedious at times. I'm not quite sure I would compare this book with Gone Girl as that story blew me away with the shear attention to detail. But this story was griping in its own right. I do have to say that I hated Anna but found the ending very satisfying. It was a quick read and I would recommend it for what it is.
"Despicable characters who descend for endless boring 323 pages ever lower into banal destruction of self and others.  Incompetent writing that brings no value to readers who are faced with indistinguishable characters babbling the same incoherent nonsense.  The very most boring book I have read in at least 10 years.  Do not waste your money - or worse, your TIME - on this junk."
"I don't think I've ever been so tired of a character as I was of Rachel, the woman who rode trains.  Her emotions ran the gamut from A to B - exhaustion, confusion, weakness. (Make that A to C.)  By the middle of the book, I wished someone would shake her.  And they did, regularly.The writing wasn't bad, the plotting wasn't bad, but there were no characters I sympathized with.  By the end, I was ready for the whole cast to disappear.If you read this book, be ready for an unbelievable conclusion."
A thriller. Couldnt put it down. Great Character development with unexpected satisfying ending. Highly recommended.Women who are seeking their inner strenghth will appreciate the main character.
"This book kept me guessing.  It was definitely a page turner!  Just when I thought I had things figured out, and who did what, the author gave me a new surprise.  Thought the author had a keen imagination to write a story about someone who witnesses life vicariously from a train window.  The fact that the protagonist was an alcoholic was sad, but the author explained the reasoning behind it.  She left me with the hope that she would recover from her disease and lead a good life."
"Wow! I loved this book and to think that I almost didn't read it. For whatever reason, I had a hard time connecting with the book in the beginning, but kept at it at the insistence of so many friends. I am so glad I did. It was slow at the beginning, but it paid off in the end. The book is told from the point of view of three different women. The unreliable narrator tactic worked well with the way the author told the story from different dates. If you liked Gone Girl you will like this book. I don't see how my review is even necessary or helpful considering how many reviews this amazing book and author already have, but I wanted to share anyway. Once I got into the book, I could not put it down and had to know what would happen next. I guessed who the killer was, but I don't think that means anything. The book is a psychological thriller not a mystery so the suspense comes from wondering if our MC will escape the dangers posed by the villain and not from solving the mystery of who dun it. It was a nail biting experience at the end as I worried for two of the main characters and wondered what would happen. I can't say more without giving it away.If you are one of the few who has not read this book, you simply must read it. Please don't let the slow start put you off. You will see, soon enough that it was worth the wait. This novel is unique and not like any other book out there. It shares many of the same plot techniques and narrative as Gone Girl, but the story is completely different from Gone Girl and from any other book. That's what makes the book such a hit.If you have read this book and loved it like I did, I highly recommend that you read, Peter Swanson's The Kind Worth Killing. It hooks you much quicker and it is every bit as good as The Girl on the Train. Both are at the top of my all time favorite books. You can read my in depth review of The Kind worth Killinghttp://www.melissasugarwrites.com/2015/05/the-kind-worth-killing-review-with.html"
"I got this book to satisfy my need for another Gone Girl –type of thriller to read with my mother this summer. This fit the bill.  I’m usually the type of person who can’t predict an ending in a mystery and I’m almost always surprised with where it goes. Not so with this book. The plot is not too complicated, so it’s perfect for laid-back summer brain where you might not be completely engaged every time you pick up the book. Prepare yourself for a main character that you will not like. This makes the story itself shine more than the main character, which is a very interesting. Also, the main idea of the story – witnessing something on a train and then inserting oneself into the drama is a great premise. Overall, a good book and a great summer read."
"I started this book several times.  Finally, I committed to reading it!  I had to take notes on characters and what was happening during their timeline.  This helped me follow the story better.  All the characters are flawed.  So, it is a bit like Gone Girl.  But, I did enjoy trying to figure out who committed the crime.  I was surprised at the ending.  So, hang in there and discover for yourself whether you like this book.  Could it be a good movie?  Hmmmmm,  maybe."
"I loved this book from start to finish.  And I also loved how it was written - in the ""First Person"", but by three different people, but also each narrator follows a slightly different timeline.  The main narrator is Rachel with Megan also narrating a good part of the book and finally Anna who plays just a minor role in the narration.  Megan's story is a few weeks behind Rachel's.The story is excellent with a great twist at the end.  It is very well written and the characters, who you get to know in a very gradual way, are very believable.  The story, and writing style, gripped me from the very beginning and kept my interest right up to the end.If this is Paula Hawkins' first book then I cannot wait for her second one."
"Like Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train is probably a good movie, worth about 90 minutes of attention.  The book is tedious, repetitious and superficial like a soap opera - not worth the time it takes to read it.  Both books are good for the plane or the beach if the reader is not looking for depth or literary accomplishment from the writer."
"This was highly touted and I did like it, listening to the Audible version on my morning walks. It was well narrated. At first it was hard to care about this young woman who had totally lost her sense of self respect and was basically a desperate drunk. But as the story unfolded and she observes a couple in the house down the street from where she used to live, she fantasizes about their life as she fakes going to work on the train to the city. She is living with a friend since her husband left her but doesn't want her to know she has lost her job.I was involved in the characters and felt sorry for this pathetic woman who can't seem to face reality and get her life together. I would recommend book. It does twist toward the end."
"No wonder it's one of the fastest-selling novels of all time! This thriller is completely engrossing, and the three women from whose perspective the story is told are well fleshed-out characters, although Rachel is clearly the standout. I did guess the ending about a quarter of the way through the book, but it had me in doubt about my guess several times and had plenty of other shocking and absorbing moments. I read it in 2 sittings. :) More Paula Hawkins, please!"
"I REALLY enjoyed this book and suspenseful story line.  Definitely read this book before seeing the movie, it's worth it! The story line is well developed with complex characters.  I also really enjoyed the multiple story lines and how you could see each story coming together, it added to the suspense!"
"At first I wasn't sure I'd like the book, as it started quite slowly and almost burdensome at times. But I stuck with it, and I'm glad I did! As the author gave us more details about each character, she started weaving the web that eventually trapped me and I was hopelessly and deliciously entangled. As she fed more and more details, the story took many right and left turns, and each time I thought I'd solved the mystery another detail was leaked and I found I was completely wrong. I could not help but finish the shocking climax in one sitting, each event unfolding at just the right place, finishing with the most unlikely heroine saving the day. Get and read this book - and be prepared for good ride. All aboard!"
"I like a good read with lots of and turns ... a great book with interesting characters and I was gripped by the storyline in the first chapter . A voyeuristic peek into suburban life , proving things are never as they seem and we don't know what happens behind closed doors. Very real... it happens .Loved it!"
"A great and easy read to get wrapped into.If you have a blizzard taking over your Saturday and the only thing on TV is apocalyptic new reports then I highly suggest downloading this book and jumping in. It was fun from start to finish. My only reason for not ratting this book higher was that it really begins to slow down in the final 100 pages. I was starting to get anxious that the book would end before the plot wrapped up. Finally in about the last 50 pages it all comes at you so fast that you're left thinking, "" what! that's all!!?"""
"I enjoyed the intrigue of looking into the lives of the couples from the girl on the train as at first she seemed just an objective observer going to and from work while riding the train as any commuter does on a daily basis. Then the intrigue grows into great suspense as the girl on the train not only is revealed as a former family member of one of those couples, but the reader becomes the sleuth trying to solve the mystery. I had to force myself to turn the light off, stop reading, and go to bed."
"Apart from the baby, or it's hard to find a sympathetic or interesting character.  Even the setting is gritty and depressing. Finally, there is a resolution of sorts, and the plot is over. There is no real satisfaction at the outcome, no explanation of behaviours, and no desire to meet the characters nor setting in a sequel."
"Not the fault of the book, but I only read for 1/2 hour or so each night before going to sleep.  This book skipped around so much I was always unsure what part I was currently in??  If I was reading in larger blocks of time I may have been able to keep up with the pace better.  Not a book to help you sleep."
A thriller which has the potential to keep you on your seat-edge but fails due to the complexity introduced by having first person narration switching between a no. of different persons involved in the story while at the same time switching the time frame of the narration. Result was continuous minor frustration particularly when returning to story after a break in regaining the story threads.
My friends raved about this book and I couldn't wait to read it. I think their accolades were overly enthusiastic. The three main characters were so whiney. Each one wallowed in self-pity. I enjoy reading mysteries and I like authors who can build the suspense until the last few days. This book held no surprises and I was able to figure out the villain before the book was half over.  Most readers will not agree with my assessment of Hawkins book but I doubt I will read another of her novels.
"I found this to be a quick read. Entertaining to say the least. Although I figured it out halfway through, that didn't stop me from enjoying the writing style and how it was going to get to where it was. And of course, I didn't know everything so the little twist here and there were a nice surprise. Great characters that were never dull, and a plot line that moved along and didn't linger on any one moment longer than it needed to. I would recommend this book for sure."
"One of the weirdest mysteries I have ever read, and one of the best. Told from the perspectives of 3 women, this story weaves and warps as it goes along with a surprise around the turn and then another surprise. Very visual. And sometimes you may think you are losing your mind. I think the author intends these thoughts on the part of the reader. Shape shifting, ""now wait a minute"" moments, ''did I miss something?"" thoughts and then it comes together into an amazing whole. I loved it!"
I thought the female characters were fascinating and the male characters were simple plot vehicles just like so many female characters are in books written by men.  I found that refreshingly unusual!  Spurred an interesting discussion in our book club about how women relate to other women and how men fit into that whole dynamic.
I found this disappointing.  I was drawn in by the synopsis and had high expectations but found the book to be pretty boring and not at all gripping.  Just dragged on and on.  Would not recommend.
"I have read reviews comparing this story to Gone Girl, but I don't agree with that perspective.  It's an interesting read, but I found my prediction of ""who-dunnit"" to be correct, and that was just around the middle of the book.  The characters were difficult to like...which I suppose could be the comparison to Gone Girl.I enjoyed the book enough to finish it quickly, as it is a page turner.  I gave it 4 stars simply for that reason.  It moves pretty quickly."
A slap to Hitchcock's face.
"This book is completely captivating.  Once you start reading, clear your schedule because you're not going to do anything else until you finish.  Movie is also great."
"I was excited to read a book compared to Gone Girl, but this novel drove me crazy with all the POV changes and going back and forth in time. I forced myself to finish it. None of the characters were appealing. I didn't like anybody and didn't care what happened to them. I'm glad it's over. The whole comparison to Gone Girl I suspect was a marketing ploy to get people to buy the book, and it worked because I did buy it, but I learned my lesson never to do that again. Fool me once..."
"Terrific thriller! The story is told from three different points of view, but it is never confusing.  If you want a tale of love, betrayal, murder and regret  with constantly building suspense, this is it.  This book about the intertwined lives of suburban Londoners is not predictable, though it keeps you trying to guess at lots of aspects .The primary narrator is an alcoholic, so you are always on uncertain  ground with her  memories. Near the end, I could not put  the book down!"
"This book really needed a strong-willed editor . It  takes us through endless instances of the same  kind of dysfunctional behavior of the alcoholic principal character, till it became excruciatingly boring to keep reading.  Especially since, by the time you're about two thirds through the book, you have a pretty good idea of who the villain is."
"The idea of a woman observing life from a train window is an interesting concept. When the story is being told from this vantage point, it remains  riveting. However, when the main character is off the train...whether in town or in her apartment... she emerges as unlikeable and foolish and in need of an intervention.  The other voices in alternating chapters add to understanding the whole story. All in all, it was a good book and the author kept me guessing until the end."
"I read the description and couldn't wait to start reading, unfortunately I was disappointed. All of the characters are hard to like and the whole time I was waiting for something to happen. There isn't some crazy twist that you can't see coming and most of the excitement is the very last chapter of the book.Honestly, it was just kind of ok."
"I really enjoyed this book. It was engaging from the beginning , weaving the characters and their stories together. I feel that the pace picked up towards the  middle of the book, and it was very difficult for me to put down. I liked the suspense, the ending wasn't predictable to me, and I really appreciated to fact that it had a definite ending, rather than leaving the reader hanging.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes a good, sometimes twisted story line."
"Just finished this fascinating and terrific book. All told in the first person(s), Author Hawkins pretty much covers it all; psychological, emotional, and sexual, with an interwoven narrative of truths,half truths,and lies depending on who's talking. A little confusing at times but compelling none the less. Since on of the characters is usually well lubricated with alcohol, a nice glass of cabernet makes a comfortable reading companion for this twisty yarn. Definitely worth the read.."
"I found myself reaching for my kindle every time I had a few minutes to kill, reading this book whenever I had a chance. I couldn't help but like the main character, Rachel, who was always full of good intention, and meant to do the right thing. However, at the same time, she's someone that I would avoid in real life, since she was clearly one ""messed up"" individual. The story was well written, giving the 3 female characters' perspective throughout the plot's twists and turns. Very enjoyable!"
great book
"Although the story was good, the writing was too wordy. Could have been just as interesting had she stopped going over the same thing all the time."
Very boring
"I was really looking forward to reading this book since it had gotten so many high ratings. I'm sad to say I was somewhat disappointed. Without giving away to much of the story, I will just say be prepared to read the first half without much happening. It does become suspenseful the last quarter but for me that was too long . comparing it to Gone Girl or Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, both given four and a half or five stars, this does not measure up ."
I hated all the characters.
This novel follows an alcoholic woman struggling with her broken life that is the result of her drinking. I found the vivid and real portrayal of feelings and situations an alcoholic many times finds themselves in the best feature in the writing. There is a little suspense following a character's murder and a who done it story line. I gave this novel 3 stars because it entertained me however did not captivate me.
I tried to love this book. I wanted to. The Characters were unlikeable and messy and frankly halfway through the book I stopped reading for months. The ending picked up and there were some definite turns and twists but I can easily say there are better choices for this type of Hitchcock wanna be read.
"This book was so suspenseful, I couldn't help but  finish it in a few days. Slightly disturbing at times, but truly was very well written. I tend to lose  interest when authors include incredibly long, detailed descriptions of scenes, so I was grateful that this author doesn't do that. Worth the read."
Was hard to know which of three characters were telling their part of the story at first.  I had to keep looking back to the beginning of the chapter to see who it was.
"Wow-has been many years but this is a book I couldn't put down.  I also freelance right, but am not an expert.  I have to be at work at 5:00 a.m. in the morning and my husband will attest that I stayed up ""way"" later so I could read the book.  Unfortunately could relate to major character,so perhaps that made it much for relevant.  Are they going to make it into a movie?  I'm sure would be difficult but not impossible.Debby Hamilton"
"A sad joke concerning those who are substance abusers asks ""How can you tell an addict is lying?"" Answer: ""His/her lips are moving."" Really not funny, but it supports a basic tenet of this book: every character is a liar. Most of the story is told from the point of view of a severe alcoholic, who looks into the homes of people whose houses are near the railroad tracks of the train she is on. She invents stories about their lives in between her drunken stupors. One day a murder occurs involving one of the people she watches; she decides to try to solve the murder on her own after lying to the police, making up her own story of what she believes happens. No spoiler alert here about what happens and who's involved. Suffice to say, the title of the book is a bit misleading: when I saw ""girl"", I thought the book would feature a young girl and her adventures on a train as it crosses the English countryside. Reading about a whino whose husband dumped her is not my cup of tea."
"I found the popularity of this book a bit puzzling, but it seems to belong to the current trend in ""dark'' fiction. Credit must be given to the clever weaving of plot and only a handful of characters around the setting of a commuter train, and it keeps the attention by shifting back and forth among them; but the consistently morbid tone of the piece was simply not to my taste. I came away from reading it feeling I'd gained nothing from reading it other than its creative plot construction. I felt no affinity for the characters as worthwhile knowing and was ready to move on to something more inspiring, or -- at the very least -- informative."
"A real page turner.  Complicated main character fueled by alcohol makes sometimes good and sometimes totally erroneous conclusions.  What is real and what is her drunken imagination?  Loved it.  Full of surprises, danger, suspicion, stalking, and I just couldn't put it down!  Highly recommended for those who can spend a few hours reading it quickly!"
"My lack lustre review may stem from my gender bias that I wanted stronger coping skills from the heroines far earlier. Too much contrivance and too many weak characters for me,  but it may have more resonance with the female millennial set.  I think I will like the movie better, because the viewing public will want a stronger, less drunk Rachel."
"This story will shake you to your core. I absolutely couldn't put this down. Whatever you think you know, or remember will only seem like a dream when you come to the last page of this thrilling, nightmarish story. You won't look at people or their lives the same way ever again. If you're looking for some thing to get lost and carried away in, look no further. Anna will tell you what happened that day on the train."
I could not put this book down once I started reading it.  It was enthralling and masterfully planned.  The way it was formatted as individual perspectives from each character as the story unfolded can only be described as genius.  I am certainly looking forward to the next book from this author.
Excellent book. It took a little while for the story to pull me in but eventually it did. When it did it was hard to put it down. I look forward to comparing the book with the movie. Maybe this time the movie will measure up somewhere close to the book. It hasn't happened yet but I can still hope.
"This was very well written. I love mysteries that go back and forth like this. You hear about something, a detail that seems important; then, later, you understand how it came to be. I highly recommend this for the mystery/thriller lover."
"I liked the idea of the book but not the complete execution.  It's difficult for the reader to really like or relate to any of the characters.  Although I did feel like the descriptions of Rachel's battle with alcohol to be sometimes somewhat compelling.  I really did feel her want/need for a drink.The reader is trying to figure out 'who done it?' BUT the author did not really give us enough clues for us to have any idea what she had in mind. I partially understand that is because we are supposed to be seeing through the eyes of the various characters but I felt as if I wanted a little more depth and nuance that would clue us in (ever so slightly) as to what the endgame would be.  When things become apparent, I was surprised but didn't feel enough excitement for the 'AH-HA' moment.  I felt like I was kind of cheated by being completely blinded from all of what was really going on."
"Yet another version of an inexplicably popular genre: poorly written books about awful people who do awful things to each other because they're too shallow and too bored to think of anything better to do with their time. Girl on the Train, Gold Finch, Gone Girl, Go Set a Watchman. Why do all these train wrecks start with the letter G? Not because they're good or worth your time to read. Why these books are sometimes grouped with Anthony Doerr's All the Light We Cannot See is beyond me, since Doerr always writes beautifully about worthwhile people and subjects. Kindle keeps recommending books like this for me, I guess because I keep reading them. Addicting, like the booze their protagonists often over consume. No worries, though. Tomorrow I'm going to quit."
"Well written tragic thriller about how people delude themselves about the causes of the sadness and loneliness in their lives. Rachel, the main character, drinks a lot to combat her depression and isolation. Unemployed, she rides the trains, observing the activities of her ex-husband and the neighbors. What starts as curiosity mixed with drunken fantasy evolves into an investigation that eventually gets her back on the road to peace, health and sanity."
I have missed to reading a book that was so intriguing that forced to keep reading. Very well written and incredibly thrilling. I was at the edge of my seat the entire time. Great thriller book!
"""Melancholy"" is the adjective that comes to mind in this slow moving thriller. I was amazed to find a second analytical book was written to explain the plot. Our protagonist is just not that complicated and she also suffers from learned helplessness, an undesirable trait in any heroine. However, she does have compassion even if it's clumsily presented. Truly the only touching connection is that which was forged between our heroine and the woman who took her place."
"Another contemporary feminist fiction novel full of unsympathetic characters careening through the plot.  Unless that is what you want to read, avoid this book."
"This novel was slow-going at first. The characters were all flawed. However, the story soon turned into a ""page turner"" and I was determined to reach the end as soon as possible. Who hasn't peered into the windows of strangers and imagined what their lives might be like? I enjoyed the book very much. I did not give it 5 stars because of the ""slow"" start and the fact that there really weren't any heroes/heroines in this tale."
"In my opinion it has a slow beginning. It consists of three main characters, but it goes back and forth in time which is hard to keep up when you don't have time to read the book in one sitting. Somehow you kind of know who the killer is, but you want to read the entire book. Interesting. First time reading Paula Hawkins."
"I do not normally like books with multipile narrators but Paula Hawkins pulls it off. The characters are well drawn, especially the principal narrator, the boozy but well meaning Rachel with a romantic view of other people's lives. The more I got into this book, the better I liked it. Ultimately I found it gripping. It has been compared to ""Gone Girl,"" but I think this is much better. I found it very satisfying  and was sorry to finish it.Llewellyn King"
"I couldn't put the book down. Every time I had to stop reading it (to go to sleep, work, etc.) I couldn't wait to pick it up again. It's literally all I could think about."
"It was very difficult to sort out the characters,  plus Rachel's alcoholism made her a very unsympathetic prerson. Once I got past this, I found the book fascinating."
Better than the movie
"This book was hard to put down. I highly enjoyed it. Especially since I heard the reviews of the movie were quite poor, I decided to dig into the book instead."
"I never see a movie mage de from a book u til I read the book first.  This is an  amazing ""can't put it down"" book.  And it leaves me with no desire to see the movie.  I believe that as we read,  we form our own conceptual "" movie"" in our mind....therefore,  why spoil it?  Thanks. <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084>"
"Good read.  Book had some unusual twists.  The book is written from the perspective of the three main female characters -- they all see fundamentally the same situations but from their unique perspective.  Also had a time line as the book shifted from woman to woman....eventually I just ignored the time line and focused on the story from each woman.  The ending was somewhat predictable but still had a few twists which made me say ""Didn't see that coming."""
I read this book because it referred to me by someone who loved it. However I was so bored pretty much during the whole thing. I feel like it dragged on and on in the same position for the 1st part of the book. The end was the most exciting part and with that wasn't that great. But it is just my opinion. I would not recommend it.
"I really wanted to like this book. Its written in the first person for all the major characters so you have to keep track of which person is ""speaking"" at any point in time. Thats really not my preferred style of novel. There isnt much to the story so it progresses slowly and is repetitive. Its an ok read but nothing special"
"I loved this book. It was a page turner, and even though I figured out the killer somewhat early, it was exciting and interesting to read all the way through. I read reviews from people who didn't like it because they found the characters so distasteful. I certainly wouldn't surround myself with these people, but I had no problem reading about them. I thought they were realistic and well fleshed out (although most of them were seriously damaged people). Would love to read more by this author."
"It's been a long gone time since I read an actual paperback and wow this storyline is a page turner.  I read half the book the first night!  I've lived paralleled similarities to Rachel and can't wait to see the movie too.  Keep up the great writing Mrs Hawkins, I'll be keeping an eye out  for your next masterpiece!"
So disappointed in this one.  The back and forth chapters would have been a great idea if the writer had been able to distinguish the characters with more depth. Both the main female and male characters were so similar that it was hard telling them apart. The writing was only mediocre.  Also saw the reveal way before the end. Plus the backstory for one of the characters was just silly.  It was very popular.....a lot if people loved it. Not me.
"I really enjoyed this book.  The suspense kept me reading and on a long car ride, I couldn't put it down.  I kept trying to figure out the mystery, but didn't guess the ending. I have heard the movie portays the story well also so I am looking forward to watching it as well. It's in a similar vein to ""Gone Girl."""
"I really enjoyed this book.  The characters evolved throughout the story. I found myself despising Rachel, then feeling sorry for her and finally admiring and cheering for her.  The mystery unfolds slowly and kept me guessing until end.  A very good read"
I couldn't get enough of this book and wanted to keep reading to until the end.  3 different women narrate this story and it's a great way to see all of their opinions and well as how they come to find out the twist in the story.  O look forward to reading more from this author.  A must read before seeing the movie.
"From all the views in this tangled web, honesty, from all all the characters,  Dark as their thoughts may have been.  A  great read from start to finish. It's been a long time since I have read a book this quickly. Eat read sleep. Repeat then done. I am sure the movie will not hold a candle to this book but of course I'll see"
LOVED THIS BOOK.  I read it in record time.  I must admit that the end result crossed my mind and was happy to see that I was right.  Great book
"I had a hard time getting through the first few chapters because the main character was just kind of pathetic at that point. But after that the book takes off once it gets to the mystery part of the story and I enjoyed it. Lots of twists and turns as the story progresses so I was not able to guess ""who done it"" until very near the end. Our book club read this and liked it overall, so I would recommend it if you can push through the beginning of the book."
"It was good, but the number of characters became a little confusing, since the majority of the book is written in first person, and it will jump from one female character to another female.  You need to get the main characters in your mind first, and then you can get the story line.  It will be as good movie, since it does have a little ""mystic"" feel in the story, and you are not sure who did  the crime and why.."
"I thought this book would be great based on the reviews but I found the main character very unrelatable and as the author continually changes the perspective and dates, the flow of the story becomes choppy. I only give it 3 stars because of the twist in the very end, the rest of the story leading up to that point gets 2 starts."
"How boring and cliche. These days, the hand that rocks the publishing cradle is the extra money in the bank just about anyone who is on the bestseller list has to drink coffee at bourgeois cafes whilst waiting for heir manuscript to be picked up and published. Barf."
"It was a good read, however I certainly wouldn't rate it among the best.; I'm somewhat surprised it hit the best seller list.  The characters struggle with emotional challenges complicated by alcohol and stress with the backdrop of a sudden murder.  As the title suggests, much of the action and assumptions are made from the main character perspective (what she thinks, fantasizes and witnesses from the train window). From my perspective the ending was very predictable."
"Captivating ""who-done-it"" murder mystery.  Unusually presentation.  Written in 1st person.  Paints in-depth profiles of key characters and what they are thinking.  Keeps you guessing whether primary character (Rachael) has murdered someone, was imagining everything she saw, or was just plain crazy.  Suspense throughout,.....right to end.  Good read, but you will need to follow sequence of events carefully.  Chapters flip back and forth in time."
Writing style was fine but it seemed to take a very long time to explain a small plot.  Could not warm up to the girl on the train due to her alcoholic addiction but maybe that is real life. She was a mess.
"After all the advertising and buzz re: the book and movie, I found the plot to be slightly predictable. I won't say more so I don't inadvertently make a statement that becomes a spoiler. Ok read, but not as good a I thought it would be."
"I downloaded this book to read based on reading the short Amazon plot summary above.  I didn't know anything else about the plot and, had I known a bit more, I probably would have chosen a different book to read while on maternity leave.  That said, the storyline of the book is engrossing (if depressing) and pulls you in, but I was not blown away by the writing.  It's a good option if you are looking for a quick read... Just not while on maternity leave."
"Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning and night! Every day she rattles down the track.  She watches the cozy homes and sees the same couple daily and has even started to feel like she knows them.  Their life-as she sees it is perfect, not unlike the life she recently lost. And then she sees something shocking and becomes entangled in the investigation and the lives of everyone involved.When I first began to read Girl on a Train, I found it dark and depressing.  I put it down several times as I could not become interested in the daily train rides and I found myself asking, ""Is this all there is?"" As I read through the first chapters, however, I became spellbound and couldn't wait to read on.  The story keeps you on the edge with riveting tales of intimacy and betrayal.  The characters are well-developed.  One feels a combination of emotions for Rachel including pity, empathy, disgust, and admiration.  I didn't want the book to end!"
"As an avid reader, I had to delve in before the movie release. We all know it's hard to reproduce a great book, and I imagine the screenwriter's had a heck of a time with this one. It's quite hard to follow at first, but it does come together nicely if you can keep all the stories straight. It's a twisting, turning, unsuspected ride."
"The book was GREAT! I highly recommend it. I started it on my Kindle but ended up getting it on paper back instead so it would be easier to flip back to prior chapters to check the dates/names since the book alternates a bit. HIGHLY recommend reading it. I was sad when it was over, and that doesn't happen to me very often!"
"I don't normally read this type of book, but decided to give it a try after my sister loved the movie. I like to read a book before I see the movie so I know what is missing in the movie. This book was hard to put down, I read it until my eyes couldn't focus any more, then started again the next morning."
"I enjoyed reading this book but when it ended, I did realize that there were several flaws in the character development and I felt somewhat tricked. The author developed several of the characters nicely but then intentionally left out details about some others that made the ending feel like a cheat. The premise was interesting: the narrator seeing a house everyday on her train ride into the city and making up lives for the occupants...eventually she discovers much about their true lives and how it differs from what she had invented and how it also relates to her own past history. I would recommend it but you might not be thrilled by the end."
"A good read, but a bit confusing going back and forth among the characters. Read it at a busy time, so I would start and stop. Would have been a better if I had read the book without so many interruptions. Several of my friends have put it aside as they couldn't ""get into it"". Looking over the plot, I think it is a good story."
"Much hype about this book.  The interaction of all the characters was improbable. While it is fiction and a snapshot of a time in space, none of the characters were particularly likable or realistic.  Hard to find much empathy for or identification with any of them. I know alcoholics with some of the devastating results experienced by Rachel.  Not sure people ""recover"" their memory or black-outs as quickly and clearly as Rachel.  But it would be a very long book if in the real world. The two babies in the book, one living, one deceased, were the ones for whom I felt anything except vague annoyance.  Imagine attempting to navigate such a self-absorbed adult world.  While the book moved quickly, ultimately I was disappointed."
"Rachel is THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN, a pathetic, sloppy drunk who watches houses from a window train, envying the lives she imagines the people have, including jet ex-husband and his new wife Anna and their baby. Rachel, lie has blackouts, stalks her ex, and insinuates herself into a police investigation involving the presumed murder of the third unreliable female narrator, Megan.THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN lacked the pacing of a good mystery/thriller. I couldn't empathize with or even relate to any of the narrators, in fact, I found Rachel so loathsome I just didn't care about the plot. I suppose if I didn't need a character to care about or root for, I might have been more interested, but I found myself hoping Rachel was the perp so she could get the death penalty, even though I'm anti DP and the UK doesn't have the DP.THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is a better book than my enjoyment reading it suggests. Paula Hawkins has crafted an intricate, mind-bending plot and while her writing didn't interested me, I recognize that Hawkins writes quality sentences and paragraphs. This book just wasn't for me, but a lot of people loved the book and mystery, so don't let my review dissuade you if this seems like your kind of book. I think my genre tastes are changing. I'm sure if I picked up GONE GIRL for the first time I'd like that either, though I did a few years ago when it first came out."
"It was a great story. I can't believe I finished it. I want more. I'm still in shock at the twist in the end. I don't like disturbing story lines with lots of blood or heart wrenching topics. It's a smooth read with a great story line. Not too disturbing, not too much blood or sex. You'll only stay up at night from being unable to put the book down, not from nightmares. I just loved it. I can't wait for the movie to come out."
I really enjoyed this book. Usually I can figure out the killer but this time I was blind sighted. The author really keeps you guessing. She makes you feel a real empathy for the female characters. A good read!! Gwynne Gall
"I was somewhat disappointed. Expected it to be like Gone Girl which I enjoyed immensely. The Girl on the Train was exciting up to a certain point. The technique of using three different voices wasn't very skillfully applied.  They all sounded the same. Same language, same way of thinking, which made the book a bit tedious. Good plot line though, although a bit contrived. A good easy read that doesn't stay long in memory."
"All of us have been ""watchers"" at one time or another.  And maybe even ""watched.""  To take the story beyond that behavior is a unique perspective. Very often we build scenarios for people we see whom we do not know or are ever likely to encounter.  This story takes that to the extreme.  Written from two female voices the reader is party to the many ways a situation can be viewed or described.  Just enough twists to keep you engaged."
"I loved the story. It kept me intrigued the entire time. At first it was a bit difficult going from each women's point of view, but once I got familiar with their story, it was easy. I also found just a few spelling/grammatical errors, which is something that just bothers me a little. I am really looking forward to watching the movie after reading the book!"
"It took me a while to get to this book. I was unaccountably put off by all the hype. But once the movie was released, I thought I should read it before seeing the film. I still haven't seen the movie, but this book is fantastic! I was completely engrossed from the first page to the last. Thank you, Paula Hawkins!"
"Great book, always kept you into it and wanting to read more.  Many twists, once you thought you knew what was going on they threw in another twist"
"I'm an avid reader, but rarely read fiction. I recently joined a book club and this was the first month's book. I have to admit when I first started reading I thought, ""This is written like a diary? This is going to be a very long 300+ pages..."" I couldn't have been more wrong. I read this book in a day. I just couldn't put it down. It drew me in and I just needed to know what had happened and what was going to happen next. Anyone who likes a mystery/thriller should enjoy this book!"
Reading this book was like getting a gift that you were not expecting.  I read the summary and was hooked.  I found myself unable to stop thinking of the next opportunity I would have to read!!  I don't like to summarize the story or provide spoilers in my reviews.  If you love a well written mystery with fully developed characters and twists and turns you can't predict (and I consider myself very good at predicting plot twists) THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU!  Just make sure to clear your schedule!
"This novel has three narrators each of whom is unreliable in her own way. The intensity, and the mystery, builds slowly until you just can't stop reading in order to find out who did what."
"A real ""who done it"" story. The author draws you into each of the woman's lives then twist and turns them around. Not sure who is responsible for the outcome of the story, all lives interact with one another. Because this happened then this happens but wait.... Because what was witnessed while on the train rolling past..... All intertwined. This is a very good murder mystery book.I probably should give this a five star but I hated the gruesome ending. It was the right ending....I just don't like violence.  I usually stay away from murder mysteries but it was our book club pick for the month. I am glad we picked it.I don't think I will ever get drunk ( not that I ever have but I will never contemplate it now) after reading this one!"
"This book has received great reviews but I have to say ""I"" am not a fan.  I didn't care for it from the beginning but kept reading.  It picked up about half way through.  It took half the book to set the stage - too long for me.  I continued reading and finally, painfully finished it.  There are twists and turns.  The ending was a surprise.  BUT, I found the characters psychotic (they were) and unrealistic.  I would not recommend this book.  Too many good ones to pick from."
"If you're looking for an easy, enjoyable read without too much depth, this book is for you.A decent novel by anyone's standards. Well written with the right amount of humor and wit. (British humor and language is always something I enjoy -- a break from the norm.)However, I don't see what all the rave is about. It's another Gone Girl in style and plot. Don't get me wrong, it was definitely a page turner and I often found myself wanting to get back to reading as soon as possible. But, in the end, I just did not love this book.I guess with all the hype about how great of a novel this was, I got my hopes up. High expectations and average quality make for a semi-letdown reader."
"Apart from the baby, or it's hard to find a sympathetic or interesting character.  Even the setting is gritty and depressing. Finally, there is a resolution of sorts, and the plot is over. There is no real satisfaction at the outcome, no explanation of behaviours, and no desire to meet the characters nor setting in a sequel."
"It took me a while to get to this book. I was unaccountably put off by all the hype. But once the movie was released, I thought I should read it before seeing the film. I still haven't seen the movie, but this book is fantastic! I was completely engrossed from the first page to the last. Thank you, Paula Hawkins!"
I couldn't get enough of this book and wanted to keep reading to until the end.  3 different women narrate this story and it's a great way to see all of their opinions and well as how they come to find out the twist in the story.  O look forward to reading more from this author.  A must read before seeing the movie.
"The most difficult way of constructing the web of this thriller. While reading the book I felt angry at Rachel for not stopping her drinking, her lies, cries and excuses for her behaviour as if she was a real person I knew. It transformed fiction into reality. I felt happy when this character redeemed her life to sanity."
"Great story. I appreciate books where the characters are not all beautiful and simple - this one is filled with ordinary people. The protagonist in this book is basically a good person albeit flawed. The story is quite dark as the character takes the reader along on her attempt to solve a confusing mystery. Her personality is so well developed that I found myself really caring about what happened to her. I gave the book to my wife, who then recommended it to my daughter. We all loved it and look forward to seeing the movie."
"What a thrilling read and ride of a novel!The story alternates between the points of view of three women: Rachel, Anna, and Megan. Rachel is probably the protagonist (her story and p.o.v. appear first, leading the novel), and every day on the commuter train to London she passes her old home. Framed by the train's windows to and from the capital, she sees some characters she knows in this little Northern London suburb, and some she doesn't. Not unlike Rear Window, she thinks she has the tail end of a misdeed and tries to right it. But Rachel, for reasons that are immediately clear, is a highly unreliable narrator.You think you know whodonit, you don't. Very satisfying novel from a writer who has taken some time to craft fine sentences and actually use the English language.I suspect a wide swath of readers will be satisfied by this noir."
"I literally hated the other book...the one this gets compared to so often. But the only thing I hated about these characters is how obsessed they were with being thin or fat, smooth or splotchy, sexy or dull. The story was very good. I doubted all of them, but not as much the one who did it all."
"It's a real page-turner! The writer puts you there--on the train--and you can see what Rachel sees. My mother used to take me into New York by train when I was a little girl as a special treat. We too, passed the back yards of all those expensive homes. So this book took me back to those train rides with my mother."
Couldn't put it down. Unexpected ending.
I almost didn't get this book because of the negative reviews but if you stick with it you'll enjoy it as I did. None of the three main characters (who are telling the story) are particularly likeable but they do have a very dark tale to tell and  you can't help but be pulled into it and want see it to the end. Some surprises here and it did take a bit longer than usual to figure out who-done-it. The ending was improbable but I don't think too implausible. Gove it a try.
"I am not much for criminal story's, but this one was very good. It hold me woken through the whole story and it was hard to put it away. The plot is good even though I did find out very soon who the murder was, but  they way the book is written is genius, having the points of view from three persons is brilliant."
"I enjoyed this book, though I wish the characters had been differentiated a bit more. It was probably on purpose, showing how suburban and similar the characters are, as well as demonstrating the attraction to certain ""types"" that we all show. Quick tip: pay attention to the dates at the beginning of each chapter!"
"Great book! Haven't seen the movie yet, but from watching previews I could tell that the details and character building in the book are way more in-depth than portrayed on screen. That's always the case though. :) Give the book a shot even if you've seen the movie. It's a great suspenseful read."
"This started a little slow for me but I soon got into it. This is a psychological thriller and Hawkins is relentless as she makes the reader worry over the characters. Who is telling the truth? Whose memories are faulty. I read a couple of bad reviews of this book before I read it but heard so much hype I just had to find out for myself and am glad I did. The climax is one of the best I have read in a while. Rachel, the girl on the train will linger on with me for a while. Good stuff!"
"This was a difficult book for me to get through.  While the story was well developed, the characters were unlikeable to me and the main character was so lost I wanted to start drinking about half-way through the book in order to finish it.  The twists and surprises in the end made the book well worth ready.  The story is well written but, again, I really didn't like the main characters very much."
"I really loved this book. The 3 lead female characters were so well written, I just wanted to shake some sense into them because they're, well, awful people! But then in the next few pages you may feel sympathy for them.I think it was a great read, suspenseful, and kept me guessing. Great ending too."
Five stars.  I never knew what was going to happen and it was always a surprise.  A very good book.
"The Girl on the Train has been widely compared to Gone Girl, but I wouldn't stop there. This book has a familiar pattern of intrigue and mystery shared by many similar novels. The characters are well-rounded and interesting. The biggest similarity in this novel to Gone Girl is the balance of women who are vulnerable, yet strong. I especially enjoyed the way the story was told from each character's internal dialog. I finished it in a single sitting, drawn in by the complexity of the protagonist, compelled to follow her on her adventure."
"This book is REALLY slow in the beginning. I can't help but to compare this to Gone Girl which I liked much better as I found it more surprising and moved quicker. However, the last third of the book is great. It moves fast and pulls you in. You just have to get through the first half to two-thirds of the book to really enjoy it."
"The book although well-written in parts was stunningly boring filled with loser characters I could not wait to leave. I am a fast reader but had to struggle to read it because I hated it. I read two other books while trying to struggle through it. Why read a book where you do not care about a bunch of unpleasant, self-centered people leading boring useless lives -- just because one of them gets murdered?"
"Rachel once had what she thought was a perfect marrriage. Now she struggles with alcoholism,  as she lives with a trusted friend and recounts and romantcizes the details that led to her destruction. On her train rides to town, the people in their homes can be seen, a canvas from which to imagine or witness acts that entice Rachel to dream.When a couple Rachel sees from the train are in trouble, Rachel reveals that she saw a strange man kiss the wife before the wife went missing and the husband is a suspect. Rachel's tenacity peels back layers of the truth...but with the most unimaginably horrid consequences...yet, a journey worth taking."
Awesome read. Had a hard time putting the book down. Loved that the author wrote in the first person with all the female characters. Made me feel like I was there experiencing it for myself. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good thriller/mystery. Five stars all the way.
"I am not much for criminal story's, but this one was very good. It hold me woken through the whole story and it was hard to put it away. The plot is good even though I did find out very soon who the murder was, but  they way the book is written is genius, having the points of view from three persons is brilliant."
"A short review: I had this on my Kindle and finally decided to read it since it's been on the Best Seller list for quite some time. I finished it, read every word, but ended up thinking I should have read a book that had some redeeming value. It wasn't bad, but so morose. After a while I was tired of hearing about Rachael and her blackouts, alcoholic bouts, and creepy stalking of her ex. At one point I think I actually said ""MOVE ON"". I figured out the perp about 7/8 of the way though but that was fine. It was just the constant slow paced dragging on of Rachael that made me give it less than a great score. No one was what they seemed, everyone seemed to have some horrible backstory. I was disappointed, but I'm not sure what I expected anyway. Yes, I can see some comparisons to Gone Girl, but that had way more twists. Both were really the most un uplifting stories I have read in years."
"I found this book to read as a disorganized narrative at first.  I had trouble getting into it as much of the first section emphasized the ""girl's"" deterioration and alchoholism..  It may have been necessary to support the ""surprise"" ending but it seemed tedious."
I had heard good things about this book not having any idea what it was about I decided to read it! Boy am I glad I did. Once I picked up the book I couldn't put it down! I found myself totally engrossed in it! I did find it occasionally hard to follow especially with dates and timelines! Sometimes I would forget which character the chapter was about but for the most part it was very well done and I really enjoyed it!
"Every one of the characters is messed up. There is this range of emotion you feel sorry, sad, mad and you just want to shake each one of them until the get their act together. About 3/4 way through I pretty much figured out the murderer. I do recommend this book it will keep you guessing for  a while."
"I'm not crazy about first person novels, but this was probably one of the best first person murder mysteries I've ever read. I highly recommend it. Not only is it a great story and a great mystery, there is some amazing insight into alcoholism and narcissistic relationships. Get this book....and read it."
I really liked this book. It was a bit hard to get into at first. The morning and evening accounts of the train rides to and fro the city made me think the whole book was going to be written in that format. It was suspenseful and well written. The characters were well developed. Glad I read it before the movie came out. I will definitely watch the movie but think be book was good.
"I found the main character, Rachel, so pathetic at first that I wasn't sure if I would be able to finish this book.  Since it was was selected by our book club, I pushed myself to keep reading.  It did get better but was pretty predictable. The story is about a women who watches a couple from the morning train while she commutes into London.  She watches them out on their back patio and has made up fictional names and fictional lives for them.  One day she sees something that doesn't look right to her and this puts her in a tailspin.  Her ex-husband happens to live a few doors down from this couple with his new wife that he left Rachel for in her old house.  This complicates things because she cannot let go of the fact that she is still in love with her ex so she ends up stalking him which puts her in a position to stalk the other couple as well.  There are lots of twists to the story but I saw a lot of them coming before they happened."
"I enjoyed this book, though I wish the characters had been differentiated a bit more. It was probably on purpose, showing how suburban and similar the characters are, as well as demonstrating the attraction to certain ""types"" that we all show. Quick tip: pay attention to the dates at the beginning of each chapter!"
"Paula Hawkins tells a story that left me feeling that the situation is one in which I, and many women I know, could have found ourselves back when we were in our late 20's and early 30's.  It is an intriguing but very sad story that confirms how the choices we make can end up engulfing us and dragging down like quicksand.  We can make promises to change every morning when we wake up from a tough night, or when we find ourselves in a situation that we know is not where we should be.  Until we have the conviction to make the changes, we will continue the descent from which there might not be a return.  The main female characters all have character flaws from which they could have escaped with trust and determination.  They were not strong enough to do so.  This is a very sad, but quick and good read with a twist at the end that I did not see coming until it was upon me.  Great reading for vacation days!"
"It took about half way through the book for it to finally get a little more exciting but then after it starts unravelling, i couldnt put it down. I needed to ""know"". The characters are all pretty much dusturbing, and building them up was a long start, but then you get invested in guessing who could be the killer."
"I absolutely loathe having to push myself to finish a book and that is exactly what this book is forcing me to do.  I'm sad and annoyed that I spent the money on this one, which is why I feel the need to read to the end.  All of the characters are annoying, thin, shallow, and fairly bland.  The main character is amazingly stupid with her constant whining about messing up and then doing the same things over and over.  The worst part is having to read the same scenes and thoughts repeatedly . . . talk about boring!  I saw the ending after the first couple of chapters, but kept telling myself ""no, this has to get better than that!""  It didn't.  I'm honestly surprised and appalled that so many people enjoy this book.  It's nothing new or interesting past the free preview section, in fact it's just more of the same contrived garbage all the way to the obvious and bland ending.  Where are the good and enjoyable novels anymore?  Not here, I can promise you that!"
"Complete read in 3 days.  And I kept living my everyday abnormal life!!  Sometimes the hype of these best sellers does not meet great expectations, but be assured Hawkins novel is worth the time and price. Granted being on the colonist side of the pond you will need to expand your lexicon to include those of the esteemed Brits. No problem. It is set in another country and the culture is part of the plot (Be damned Harry Potter and the sellout that Americans would not take to ""Philosopher""). There are similarities to ""Gone Girl "". But the plot in no way is close  This is a psycho thriller. No reader can be sure which character is telling the truth in their version of events. Truth be told I love when an author challenges me to find the truth. Where does it lie? With you my dear reader to be frustrated with twists and satisfied with a denouement so often lacking in modern day thrillers."
"In my opinion it has a slow beginning. It consists of three main characters, but it goes back and forth in time which is hard to keep up when you don't have time to read the book in one sitting. Somehow you kind of know who the killer is, but you want to read the entire book. Interesting. First time reading Paula Hawkins."
"I'll be straight, the beginning is a little confusing with the way that the chapters are split between a few different people, but once you start to piece together who everyone is... WOW. Thrilling, heart-breaking, gory, and exciting from start to finish. Would recommend definitely! Will read again!"
"I enjoyed this book. I could not put it down. The ending was quite a surprise, but not abrupt. It was a story well told and developed with very realistic, complex, intelligent characters that I related to and had sympathy for. I can't wait to see the movie!!One tip - make sure to notice the dates that appear before each section - it's important!"
"Book was great. Kindle Fire has since frozen and Amazon won't replace it. It is just over a year oldand have had several issues. I will not buy from Amazon again.They do not value their customers. The supervisor said, There is nothing more I can do and am ending this call. And she hung up on me.  Spent alot of money for nothing. VERY DISAPDISAPPOINTED AND FRUSTRATED.  A vey unhappy customer and I will tell everyone my story"
"Read this straight through in a flash.  Kept my interest to be sure.  Love the  ""Brit English.""  I did a lot of underlining (slashing at the pages with a quickly aimed pencil) as phrases and descriptors so often seemed literally to be worthy of note. In my mind, those marks were my gestures of reinforcement of the writer.  When I ""get big"" I hope to write as well as Hawkins.Only found one typo.  As a professor, I seem always to be in an editing frame if mind."
"Three women, none of them terribly reliable, narrate the story of one of their disappearances and the men left to worry and blur the edges. In a tone reminiscent of Gone Girl, Hawkins' debut novel trucks in characterizations without much to recommend or cheer for save for the pathetic antics of its chief protagonist Rachel. The novel set in contemporary times alternatives between the female actors, from their unique points of view, building in tension to a rather satisfying conclusion."
By then midway point of this book I couldn't connect with nor did I like any of the characters. I suppose I am to feel sympathy for Rachel but she did just seem to be too desperate and wanting to be in the middle of everything. What I did like were the hidden aspects and the surreal quality to the plot so while this may not be for everyone the plot will keep you interested to the end.
"I know I was supposed to enjoy this book, but I did not. It took me over two months to work thru the first 80% bc it was just too slow, finally I got hooked and finished the last 20% in one night. It was the first book I considered quitting, but I'm glad I stuck it out."
"I'm just not a huge fan of the trend we're in with overly flawed, unlikable lead characters. For me, it made it very hard to give a flying flip if this character accomplished anything or even made it to the end of the novel. Also, the whole novel hangs (and twists) on the convenience of alcoholism and blackouts, which in itself is an extremely flawed theory."
The strong voices of the characters kept me hooked to this book.  Quick read but I felt the depth of details kept the book moving forward at a slow walk to the long awaited finality of Megan's death at the end of the book.  A bit predictable but loved it nonetheless.  Felt the tone to be similar to books like Gone Girl.  I would highly recommended.
"I purchased the audio book because I listen to them to and from work.  If I had bought the book I would have had a very hard time putting it down.  It draws the reader into it as three women speak of their days and you learn how they are enter twined.  I loved it and wouldn't hesitate buying another book by this author.As for the violence, and sexual content it's very minimal.  For me it enhances the background lives of the women."
"Book becomes very confusing if you don't read the chapter titles - they have the narrator's name. The title type is a dull grey in the kindle version. I am sure most people read chapter titles, but not everyone. They should have been made more obvious - at least black font in the kindle version. I lent my Mom my kindle book and she was unnecessarily utterly confused thinking it was a multiple personality book. Otherwise, this was a very well-written book."
"The story starts slow and a little confusing, but soon enough you're caught up in Rachel's fantasy life then Tom and Anna's betrayal.Then things start to happen...I highly recommend you read this book before the movie is too old and the cat's out of the bag.Good adult mystery."
"The Girl on the Train was not a terrible read, but it wasn't exactly great. The narrative is quick and absorbing, but the characters are almost annoying, with the same annoying sort of repetitive behaviour. I can see why it was a Best Seller, it works well as a quick read and a good distraction from everyday life and train rides."
"It bothers me that they compare this book to Gone Girl, as the ending to Gone Girl was terrible and the characters unlikeable. This book has a great ending and you feel bad for Rachel and her misfortunes. The audiobook was excellent as well with great narrators. I'm excited to see the movie this Fall (I skipped the Gone Girl movie). Highly recommended!"
"I am not a fan of this book. The characters fit into negative gender-based roles. The women are weak, insecure, and depend upon men for validation. The men are violent and controlling. The writing is not terrible, but it is a very easy read. I was able to finish the book in two days. You can skim right through and not miss much. So overall, very poor character development with not much substance."
This book could not hold my interest. Don't know if it was the writing or the story . Did not finish the book
Narrative in the first person is the best especially since this story goes back and forth between the two central female characters and follows a different timeframe with each chapter. Author's prose is such that it is easy to follow and you can visualize the characters in each setting.  No spoiler alerts here !  Can't wait for the movie this Fall!
"Although I did figure out some of the plot lines, I still found it very compelling and it definitely was hard to put down.  I know the movie is coming out soon so I'm glad I got to read it before seeing the movie--although since I saw the trailer before I read the book, it kind of ruined my own image of the main character."
"The alcoholic black-out experiences are well-written: tangible, accurate, thought-provoking.  But that's just not enough to make up for a predictable plot and derivative character development.  All three females have the same sense of being incomplete without the overbearing, controlling male; and both major male characters oblige."
"I have never read a book like this. At first I thought, this is weird. This person who watches from the train is nuts. And perhaps she is. Then as the story unfolds, you begin to understand that,yes, she is off, but in an understandable way. The things she has been through and how she has survived them in anyway mentally intact, is a miracle. I found that I kept on reading until I finally was done. I was exhausted. Good book. It took quite awhile to get into the story."
"This book was o.k. Neither fantastic nor horrible, just somewhere in the middle. It's definitely not as good as Gone Girl. I figured out who did it about half way through so the rest of the book felt like it was dragging a little. I wouldnt say this book wasn't worth the time it took read it but don't go into it expecting it to top Gone Girl because it won't. If you have a few days with some time on your hands, give it a try."
"I know most people really love this story. I'm just not one of them. I hated every page.  The writing was fine, the story was fine- I just really really hated the story.  I thought the main character was pathetic and I couldn't wait for it to be over.  Unfortunately it took ages to read because I could always put it down."
"I don't normally read this type of book, but decided to give it a try after my sister loved the movie. I like to read a book before I see the movie so I know what is missing in the movie. This book was hard to put down, I read it until my eyes couldn't focus any more, then started again the next morning."
"I loved this sad and gripping book and couldn't pit it down. Wish it had taken the protagonist into recovery. It was so real in lots of ways e.g the portray of an active alcohol but unreal in other important ways,especially about the relationships except for the one with her friend and landlord. The end has a twist that spoils it a bit"
"She is real and has so many flaws, yet you root for her to stop drinking, to remember to figure it all out. An insight to the soul of an alcoholic and the people that care for them."
"I'm still not sure how this book got onto ANY bestseller list. The writing is juvenile and the plot is weak! It's only saving grace is that it is a quick read. But for me, it's still three nights' worth of reading time that I will NEVER recover. If you like totally cheesy lifetime movies, this book is right up your alley!"
"I'd read several reviews that said the reader was kept guessing until the very end. Well, I had it figured out before the end but it still held my interest all the way through. Some of the negative reviews talk about how all of the characters are so unlikable. I personally think that's what made the story so good. Who wants to read a suspense about bubbly, pristine, boring characters? It's dark, but fascinating. Fast paced and well written -- pure entertainment."
Excellent book. It took a little while for the story to pull me in but eventually it did. When it did it was hard to put it down. I look forward to comparing the book with the movie. Maybe this time the movie will measure up somewhere close to the book. It hasn't happened yet but I can still hope.
"Full of surprises and twisty in the beginning. Because of this it was hard to predict the ending. Some of the characters were highly developed complex and interesting, one or two were less so and sort of stereotypical. But overall, I could not wait to finish the book and enjoyed every minute!"
"Like ""Gone Girl,"" this book has been on the Best Seller list for several months. It's a psychological thriller, but won't hold you captive, like say, a Stephen King book. It was more enjoyable than ""Gone Girl,"" even through the characters were just as unlikable. These people all have issues - drinking, spousal cheating, homicidal tempers - all tossed into the stew. It's quick-paced and I finished it within a couple of nights."
"Listened to this great murder mystery through Amazon Audible.  it was so compelling, I found myself sitting in the car to continue listening even after arriving at my destination.  There are three separate voices throughout the book, representing three main characters; each one different; they are woven together at the finish."
"Very cleverly written story with slow building tension.  Was not sure it would turn out to be such a fascinating read after the first chapter, was not liking the main character.  But readers...stick with it, it is so worth the effort!  The author as collected a group of characters that are human, not perfect, just trying really hard to be better people. A book has to be really great to get me to do a review, and I'm stopping here so I don't give anything away."
"This book is definitely not a happy book!  The characters are all depressed and depressing. In spite of that, it really draws you in. The ending is both surprising AND expected. I could not put it down once I was into it! Give it a try if you like suspense!"
"The author's point of view is unique and very engaging.  This is a ""who-done-it"" told by an untrustworthy source, and that source is the only one who can figure out what happened.  It's not a perfect novel but it is very engrossing and very different.  It makes you think, and guess, and then reassess, before you finally have the whole picture."
"I don't  know how this became a best-seller. It took me over half the book to start getting interested in it. It is almost all stream of consciousness of the 3 main characters, and ""the girl"" is so obsessed with her ex and the neighbor that she just seems to antagonize everyone else. I was just glad when it was over just because it finally ended."
So many GREAT  reviews but it wasn't great but  GOOD. It was sort of predictable. I have read better thrillers but I enjoyed it for the most part.
"Too much back and forth, this one and that one. I was confused at first. Took me awhile to get into this book. I wanted to read it to see the movie."
"A quick read with a fast-paced story told from the perspective of three different female characters. The author does a great job drawing you into the lives of the primary character before introducing the other two female leads, and their perspectives. The alternating points of view helps build the suspense in this who-did-it mystery featuring the darker side of human romantic relationships."
I could not put this book down once I started reading it.  It was enthralling and masterfully planned.  The way it was formatted as individual perspectives from each character as the story unfolded can only be described as genius.  I am certainly looking forward to the next book from this author.
"I bought this book when Hurricane Matthew came into town. Hoping to hunker down with a good book. It's been two weeks since the hurricane and I can't get thru half of the book. It's horrible, predictable, slow and depressing. This is all i have to say. Do not waste your money...maybe the movie will be better."
"Took a bit to get into it but we'll worth it. I had to stop and think from which character I was reading from throughout the book. However, it added a personal perspective from each character that would have been lost if it was written from just one perspective. I highly recommend this fast and involved read."
"It was gripping from start to finish. A brilliant book to choose for a book club as there is so much to talk about.....the characters are so complex and one waits to find out what hideous things are going to happen next. It is so well constructed that you are just waiting for the next event to take place!! Without giving too much away, it comes with a husband who has a problem with women and that is not fully understood until it is too late!!!"
"I had to listen to this after reading so many reviews. I can't say I loved the book. It left me with the same heavy feelings as ""Gone Girl"" and in my opinion it was this years equivalent. It was very suspenseful and I highly recommend reading or listening to especially since the narrators did such a spectacular performance."
I just really felt like it tood forever to get to the point and some of the details at the end just didn't make sense. I was interesting and I did stay up till 2AM to finish... I'm just not sure I'd recommend it. I felt like I was in the mind of totally crazy people!
"I wasn't going to read this after reading the reviews, but something about the plot just piqued my interest and I gave in. So glad I did! This book kept me on my toes and guessing up until the last minute, I loved it. Readers really have to pay attention however because there are many different perspectives to follow. The overall story may be a teenie bit cliche but it's so brilliantly told that it doesn't even matter. I recommend this incredibly engaging book, you won't regret it."
"I always get overly optimistic when I learn that books will be made into a motion picture. I expect them to be great books that you can't put down and the movie will add to the greatness! Well, I'm disappointed, the book is okay but there is nothing so awesome that it warrants a movie. In the end it became sappy and predictable. Meh"
"To be honest I felt the story line was a little long, to much back and forth. That been said I see why now it had to be that way. Great twist at the end (cork screw and all) Tom and Megan hidden well read it again and bet we can see it. Rachel and Anna saw the only way out and took it. Rachel is bad ass great."
"This book made me think a lot about alcoholism, PTSD, mental illness, how much one should be involved in others' lives - how so many people cope. Also has me thinking about the reliability or not, of memories and how susceptible we are to some one else telling us what happened, how we behaved - there is no ""what really happened"". It's about what we perceive and commit to memory.  I listened to this on Audio and loved the 3 voices of the women."
"I could not connect to this book, and therefore never choose to finish it. Not my kind of reading. I feel that I wasted my money and time by downloading and trying to read it. It had no value tome what so ever."
Trying to get through this book was like waiting for paint to dry.  I share the opinion of many readers depicting the shallowness of the characters.  At times I wanted to reach through the pages and strangle Rachel.  What a bunch of narcissistic twits.
"I have always enjoyed English mysteries. Was not familiar with the author, but found myself reading without being sure of the villain until close to the end held my attention"
"I had read some reviews and believed this would be a good read.  Maybe, but not for me.  I found it annoyingly pathetic.  I just could not like any of the characters nor identify with them.  I finished it as I was hoping for a good ending.  No such luck"
This book was a little hard to get into at first. The characters jumped from person to person so it was a little hard to follow. Great twist at the end and things finally came together.
"The book took me about 50 pages to get into it, then I could not put it down. I bought this because I saw a movie was being made, but I must say, the book is way better. I did not see the twist that occurred. I thought it was great. If you like suspense/mystery/twists, this is a great book."
"I found the book dark, depressing, and none of the characters likable.  I read it for my book club, and none of the book club members liked the book.  Some said they wouldn't have finished it if they didn't need to discuss with the other book club members.  A few said that they kept reading because they wanted to know how it ended.  None of us understood why it's such a big seller."
"I found this book to be boring, confusing and contrived. A story mainly about alcoholism and how it can destroy people's lives. The women in this story are all dealing with some kind of loss and they all seem to be searching for something but they don't know what it is. The author did not make me feel sympathetic towards these women and at times I felt I was wasting my time reading this book."
"Initially I had a difficult time keeping characters and time straight. The plot demands careful attention to each character, whether real or imagined.I was engaged with certain characters  more than others because of their stories. I never reached a point where I could not put the book down. For me that was a real plus; i took the time to think about what I had just read. Characters were interesting and their dilemmas were believable."
"I'm not crazy about first person novels, but this was probably one of the best first person murder mysteries I've ever read. I highly recommend it. Not only is it a great story and a great mystery, there is some amazing insight into alcoholism and narcissistic relationships. Get this book....and read it."
"Amazing book, crappy ending. I finished this book in 2 days. I couldn't put it down but the ending left me perplexed. The characters are all jerks. The story is great, it just felt like the ending was rushed and that last line. Really??  I would suggest it because it is a good read, just not what I thought it would be!!!"
When I first heard about this book I really wanted to read it but I felt that the cost for the ebook version was not worth it. Then I watched the previews for the movie and I couldn't wait any longer so I bought the book. I'm so glad I did. The book is a bit confusing at first but it certainly keeps you guessing.
"I liked the book.  It was a fun read with some twits to it and keeps you guessing ""who did it"" from chapter to chapter.  My only complaint is that I wish there was a little more background on the killer and as to why this person became like this.  I felt there was a ton of background on all the characters except for the KILLER!!  so the ending left me a little unsatisfied since I did not understand why he acted this way and why nobody realized it?"
"Depressing sometimes, but honest just the same"
"This was a solid novel. There was a ton of hype surrounding it so after reading quite a few reviews, I bought it.While it was a decent read, I don't get the hype. I spent 3/4 of the book waiting for something to happen.i started and stopped about a hundred times but it was OK. The comparisons to Gone Girl really need to stop."
"My problem with this novel was that all of the characters are really messed up. Either by addictions, abuse, infidelity, broken marriages, unemployment etc. etc which dominate every step of the tedious journey toward knowing which one ultimately is the most messed up of all. I liked the structure of the book which is quite clever in its individual presentations of events as experienced by each of the characters.This was probably wmaintained my interest toward the end.."
"This was recommended by Amazon as I enjoyed Gone Girl. This novel is told by three people. Each chapter is by one of them. The ex-wife, Rachel; the new wife Anna; and the neighbor Megan.The story is good throughout, however the ending ended so quick. When confronted, the murderer immediately confessed and gave all the details of the crime. No real suspense at the end.Is a good book, just a horribly written ending."
"This rather short novel starts off in an intriguing way, a woman living vicariously through the imagined lives of strangers she sees on the way to work. Unfortunately, it devolves into a rote thriller with a rather tedious conclusion with the villain explaining everything to the hero. The main character Rachel is quite interesting, and her struggles with depression and alcoholism deserve a better story."
"I'm sure I add nothing by telling you this book is good, but it is--very, very good.And ""easy"" read is a compliment. I tend to get bogged down with non-fiction, and sometimes I want a book that is more enjoyable. This is such a book. I was tired at work on Monday, but I had to read through the night. I couldn't put it down! :)"
It took me a while to get in to this book. I couldn't get a handle on the three women's stories nor the timeline in the beginning. Eventually I was able to track the three women's perspectives maybe halfway through the book once the plot started to thicken. I kept with the book and enjoyed the intrigue & mystery towards the end...
"Truly, one of the worst books I've read in years. Though it tries to be suspenseful, it is simply chaotic – yet fashionably predictable. The writing leaves a lot to be desired. I'm sure the film will be different, but I simply cannot recommend this book. It took a lot of will to finish it."
"A plot that weaves back and forth between three women. Their shortcomings and actions make for a very intricate story involving the men in their lives as well as divorce, alcoholism and infidelity. This book is a fast read and almost making the reader wonder what is around the next curve. Highly recommend"
"I really enjoyed this story.  I loved the alternating perspectives.  It kept me guessing throughout as well, which I love.  I highly recommend...and not, I have not seen the movie."
"Though the book has dominated the NYT bestseller list for months, I was not impressed.  From an English mystery, I expected more color, an eccentric sleuth with more expertise, a distinctive setting, a little charm, perhaps a dash of humor;  instead, Train offers an alcoholic slouch with a dreary commute to nowhere.  The biggest mystery in the book is the heroine's blackouts.  The murder is so banal, without passion and inept that it is literally a crime committed without a trace of motive or evidence.  The heroine, generally in a drunken stupor, has some encounters of interest but mostly stumbles around totally clueless and solves the mystery completely by accident.  The accidental solution to the clueless mystery, finally gives readers a taste of redemption and a glimpse of evil.  This is not a case of leaving the best for last; those ingredients could have spiced up the tale and made the ride less tedious."
"If Eric Bentley was right, and melodrama is fueled by the amount of fear it generates, then this is a successful melodrama. These women are all but literally tied to the train tracks in their shared London neighborhood. Their relationships are sharply rendered but shallow; there is betrayal, hand-wringing, abandonment, posturing villainy, and pathological obsession with all things superficial--body shape, real estate, reproductive success, chemical vice, and sexual virtue. Infidelity and sexual adventurism remain punishable by death (for women only). This story's twists and characterizations are so broad and archetypical that it could be told in pantomime. Luckily for us, it's told in really excellent prose; Paula Hawkins has a lot of fun with this problematic potboiler, and so did I."
I gave it 5 stars because it deserved it.  Plenty of twists and turns. Plenty of anxiety.  Nothing is scarier than not knowing about what has happened to you.  Wondering w h at you might have done. Might have seen. Might have felt.  It's all gone just some quick flashes of memory.
"Loved this book - couldn't put it down. It's not five-star the way a Henry James novel is, but it is five-star for its genre - a just-perfect mystery that leaves you guessing until the end. It was a perfect book to fill the Christmas-to-New Year's lull. What's more, I no longer look at people I know the same way - I keep wondering what's behind their facades! Having worried that the book was going to be just another Gone Girl, I can happily say it was better than that book - more believable, less preposterous. A great, fun read."
When I first heard about this book I really wanted to read it but I felt that the cost for the ebook version was not worth it. Then I watched the previews for the movie and I couldn't wait any longer so I bought the book. I'm so glad I did. The book is a bit confusing at first but it certainly keeps you guessing.
"I've read Gone Girl and now The Girl on the Train.  I never understood why Gone Girl got such great reviews as it was poorly written and not the least bit original.  Paula Hawkins got it right.  This was an enjoyable read and one of the few ""chick"" books I've ever read that I enjoyed.  I did find the book a bit confusing at first because of the changing both of the characters and the year that events occurred.  Other than that, a fun read all the way,"
"It's been a while since I have enjoyed a thriller, this one was one of the best I've read in a while. I also purchased the audio it adds another level of suspense. I haven't seen the movie I wanted to read the book first, although the mental images that have emerged from the writing makes me feel I have."
"This one kept me turning the pages.  It presents you with a cast of characters who's lives have touched.  They are all woven together by the relentless imagination of one alcoholic and tragically lonely women, Rachel.  While you know that she has an active imagination you go right along with her as she attempts to make sense out of her rudderless life.  She manages to drag her ex-husband and his family into her drama and a couple that lives a few doors down as well.  Every day brings just a little more information to the light.  But what is true and what has her mind made up?  It is a page turner and when one of the characters goes missing it keeps you up at night trying to reach the conclusion.  A good one.  Well worth it."
"Loved the story and it kept me on my toes. I did not want to put this book down and when it finally ended, everything was clear to me and I did not feel like there was unfinished business. I have yet to watch the movie and read this book before knowing it was going to be a film."
"Deliciously dark and twisted, like Rear Window meets Gone Girl.This story was told in three points of view: Rachel, the girl on the train, Anna, the woman now married to Rachel's ex-husband, and Megan (aka Jess), a seemingly happy woman who Rachel observes from the train every day and who mysteriously goes missing one fateful Saturday night.I was entranced by the narration, by the way these three women's stories came together at the end in a completely unexpected way. I never quite knew what was going to happen next!There were so many lies, secrets, and truly despicable characters. Rachel ended up being my favorite, which I didn't see happening at the beginning. She was an unreliable narrator, and witness, but the way she pieced her patchwork memory together and arrived at the truth was so entertaining.I docked it a star because the story dragged a bit in the middle, but overall this was a well-written and supremely engaging psychological thriller.One of my favorite quotes, which in retrospect describes the story itself: ""That's what I've taken from the therapy sessions: the holes in your life are permanent. You have to grow around them, like tree roots around concrete; you mould yourself through the gaps."""
"I thought this book would be great based on the reviews but I found the main character very unrelatable and as the author continually changes the perspective and dates, the flow of the story becomes choppy. I only give it 3 stars because of the twist in the very end, the rest of the story leading up to that point gets 2 starts."
"Read fairly quickly as I did want to find out whodunnit. Jumps back and forth in time which is slightly annoying but I can see why she wrote it that way.  I read on the Kindle and the chapter titles don't exactly jump out at you, so I got a little confused until I figured out that I needed to read the title of the chapter to understand who was speaking and when it was happening.  The constant drunkenness got a little tiresome. You really want the main character to stay sober but it's a fairly realistic depiction of the one step forward, two steps back of addiction recovery."
"It was a great book, page turner, and when I wasn't able to read I was using the narrator as I drove down the street. I have had a terrible time finding something that even comes close tot his book since. It was very suspenseful with believable characters. If you like suspense you will like this book."
I read this book because it referred to me by someone who loved it. However I was so bored pretty much during the whole thing. I feel like it dragged on and on in the same position for the 1st part of the book. The end was the most exciting part and with that wasn't that great. But it is just my opinion. I would not recommend it.
"Though not normally my kind of genre, I mainly read this book to see what all the fuss was about. Although I enjoyed it, I’m still not sure why it took off like a rocket. At about the 2/3 mark, I started to get annoyed with the heroine and wanted to shake her by the shoulders and tell her to pull herself together fer cryin’ out loud. But then I realized what Hawkins had done. She’d wormed her protagonist into my brain and made me care enough to get me mad. Then I started to appreciated the feat she’d pulled off and was glad I’d read it. Yeah...okay...maybe I get it now..."
"I had started to read Gone Girl, but, didn't finish it because I thought the characters were pathetic people. Which, by the way, takes very good writing. But, it didn't work for me. Partway through The Girl On The Train, I thought I had another Gone Girl on my hands. No way!! I could not stop reading this book. At first I thought Rachel was just a sad, pathetic person, but, as I read more I saw the depth to her character. There are plot twists and surprises I never saw coming. I was impressed with the book. I never read books that someone ""recommends"", whether that person is a friend, celebrity, or book critic. But, my daughter told me that she heard this was good, so, I gave it a try. By the way, my daughter has the audible version and it quite impressed with the work of the voice actors and the story itself. I totally loved this book. I would read something else by this author."
"I really had no idea what to expect, I had only just learned from the movie coming out, there was a book. I had seen the previews for the movie and couldn't wait to watch it. I'm so glad I read the book! Twists and turns and more twists. Suspense, sadness and crazy! I wasn't able to put it down. Love it!"
"I didn't like this book on several levels.  None of the three main female characters were in the least likeable--all unemployed self absorbed whiners; by mid-book I was hoping they would all be victims of a serial killer.  After the murderer is revealed, it's (I won't say he or she) character is somewhat hamhandedly portrayed.  I finished it by skimming through a lot of the tedious dialogue.  Can't believe there's talk of making it into a movie.  I did like the premise of the voyeuristic train ride, but that's about it."
"Rachel is the character that the story revolves around.  She travels on a train in the UK every day and the train stops at the same place each day.  She watches a couple making up her own story of their lives.  She ultimately gets involved in those lives as well as her ex-husband's life.  He and his new wife live on the same street as the couple she watches.  She is an alcoholic and a serious event happens that she can't remember because she has blacked out.  Hard to describe the interwoven characters but they all at some point revolve around Rachel.  Twists and turns galore.  Murder, adultery and more. Not only couldn't I put it down but even when I wasn't reading it I was thinking about it trying to figure things out.  In my opinion the author had to have had first hand knowledge of alcoholics and what they go through.  Rachel's struggles were just too real.  Read it!"
"I was interested in reading this after I saw the preview for the movie. I really thought I knew what the twist would be, but it still caught me off guard. A little more of a sad story than I was expecting, but it's a great murder mystery. Definitely recommended for adults."
"Loved this book so much. It was thrilling and I couldn't put it down. If you look deep into it, it teaches you how scary and terrifying narcissistic people can be. I would recommend this to anybody looking for a good read and also anybody looking for answers in their own situation. This book downstream. Amazing!"
"Loved this book! A NY times best seller, it was entertaining and a good read."
"When I first started to read this book, Girl on the Train, I was somewhat bored, so I put it down and did not return to reading it for several months. A friend encouraged me to stick with it, so I started to read it again. I didn't want to put it down; there were so many twists and turns. It was a little hard to get into, but once you did it was a very good ! I would definitely recommend it to people who like  mysteries."
"It took me awhile to get used to the way this book was written, with it going back and forth with the characters and dates.  The book was cleverly written and organized and I was surprised with every twist.  I recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys a good plot with many clever twists."
This is what you call a true novel. I loved the way the writer took time to build up the scenes. The writer also used the pen with the plot to make you think as well as talking about more in each scene. The writer makes you feel like you are in the scene and in the mind of the character.
"The book was a gift to my sister, she thoroughly enjoyed.P.S. this is not really related to the book but sort of a spoiler if you haven't seen it but in the book the main character is in London and drinks Gin and Tonic. If you see the movie she's in NY state and drinks Vodka."
"Well written novel about a neighborhood in the London suburbs near a train where a murder takes place, and how the murderer is in plain sight, but not discovered until the end of the story.  The story is told from 3 different women's perspectives, even the one who is eventually murdered."
"I enjoyed this book. Touted as a thriller, its a bit too slow. You have to take care of watching the dates on the chapters since there are occasional flashbacks, and the time line is not just moving forward. Some of the mental musings get a bit long in the tooth, but you'll know them pretty quick and you can speed read through them. Some of the usual situations that make you think some people are just incredibly stupid."
"While I couldn't wait to sit down and read this book, I was somewhat disappointed !  Having been on the NY Times Bestseller's list for weeks on end, I expected more.  The story finally took off half way through the book.  I, like most readers, want to be ""grabbed"" right from the start, this was not one of those books.  Once into it, it finally got my attention and finished with a great ending.  For those who have patience I would recommend it."
"I had made up my mind that this would be like the movie Rear Window but it was very different. Several characters get developed into suggested suspects and you just never know. What kept this from 5 stars for me is that, and maybe I'm naive, I couldn't really believe that many people in close proximity had so many issues. So, although they were hard to believe for me, that many issues made for a truly intriguing story."
"An enjoyable book to read throughout. The chapters are short, making it easy to pick up and put down as often as you want, but the further on you go the more you want to know what happens next. A definite page turner."
Loved every minute of this book. I think I finished it within 48 hours. Could not put it down.I really love a great suspense book- and this is the closest i've come to finding another book similar to Gone Girl. You will have no idea whats going on until the very last chapter.Worth every penny to buy and every minute of your day to read. Make sure you read it before the movie come out!
"Great book! The story moves back and forth in time and is told from three different perspectives but I didn't have trouble knowing where I was. I read a review of this book that mentioned ""unreliable narrators"" and that is great way to describe the narrative. Each character tells the story from their perspective, which is incomplete and skewed by their own experiences and biases. I suspected the perpetrator briefly early in the book but then discarded that notion so I was completely surprised when that character was identified. I think I suspected each major character at some point! That's a sign of a great whodunit, right?"
"Rachel, the girl on the train, has had a rough time of it.  She's definitely not where she thought she would be.  Rachel would ride the train to London every day for work, watching the houses as they passed.  One of the houses that she watched was the one that she use to share with her ex-husband.  Tom now shares that home with his former mistress, now his wife, and his infant daughter.  Four doors down, is a house just like hers use to be.  Rachel watches the couple in that house and creates an imaginary life for them in her mind.  She imagines their names, their love for each other, their life together.  Things are not as she imagines and as her drinking gets more and more out of hand, her bad decisions lead her down a dangerous path."
"I know most people really love this story. I'm just not one of them. I hated every page.  The writing was fine, the story was fine- I just really really hated the story.  I thought the main character was pathetic and I couldn't wait for it to be over.  Unfortunately it took ages to read because I could always put it down."
"Loved this book so much. It was thrilling and I couldn't put it down. If you look deep into it, it teaches you how scary and terrifying narcissistic people can be. I would recommend this to anybody looking for a good read and also anybody looking for answers in their own situation. This book downstream. Amazing!"
"I didn't read this book for the longest time because of the comparisons to ""Gone Girl"" which I hated.  I finally gave in and read it this past week, it is a great read, suspenseful, and really until the end I wasn't sure who ""done it.""  I would recommend this book, it is great thriller,"
"The intrigue, mystery, and the constant attempt to figure out who did it, surely keeps you hurrying to find out.  This is a great read and one you should consider.  I looked at it several times in my library and then passed it by.  I was compelled to give it a try and eliminate it if I didn't care for it.  Without question, it is easily one of my favorites."
"I enjoyed the book for the most part, it held my attention and I didn't want to put the book down.  I was disappointed in that there wasn't enough character development. All the females in this book are portrayed as weak and all the male characters as controlling.  Even the roommate would run to her boyfriend at the snap of his fingers.  I ended up hating every character in the book."
"This was a good novel, although I didn't get to finish the book before I saw the movie, I still say the book is always better, it just puts a face and a voice to the characters. It didn't grab my attention  (the book) like I expected it to. Over all its a food book, not a page Turner though."
"I really wanted to like this book. Its written in the first person for all the major characters so you have to keep track of which person is ""speaking"" at any point in time. Thats really not my preferred style of novel. There isnt much to the story so it progresses slowly and is repetitive. Its an ok read but nothing special"
"Although I did figure out some of the plot lines, I still found it very compelling and it definitely was hard to put down.  I know the movie is coming out soon so I'm glad I got to read it before seeing the movie--although since I saw the trailer before I read the book, it kind of ruined my own image of the main character."
"I LOVED this book. I haven' t read a full book for myself in a very long time and decided to pick this one up. Finished it in just a few days. It was good the whole time, but towards the end I could not put it down. I loved the characters and the style of writing. Easy to follow, deep, relatable, and a kind of dark/sarcastic humor as well. Amazing! I was surprised by the ending too :)"
"I'm still not sure how this book got onto ANY bestseller list. The writing is juvenile and the plot is weak! It's only saving grace is that it is a quick read. But for me, it's still three nights' worth of reading time that I will NEVER recover. If you like totally cheesy lifetime movies, this book is right up your alley!"
"This book was worse than a waste of time. Decided to keep reading this inane story due to my own stubborn tendency not to quit books in the middle. My own fault. The protagonist, Rachel, is a complete wing-nut who happens to also be an alcoholic and consciously makes the wrong decision at every opportunity with or without the aid of alcohol. She is impossible to like and her monotonous internal chatter takes up a lot of the story. Sigh. The book is fraught with maddening ""unrealities"", for instance, Rachel survives financially for days and days on a ""tenner"" that her cliche' enabler flatmate, Cathy, loaned her. Really? The enormous plot twist near the end is the kicker that has me writing this review. It was simply ridiculous. I'm left wondering how this book was ever published in the first place, and who are these people giving 4 & 5 star reviews?"
"I struggled with this book and I'll tell you why. I LOVED the story but I hated every single character. At times, they were so annoyingly needy or cruel that it was almost unbearable, not to mention unrealistic. Regardless, the plot is fantastic and kept me engaged and interested in the outcome."
"This book came so highly recommended, so it was a real disappointment to actually read it. It would have been a much better or at least easier read if just one of the main characters was likable. Alternates between three narrators--a self-pitying alcoholic; a jealous, mendacious Stepford Wife; and the morally devoid victim, whose narrative is coming from where, exactly?--each more irritating than the last (although Rachel, the unemployed, divorced, barren drunkard may take the cake)."
"Fantastic book. Characters are well developed and it's written in such a way that you can almost feel what they're feeling. I saw the movie and was disappointed in the director's take. I recommend the book BEFORE you see the movie. It's a really great, spellbinding read."
This book took a long time to really get to suspenseful and I would not consider it a thriller on any level. Most of the time is spent waiting for the main character to try to remember what happened on one of the many black out drunk episodes she experiences throughout most of the book.
"I can't for the life of me figure out why everyone is excited about this book. I'm 3/4 of the way through, and bored to tears. The characters are not interesting, likeable, or believable. Unless they did some major rewriting of the plot, the movie will be a snooze fest too. Don't waste your money."
"I found it a bit confusing because it kept jumping from character to another and after awhile the long descriptive phrases and the cornucopia of emotions were driving me crazy.  I was loosing track of all the double thinking and switch backs, then one girl kept going back trying to resurrect her life with her last husband but he is married to another woman and she has a problem with that.  No s***, I'm sorry I couldn't finish the book and went onto another.  It was well written but I lost it."
An entertaining novel that is only disturbed by the jumping around of dates from chapter to chapter.  Had to keep a note beside me to remember which person and when something was occurring.  The story is well written though the grand finale was less than a surprise.  I would suggest it to other friends.
"The Girl on the Train was a pretty engaging book.  My BFF and I are taking a ""2016 reading challenge"" and January was to be a book that was made into a movie, so this was our choice. The main character isn't very likable, in my opinion, but she doesn't need to be in order to hold your attention.  I could sympathize with her struggles to some degree, but overall she was a hot mess.  Without saying too much, I think the conclusion of the book was solid, if not a little predictable."
"The characters are under-developed and all seem to have a very similar voice. The use of changing point-of-view just does not really cut it in this book. Each character is fairly flat and about two thrids through the book, I was able to figure out ""who done it."" Or at least ""who probably done it."" I'm still glad I read it, to see what all the buzz is about, and to experience a serious writer's foray into contemporary fiction. This is not great literature; not a terribly deep story, and certainly not on par with Hitchkock thrillers. The writing is straightforward and this is a quick read; almost a page turner. Ok, I admit I turned the page rather quickly. I'd like to add that I'm rooting for Paula Hawkins as a fiction writer, in spite of my tepid review. She is smart and amazing. We will be seeing more great stuff from her."
"I rated this book as 5 Stars because it is well worth it. If the movie is anything like the book all I can say is Wow!!! Memory loss, alcohol, train rides, and old loves. Unhappy ex wife, drinks to much, tells lies, and imagines things or is it the truth. Like murder, like suspense then read this book."
"Definitely recommending this to all my friends! This mystery novel set in a London suburb is one of those can't put it down, must know what happens next, kind of thrillers. The characters are extremely complex and multi-dimensional. Throughout the book I felt very empathetic, angry, frustrated, scared; all signs of a well written book. I'll be a little more alert the next time I ride a train."
"I am still reading ""The Girl on the Train"" and enjoying it immensely, especially now that I understand that our protagonist Rachel is just one of several voices being heard. Chalk it up to my own sleep-deprivation or just inattentiveness but this simple fact eluded me and I actually thought for the first several chapters that Megan, Anna and the completely fictitious Jen were all projected personalities of crazy/drunk/depressed Rachel living vicariously through these other women. The story is very compelling and as others have said just screams ""MOVIE!"" but the reader really has to pay close attention to the chapter headings which will clue you in as to who's narrating, and the timeline which jumps all over throughout the course of several years."
"I couldn't put the book down.  I usually read on my lunch hour, but I started this book on a plane ride.  I had to read it even when the plane landed and had to continue until it reached its stunning conclusion.  I now will read every Paula Hawkins book I can get my hands on."
"It took me awhile to get into it, it seemed to drag out with same old/same old and I would get bored. Yet, once it came  together I had to stay up late to finish the book... loved the last few chapters! I decided I would rather ""see the  movie"" than read the book, which is usually the opposite for me."
"Wow, everyone was so flawed in this story but that was their saving grace. I didn't like a single character, not even Eivy. Yet I cared for every single one of them. I was connected to them by every facet of their lives.Excellent writing. A story worthy of a second read."
"Enjoyed this well-paced thriller/chiller. It was well written and was voiced by 3 women, Rachel, a complete drunken mess of a woman, Megan, not much better who had serious issues other than alcoholism, and Anna, a pathetic Stepford Wife, only wanting to stand by her man. Not as good as Gone Girl, but a good psycho thriller, nonetheless."
I didn't really enjoy this although I read it to the end.  I think that it was possibly because it was simply too dark for my tastes.
"It's been a while since I have enjoyed a thriller, this one was one of the best I've read in a while. I also purchased the audio it adds another level of suspense. I haven't seen the movie I wanted to read the book first, although the mental images that have emerged from the writing makes me feel I have."
"It was a good ""who done it"" but lacked character development. The lead character's self-pity party was a bit hard to follow through the whole book, but overall I think the author raised a few interesting points about the complexity of relationships. It was also interesting to follow the outcome of a seemingly small event that was witnessed by one individual through the repercussions it had on several lives."
"I thought the good was very good till the end. It seemed like Rachael made her life much more difficult by not sharing her thoughts and actions with the detectives and other people involved. It made her seem a little dumb.  The whole Anna, Rachael and Tom seen  as it played out was not very good in my opinion."
This book is full of surprises and twists.  If you like a good suspense twisted book then you should like Girl on the Train.  The author has some very well developed characters and she sweeps you in early in the story and holds your attention throughout the book.  What I loved is how I could not figure out which way the book was going next.
I was hooked but felt this wasn't as good as everyone was saying. It dragged on. Same thing every day narrated in the same way. I got bored but wanted to see the end. Was glad when it was over.
"It took me awhile to get into it, it seemed to drag out with same old/same old and I would get bored. Yet, once it came  together I had to stay up late to finish the book... loved the last few chapters! I decided I would rather ""see the  movie"" than read the book, which is usually the opposite for me."
"Very good, I enjoyed the various characters and how the speakers changed.  Interesting writing and point of view.  Clever setting!!I would like to have had some more explanations on Megan's history, and felt let down that that was not provided.  The hardest part of writing any book is the end and this one was a little predictable.  But I definitely would recommend this book for its creativity, focus, style and plot!"
I really just got the book to find out what the fuss was about with the movie about to release. It was slow going at first without a hint at the direction. It began to get more interesting in the second half. It did not turn out the way I expected and the wrap up was pretty gratifying. It finished strong.
"Sorry....I'm only half-way through this novel.  More later.Now completed....I'm looking forward to the planned movie.  Book lends itself to visual adaptation.  Characters on top of chaaracters will be better explained and identified visually.  My opinion only.  Did enjoy the writer' story, however.owever."
"THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is told from the first person point of view by Rachel, who imagines fantasy lives for people living in homes that she passes on the train. Living a restricted life, her daily train rides disguise that she has been fired from her job. As a heroine, Rachel is not particularly likeable. She has low self-esteem and is frequently so drunk that she has memory lapses, with one such lapse serving as a primary focal point.  Personally, the constant inebriation was overdone. Other characters, particularly the male ones, are similarly unlikeable. And when Rachel injects herself into the lives of those who had been fantasy characters, it's a bit much to accept. No doubt, this novel has become popular because of Ms. Hawkins' skill at slowly unraveling the many layers of this novel's central mystery: What happened to Megan?"
This story was a well-written mystery it only took me 2 1/2 days to read it because I couldn't put it down and took every break I had to read even a few pages at a time. I highly recommend it to anybody who's interested in thrillers that keep you guessing until the very end who is the guilty one.
"I don't like to criticize any author who spends hundreds of hours writing something for readers to enjoy.Clearly, Paula Hawkins' perseverance has paid off for her since she's been on the best seller lists for many months, so who am I to go against public opinion--and the NY Times critic?At the risk of sounding ungrateful, I have to complain a bit.Using an ""unreliable narrator"" device can be tricky. There ARE authors who handle it  really well---( A Pleasure and A Calling by Phil Hogan does this beautifully, for example. ) For me, after reaching the end of Girl on a Train, rather than being delighted at being fooled, I was annoyed.  The narrator's ""inner thoughts,"" aren't really honest ones --she holds information back from whom?  Herself? Plus  the plot has so many holes in it that even the most bumbling detective would have figured out just what went on."
"I can see why people compare it to Gone Girl, it's dark and focuses on the terrible things people do to each other, but this is different from Gone Girl. I knew a twist was coming but couldn't figure out exactly what it was until it was pretty obvious :) Great book though!"
"Obviously this is a very popular book right now. So it was on my to read list. When I got to the mystery or thriller challenge, I wanted to read this.This is a quick paced, easy to read book.I loved the relationships with Rachel and everyone else.Rachel was flawed and yet I was rooting for her. I wanted her to get it together and have a life and find someone to love her. I wanted her to have a family.Most of the way through the book, I was undecided on who did it. A little more than halfway through, I started thinking it was who it turned out to be. Little clues along the way made me begin to wonder about who it really was.I got a little worried for her safety towards the end.All in all, a fast paced, enjoyable read. A great mystery that will leave you questioning who and what all the way through."
"This is the first novel by Paula Hawkins that I have read.  It certainly won't be the last!This is a brilliantly crafted story, told by multiple characters, all of whom are unwillingly woven into this web of mystery.Rachael, the drunken ex-wife of Tom seems to be the first one to begin to  ""stir"" this story that will keep you glued to its pages right up to the end.  Be patient in the beginning, when all the characters are having their say about this ""stew.""  You won't regret it!"
"I must say I was very disappointed for a book heralded as a ""thriller."" I found this book very difficult to follow with the constant switching of 1st person narratives. And the day to day mishaps of a drunk was very laborious. Of the 323 pages only the last 30 or so were mildly ""exciting."" From the midpoint of the book on, I just kept saying ""please get to the point!!""  Others who had read it and saw me reading it would say ""hang in there, it will come together in the end."" Not my idea of  ""thriller.""  I absolutely don't understand the rave reviews, while respecting differences of opinions. Unfortunately ""buying"" the book myself adds to the undeserved hype."
I read this book in one day! At first the back and forth of having to piece time stamps and people together seemed like a lot of work. But it turned out that this made the book even more interesting and the search for clues alluring. I love a good story that keeps you guessing till the end. Totally enjoyed it.
"I did not read any of the thousands of reviews for this book. I didn't want to be distracted by what anyone else thought and make up my own mind.I found the story  disappointing. I had been excited to read it as I used to commute on the train to London when I worked there and remember peering out at the houses/gardens when we stopped along the way...As an author too, I could imagine weaving an exciting, mysterious, fictional tale around people who lived near the track, but this wasn't exciting or mysterious. I'm really not sure why this is a best seller. I didn't get a good ""feel"" for the characters, found the story too loose, a little distasteful and not really believable."
"I generally do not care for 1st person fiction of female character...after all I am from Mars.  But Paula Hawkins created four key female characters so well that I could even get it.  This is a great work of fiction with lots of suspense down to the last chapters.  I believe most will find it impossible not to read in a single sitting....its that good.  I am sure this will become a movie.  It is creative, different, suspenseful and unique.  Well done Paula."

"I am an avid reader and was excited to purchase this book (after reading so many great reviews).  This book was boring and the storyline was just disappointing to me!  The alcoholic first wife, the new wife, the neighbor wife..too many wives!  Would not recommend this to someone that likes fast paced books!"
This book was recommended by a friend.  Not my usual read...but I thought it was well written and pulled me in.  An interesting ending as well.
"A very interesting book with characters you don't really engage with and yet you are kept in suspense, wondering what would happen next. Once I got started it was hard to put down since you kept wanting to see what would happen next and were often surprised.I would recommend this book to readers but be sure you have time to read since you won't want to put it down."
"Honestly I LOVED THIS BOOK! It started off really slow, and i even had some friends tell me that they could not get through the beginning. But i loved it ! You just have to keep reading and eventually you are hooked. I would recommend this book to anyone who needs a good read. You will never see whats coming at the end."
LOVE this book. Cannot wait for the movie. I read this novel when Gone Girl was popular.  I felt that The Girl on the Train had much better character development.  When reading the two novels within weeks of the other I really enjoyed The Girl on the Train much more.  Gone Girl was a disappointment in comparison.
"A gripping and classic thriller that has you guessing until the end. Wonderfully flawed characters that you love to hate but keeps you turning the pages, tracking the timeline, and the narrator perspective, all in the effort to determine the killers identity before the author wants you to."
"This was fantastic though it shouldn't have been compared to Gone Girl. It doesn't need that. I love books with an unreliable narrator, and Rachel Watson, an alcoholic and liar is perfect. She is so self-destructive but somehow likeable. She means well and wants to help when she thinks she has information about a crime. No one believes her, of course. There are lots of twists and turns though I guessed the big reveal beforehand. It's a great book, just don't expect it to be like any other."
"I know that train and have had the experience of imagining the lives of people in their sectioned off home, people who were oblivious to me, so I felt myself riding on the train with her.  The central role of her alcoholism was distressing to me, but it certainly reminded me of why drinking too much is not a good idea.  But in this case it led to an absorbing story."
This book was easy to read and exciting. There were so many twists in the story. The beginning was confusing as the narrator changes and you don't know the characters yet but soon in to the book you get it and become hooked. I can't wait to see if the movie is as good as the book.
"that a plot-driven, page-turning yarn cannot also be well written? I admire so much about this book; the wonderful Rear Window premise, the unfolding of the narrative through three points of view, the episodic blackouts that contribute to the protagonist's (and the reader's) inability to sort fact from fiction. Ultimately, though, the novel suffers from a lack of attention to the writing itself - simple cliches, red herrings, characters who fail to maintain their own voices and crash into each other in some sort of ""sisterhood is powerful"" jingoism. Sigh."
"The previous reviewers who remarked that the voices of the three narrators/women were wholly interchangeable hit the proverbial nail on the head! That and the fact that there was no real nuance or dimension to any of the characters to begin with are the biggest disappointments about this novel. Maybe the latter is the reason there were no real distinguishing features between any of them other than their circumstances so it is really the same problem. And the characters were not believable or likable. I did, however, from time to time find myself rooting for Rachel despite her propensity for excessive apologizing and her pathetic behavior and life, and I found the story/plot itself was still a relatively engaging whodunit so I gave it three stars overall. Just don't expect it to move you in any way.  Profound this novel is not."
"Started out a little slower than I thought it would, but I knew it would pick up, and holy cow did it ever! I couldn't put it down and the description used made it totally play in my head like I could see everything! If you love psychological thrillers, this is your kind of book!"
"Listened to this great murder mystery through Amazon Audible.  it was so compelling, I found myself sitting in the car to continue listening even after arriving at my destination.  There are three separate voices throughout the book, representing three main characters; each one different; they are woven together at the finish."
"I was excited to read this book because Amazon suggested it was similar to Gone Girl. However except for the multiple point of view format, the book is not great.I had to force myself to continue reading through the poor writing. I believe a good author would use descriptive words, not generalization of moods and character based on brands.( there was a lot of name dropping, was the author beings sponsored by these companies?)The book was shallow, the characters were shallow and I felt uncomfortable with the way women were depicted as weak victims and men as testosterone driven neanderthals.I loved the premise of the book, which is the only thing that kept me reading through the events and characters that were not clever or interesting."
"At first, I didn't understand the hype around this book. I didn't like it. The beginning is really sad. The characters are all very flawed, marred by their own vices. But getting towards the end, the plot suddenly twists and everything you expected to happen doesn't. You thought you knew the characters but then you learn the truth. No one is who you think they are. You're just as surprised as the characters. The author straps you into a rollercoaster of a dramatic triumphant ending.Wow! What an exciting read!"
I was excited to start this book but the excitement quickly changed to confusion and then disappointment.  I struggled through to the finish even though it took me several times of putting it down and then picking it up again.  Would I recommend it?  No.
"If you're looking for a light and happy read this is not it! I found it to be dark, depressing and raw but completely addicting. I felt a roller coaster of emotion towards the main character from anger and repulsion to hope. The ending certainly was a surprise too! Let's hope the movie is as great as the book!"
The author tackles big real life issues with messages of strength to overcome or be overcome. I started listening on audio during a road trip but it wasn't finished once I arrived at my destination so I bought the ebook and stayed up to read it. Couldn't put it down!
I just couldn't get into this story about these women who seem to be so totally lost. They seem to be without any moral compass and aimless. So sad! I felt sorry that someone would live like that.
"A real page turner! Lots of twists & turns! The best ""who done it"" I've read in years. A slow start, but then it really takes off!"
"A page turner, from beginning to end. Hawkins' character development is mature and patient, so much so that I wanted to put the book down in frustration. Good authors know that interesting characters have complex, ""real"" lives, and we ride Rachel's emotional journey with her, never knowing until the end what her fate will be. This book left me wanting to hear more from this writer."
"Powerfully written, drawing you in to the deficits of an alcoholic's memory. How manipulated, humiliated, and controlled that memory can be. The struggle for truth is compelling. The characters are complex and interesting on many levels.I'm a tough sell, and I couldn't put it down!Because the characters are so well-drawn, my only criticism would be that there was no denouement for those who were suspected, but not found out.  Perhaps this is a plus?"
"This book is as addicting as advertised, but I found almost every character unappealing. The prose is simple, if uninspiring. The two books I'd compare it to are Gone Girl (which is more clever) and Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter (which has more spectacular writing).  For all that, I had to deduct one star - but again, it _is_ an addicting read; I finished it inside 24 hours...."
"A pager turner from the beginning.  I thought the author did an excellent job developing the characters.  I actually thought that the characters were more intriguing than the plot.  I was a little disappointed with the ending... it was not all unexpected, and the final confrontation was a little extreme.  However, even with that said, I thought it was an excellent read and highly recommend the book."
"I didn't read this book for the longest time because of the comparisons to ""Gone Girl"" which I hated.  I finally gave in and read it this past week, it is a great read, suspenseful, and really until the end I wasn't sure who ""done it.""  I would recommend this book, it is great thriller,"
"Not the usual genre I read but I enjoyed this book! The story kept me very engaged and I  cared ""who done it""!  Several scenarios were plausible! The concept was original. The narrative alternated between three of the main characters and the things were tied up at the end.  The writing style was perfect for the story.  Some characters were  better developed than others and  some plot details were a little shaky but overall, this was a fun read."
An entertaining novel that is only disturbed by the jumping around of dates from chapter to chapter.  Had to keep a note beside me to remember which person and when something was occurring.  The story is well written though the grand finale was less than a surprise.  I would suggest it to other friends.
Missed character development. The main character illustrated everything she felt and I didn't have a chance to interpret much. Trite.
I felt the story started out slowly and built to a creshendo.  Very good mystery that kept me guessing for awhile who was the murderer.  I felt the author vividly described the main female characters very well.  I felt the pain of the their misery and self deprivation.  Good writing from this author.
"I didn't like this book.  The story is so sad, about a divorced woman's life, and what her memories and a chance view of her former neighborhood did to cause what ensued.  The relationships described are unpleasant and unlikely, unless all those soap operas are true after all.  Some of the characters are well-defined and interesting."
"No one escapes suspicion in this tale of romance, jealousy, deceit, murder and revenge. In  Paula Hawkins' hand the pen is a lethal weapon as  shespares none of her characters sufficient weakness and motive to betray, seduce and murder not once but twice and then...each time the Girlon the Train arrives the story shifts... the mystery deepens. Not a book one puts away easily! Not a villain so quickly exposed.  Excellent piece of writing!"
"Very entertaining mystery of love, murder and intrigue, wrought by manipulation and emotional and ultimately physical abuse. All is not what it seems on the surface and the onion is peeled back slowly to reveal the truth. The author does an excellent job of slowly meeting out the details to keep you (well, at least me) guessing for a fairly long time throughout the story. I highly recommend this as an excellent read."
"I found this read particularly refreshing. I most enjoyed the varying perspectives from which the story is told. I'd recommend this to anyone interested in a romantic, suspenseful drama. It took me a while to finish the book, but it was very easy to pick up where I left off each time. Overall, the book was awesome and written appropriately for the storyline."
Characters made you hope that people weren't this ridiculous in real life. Unrealistic decision making in some aspects. Weak women
"I didn't guess the ending other than I knew the author was taking me a whole riddle of possibilities - which kept me gripped until the last page. There's a lot to discuss in this book in a bookclub; on how we see ourselves, how and why we feel shame and how we let others decide our identities for us. I loved it!"
"I began reading with a bias toward not liking it because I'm a sucker for negative reviews, but I ended up really liking this book. It had a sublime redemptive quality, and I did not find it at all predictable. I also disagree with the simplistic ""unreliable narrator"" take. I'd say more, but enough's been said already. Just don't dismiss this book because of the negative reviews. I almost did and am very glad I didn't."
"I loved this book. A lot of people compare it to Gone Girl, and having read some of it, I think that comparison is off. I enjoyed the writing, the story, and the characters within the novel. For the first 15-20 pages, I had a hard time getting into it, but once I got started I couldn't stop. And I enjoyed the fact that I didn't know who killed the girl in the story until everyone else in the book did. I highly recommend this."
So glad I got a chance to read this. I was hooked in the first 3 paragraphs. I can actually say I did not see the end coming until the book was nearly done.
"A chaotic who-dun-it that still manages to be predictable. Kudos to the narrative writing style Of Paula Hawkins, which is pacey, blurry aND captivating at times. The book is a litle contrived by using unreliable point of narration in a rather obvious way. It is nevertheless worth the read"
"I had no idea what to expect from this book.  Stephen King loved it, and it had fantastic reviews on Amazon, but I knew nothing of the storyline.  I'm glad I didn't, because I may not have decided to read it, and would have missed out.  Well written, telling the tale from three different perspectives:  the titular girl on the train, the mistress/new wife, and the nanny...sort of.  While I resolved the crime and mystery long before the main character, it didn't detract from the narrative, nor the suspense of the climax.  I'm lucky to have found the book as a deal through bookbub, and would definitely recommend it to others."
"I may in the minority but I enjoyed this kindle version of the book for 75 percent , however I found the last 25 percent a bit too dragged out and a bit too unremarkable. I actually had a hard time finishing the book. This is just my humble opion of course."
"I should know better. After the big let down of the second half of 'Gone Girl', reading a book promoted as the next GG would always be a risk.Not one likeable character.I guessed whodunnit 1/3 of the way through.Look, the last 35% of the story, it got going and got me in, so that's 4.5 stars, minus one for me being able to guess, minus half a star for a novel with no redeemable characters."
"Good read and a mystery to be solved, though it does start to become apparent who did it...my issue was there was not a single likeable or sympathetic character;  pretty typical of the current ""literary"" fiction. Every one of the women is weak and deluded and the men are worse."
LOVE this book. Cannot wait for the movie. I read this novel when Gone Girl was popular.  I felt that The Girl on the Train had much better character development.  When reading the two novels within weeks of the other I really enjoyed The Girl on the Train much more.  Gone Girl was a disappointment in comparison.
"Some good points but also not so good issues.  This is a takeoff of ""Gone Girl"" but was difficult to follow in the beginning.  My big complain was that this mystery was full of holes that made it so unrealistic at times that I became frustrated.It was a page turner only because it was difficult to follow and only if one turns the page to the next chapter will they understand the last chapter.I like Paula Hawkins but she has to improve on the little issues that are unbelievable and I cannot say I did not enjoy certain aspects of this book."
"I know this was made into a movie and everyone seems to like it, but I was disappointed in the main character. I felt she was a very weak person and this is why I did not like the book. Besides the main character, the story is interesting and has twists and turns throughout the book."
"Wow!! What a incredible book!! I absolutely loved it right from the start! A great mystery that kept me on the edge of my seat till the very end. Paula Hawkins really knows how to write to keep you guessing. I loved the different POV while telling the story. The characters were compelling, and I found that I couldn't put it down until I finished it.A must read!! Highly recommended!"
"I read this in two days. Simply couldn't put it down! Very well written from the first page. Rachel was an engrossing character. Damaged and broken and because of her unreliability in what was real or unreal, due to her drinking, she was the perfect character for this plot. This novel was so well written and took this reader along for an enjoyable ride with all the twists and turns.  The writing wasn't overly descriptive but certainly enough that I felt like ""I"" was sitting on that train right next to Rachel.Personally, I thought it was way better than Gone Girl........I loved Gone Girl ALL the way through until the ending when I shook my head and said, what?! Not so with this story. Realistic and satisfying ending that doesn't leave the reader shaking their head in confusion. My only concern is now finding another book to keep me as engrossed as this one did. I highly recommend it!"
"This is a different tack on storytelling.  The author jumps from character to character with them speaking in the first person.  It is very well done in how the peculiarities of each character are perceived by the other characters, and what appears to be accurate and true, may not be so.  The author keeps the reader involved from the beginning to the end."
"This is an amazing debut novel.  I was disappointed only that this WAS a debut novel, because I wanted to read other books by this author.  It is a suspenseful page-turner in the same vein as Gone Girl.  The author's style of writing is captivating.  I've started and stopped several novels lately due to so much extraneous fluff.  I was finding myself wishing this book was longer.  Keeps you guessing till the end.  I definitely recommend."
"I gave this book three stars due to the snail pace beginning. Towards the last 50 pages is when I couldn't put it down. I wish it was a true thriller the entire read but truthfully Paula; it's not. A New York Times best seller(not really) but hopefully, if there are women reading this that are living this life......please listen to your ""Rachel""."
"Ms. Hawkins has been able to go deep within the labyrinths of her characters to expose what happens when the destruction of romantic connections spiral into and uncover the very dark compulsions that are carefully kept away from view in so-called and apparent ""normal"" relationships.  This is such a well-crafted novel that trying to compare it to ""Gone Girl"" is a mistake that will only detract from the joy of reading an extraordinary work by this author."
"The main character of the story was drunk during much of the narration. She spent most of the book trying to remember what happened during a blackout. She wasn't very endearing, nor were the other characters who played a role in the story telling. There were some good twists and some anticipation at the end, so that part wasn't bad. Just not a favorite overall."
Loved loved loved this book.
"Far exceeds any and all expectations from beginning to end. Never wanted to reach the last page wanting it to go on, but all was resolved in an excellent fashion!"
"I struggled to maintain interest in this book. It picked up towards the end very rapidly. So you have to stick with it. Now I'm not a big fan of this kind of plot. I think a book needs to keep you interested throughout. I didn't get that here. But it was pretty well written and interesting. I'm not going to recommend this one. But I'm pretty picky so you decide for yourself. You will like the ending though, I pretty much guarantee that."
"Depressing....Too many characters....Way too much detailed descriptions of things.....constant drinking and rough sex...and mentioning it almost on every page....title is a ""grabber type"" which makes one think there's more to it....believe me...there isn't.  I would never recommend this book to anyone and almost hesitate to donate it to the local library."
"It's the same thing over and over and over! ""I miss my ex-husband."" ""I'm an alcoholic."" ""I can't remember."" I was so disappointed."
"This is a great psychological thriller. I loved it!  It take place in England and is told through the voices of of the female characters. The author did a wonderful job of describing the environment, especially the views from the train told by one of the female characters which is central to the story. You also could see the personalities of the characters through their thought processes. I highly recommend this book. It's an easy read and grips you from the very beginning."
"Honestly, I just bought this book to read it again because I borrowed it from a friend a while back, and I was so excited to dig in, which I did. I had seen all the hype surrounding it. But, honestly, I don't get the hype...at least not the first time around. I'm hoping I'll enjoy it more this time...I'm all about second chances. But, the characters aren't as developed as I wanted them to be and were predictable. It was a good book, just not as good as the hype suggests. But, here goes round two. I hope I find what I missed the first time."
"I didn't guess the ending other than I knew the author was taking me a whole riddle of possibilities - which kept me gripped until the last page. There's a lot to discuss in this book in a bookclub; on how we see ourselves, how and why we feel shame and how we let others decide our identities for us. I loved it!"
"It took me forever to read this very boring book.  I didn't  like Rachel and found her very depressing,  i read a lot but this was not a good story. I have never felt this way about another book.  Im suprise so many people recommend  The Girl On The Train.  I know i won't. One"
"A great read. It starts slowly and I had to pick up the book three times before I got through the first 50 pages. After the 50 page barrier, I was hooked and didn't stop reading until the very end. The ending is good, but not quite up to the riveting story that starts after the first fifty pages. Definitely a good vacation book. Can't wait until author's next book."
"So glad these women didn't continue as pathetic victims. The unfolding of truth was well done. Anna was triumphant mad creepy at same time. She might be the character I would most likely to see if cashed in movie. Megan was so well scripted out... Sounded borderline personality or bipolar. Well done. The doctor ... Story of her past had so much potential for a thriller in itself. Great characters ... Lushes, cheats, narcissists. I didn't feel sorry for people too long which was a nice reprieve. Everyone was good and evil; except baby. Not sure if murderer was anything but a pathological liar gone socio path. Not a lot of good underneath it all. Liked it very much. Will miss no one though. Never want to see anyone again because it would be a nightmare that you would want to wake up from. Scary women.  Scary men. Evie has a legacy now."
"I could not put it down.  Some of the timing/person switching got a bit confusing,, but I was reading quickly to see what happens! Nice amount of twisting.  Good character development on the protagonist.  Some more development on the men might make the book even better, but no complaints!"
"Love the story behind the author. Good for her!There are dates throughout the book, each chapter that I kinda ignored.  The female voices aren't that dissimilar. They become more so unique, but initially are quite similar.Might see the movie in the theater, or wait for steaming."
It's hard to like such a flawed main character and took me a while to get into it. But the twists are great and I thought I was almost finished about halfway - and from that point on I couldn't put it down.
"I bought this book mostly because it was compared to Gillian Flynn's 'Gone Girl'; totally wrong!  The comparison could not be more inaccurate.  If the goal of the author was to write a book on characters that the reader was unable to relate to, or create a tangle pathetic characters, then the goal was accomplished.The story was good, but the characters were so unlikable.  Rachel the alcoholic who just had to be a part of the investigation into Megan's disappearance that she lies to Megan's husband Scott about knowing Megan. Rachel's ex-husband Tom the manipulator along with Anna his new wife the neurotic, lives in the house Rachel lived in with Tom when they were married.  Megan, trying to forget a traumatic experience, sleeps around on her docile, colorless husband Scott. At one point in the book, I was hoping Rachel character would have been the one to die off, in one of her drunken stupors; her character was just too contemptible.I'm not saying don't read the book, I just could not justify the comparison with any of the characters from 'Gone Girl.'"
"the thing is, it is more about how jealous and an alcoholic the main character was than actually the story. You will read about how she HATES her ex's wife and how disgusting the character was than know about what's the story really is.For me, it was TOO dark, I highly don't recommend this :( watch the movie instead when it comes out, it will probably be bad too."
"the pretense of this book being much like 'gone girl' and set against the backdrop of trains immediately caught my interest. Some parts of the story are perhaps a little far fetched and some may say predictable, but this book did not disappoint me. I felt Rachel was relatable with her poor choices and forgotten memories from excessive drinking, many of us readers have been there in the dark chapters of our lives. I will  definitely keep up with any other books by this author."
"I am not sure what to think about this book. It is easy to read and well written, but the plot makes only limited sense. 3 stars as it was neither bad not really good."
"I felt this book and story line were tedious.  I became very bored and aggravated with the constant description of the main character's alcoholism.  I realize it was integral to the plot, but it became a character in the storyline.  If a person can wade through the first three quarters of the book, the last quarter is excellent."
"LOVED IT!!!!! This book kept you guessing from the beginning on what was going on!! I read through it quickly and was annoyed when I had to put it down.  It is now becoming a movie and I look very forward to seeing the movie adaptation, which I am sure will not be able to come close to the book!  MUST READ!!"
"Want to read a book where everyone sucks? Do you want to be in a bad mood just thinking about it? Then by all means, read this awful book!"
"From beginning to end, this book engages the reader whereby the reader won't put it down. I loved the story line and how it was presented. A MUST read..."
"Even though I solved the mystery about 2/3 the way through, it was still interesting to see the plot play out.  The characters were well defined, and the suspense well planned.  Easy, quick read. Enjoyed the storyline.  Little cursing; generalized sexual content - not too graphic.  Would recommend. Yes, I gave this book four stars - not necessarily for the prose, but for the well conceived story line and fleshed out characters."
"Had potential to be great story, but the constant time jumps plus the fact the first two thirds of this book was just the same thing over and over it was really hard to care.It was seriously the hangover just spread over three days and not nearly as entertainingWould've been better as a novella"
"I probably could have read this book in one sitting if I didn't have other commitments! I was drawn from the first chapter. The writing style was easy to read, and it flowed nicely. I haven't had much of a chance to read a lot of fiction in recent years, but I'm sure glad I made the time to read this. It was great!"
"If you (like me) are someone who always prefers the book to the movie, buy and read this book now, as it will inevitably be made into a film! From page one, I was drawn into this novel. The suspense builds quickly, and is sustained throughout the entire book. My book club LOVED this selection, and can't wait to read more by this author."
"I liked the story over all - the person who dunnit was not obvious from the first and there were interesting co p,ications. BUT, I found her internal struggles repetitious and tedious. I ended up skipping througj most of her emotional ramblings since they all pretty much said the same thing."
"I enjoyed this book.  The story of the Girl On The Train and of Meh, the missing person are told in the voices of three  female characters, Rachel, the Girl on the trainers is attempting to get over the break up of her marriage to Tom and is slowly sinking into an alcoholic bottom, Anna, Tom's second wife and Meh, who is missing. This is an interesting story telling tecjnique"
I really enjoyed the suspense of this book and the narration. It kept it very interesting to read the different sides of the stories
I enjoyed this book. The short prose of each character kept it flowing smoothly and kept me intrigued. Good read.
So this book is actually really contagious.  It may be a slow read at the beginnig (for us that are pickey readers) but once it starts you're on the edge. You have to get to the end but then you may be afraid of not wanting the story to end. But this was a  really enjoyable read.
"Everyone told me to stick with it, so I did.  But there aren't any characters with any redeeming qualities.  The men are all horrible people and the women are all dysfunctional or dead.  Not my idea of a good time, personally, but everyone else seems to love it!"
"Gritty, dark and absolutely gripping. I was pretty much caught from the start. I suspected everyone so it was very well crafted and still couldn't confidently say who it was until it was revealed. There wasn't one really likeable character but it was the point and it made you suspect everyone. I felt sympathy for many and the author wrote in such a way that you could see why and how they became so unlikeable, pathetic and pitiful. written and intense!"
Good book.
Loved the book copy and I would love to see the movie to this wonderful book that keyed me on the edge of my seat.
"For the longest time I haven't been able to find a good read. I took a chance on this one and it is amazing! Fantastically crafted this author provides such great insight into the minds of so many different characters! Also there were so many twists and turns with no slow moving parts at all! I would recommend this book to any lover of Lifetime films because it is crafted like one that would be in theaters. Overall LOVE, LOVE, LOVED IT!"
"Great read - kept me on the edge from start to finish. So hard to put down and the story plot was well told, believable, fast paced and yet the twists and turns keep you guessing.  Hawkins writing is very personable so she keeps the reader engaged from start to finish - no dull points here."
"Such a good, fast read! I was drawn in from the beginning. When I'm riding the train into the city, I look out at all the houses we pass and I have wondered about those who live in them. To have a story start out with a train ride with imaginings of the inhabitants of those houses was genius. And with a bonus of an extremely well-written story, it became immediately a ""I can't put this down"" book. I hope to see more from this author!"
"It has been some time since I have felt such an urgent need to reach the end of a book...and this after having seen the interview on CBS This morning.  I immediately ordered it on my Kindle, began reading at 9:30 a.m. and after brunch break and dinner break was finished by 7:00 p.m. that night.  It definitely qualifies as a part-time once becomes accustomed to the format.  It is in the same genre as GONE GIRL, although I wasn't as eager to reach the end of that one as"
"An absolute page turner ...could not put it down. This is not normally a genre I would choose, but my book club picked it as our current book. A brilliant first novel with complex and interesting characters, and a multi layered storyline. Anyone of the main characters has motive and you are kept guessing almost until the end.....quite a twist, and totally unexpected. I read the book a week ago, and cannot stop recommending it to whoever will listen! Loved it."
"Outstanding! A very human storyline that brings virtues and vices crossing each other all the time. The characters are very well built and the timing is perfect. I had to fallow 3 different and parallel narratives that go interweaving with each other, the whole plot carries lots of drama and suspense laden situations that end up in a surprising upshot. An excellent book!"
Couldn't put it down. Was held in suspense until the end. Very well written using several different voices throughout. It exposes the good and evil that exists within people. Highly recommend.
"I can't for the life of me figure out why everyone is excited about this book. I'm 3/4 of the way through, and bored to tears. The characters are not interesting, likeable, or believable. Unless they did some major rewriting of the plot, the movie will be a snooze fest too. Don't waste your money."
"I've read a lot of books in my time, but ""The Girl On The Train"" is hands down the best book I have ever read! If you like Agatha Christie or anything remotely close to a mystery or murder mystery approved of by Alfred Hitchcock himself, then you will love this book. Don't miss your chance to read ""The Girl On The Train""."
"This is one of those books that you have to read fast because you're hoping the end is better than the rest of the book.There are no poetic sentences, no great descriptions, no interesting characters, no sublime dialogue, just a horrible paranoid feeling of sadness, vindictiveness, and dread from the three women who inhabit the book.Somehow, they miraculously changed their demeanor at the end and became heroines."
"This book was not as good as I had been led to believe that it would be. It's narrated by three different people and at first, it's hard to understand who they are and who's talking about what. It was very confusing until the characters were all straightened out. The names of the narrators should be in a darker font, as well, because it is easy to miss the names on the Kindle as you are reading."
"After all the hype that I had been reading about this book,  I honestly expected to be more interested in finding out for myself what it was all about. I have it be honest. In my opinion it was simply boring. I found it very difficult to even become interested in it from the very beginning. Maybe it's just me, but the twists & turns of it all weren't exactly earth shattering. Quite predictable actually."
"The ending of this book was something else! It was interesting to see how the characters in the book intertwined as the story progressed. Some people might feel the beginning is slow but the readers need to get to know the characters, and the challenges they face in their lives."
"This tale delves into the lives of Rachel and people close to her. She is at the center of a murder, which she insisted on being a part of. Her character is in even, wholly unlikable at times other times somewhat sympathetic and thus weakens the overall story. Neither villain nor hero, Rachel's problematic story drives the narrative with speed, stops and slow points similar to the train she rides daily. Good, but not great."
"Number two on the best seller's list, so naturally I had to read it.  I hate stories that jump back in forth in time trying to keep up with what day it is and who is talking.  The storyline was good; just not told very well.  All the characters in the book are morons, no one to actually like or care about what happens to them.  As like others, I had to keep reading just to see who did what, and I had it picked out from the beginning."
"I really wanted to love this book. I've read so many accolades about why Girl on the Train is your next favorite book if you liked Gone Girl, and I think my expectations were too high. It was good - not fantastic. It was missing the gripping quality that other psychological thrillers embody beautifully. Still - good weekend read. Just don't go into it hoping to be blown away."
"I found it confusing the first third of the story. I couldn't figure out how each character related to the other. However, the ending was a surprise!"
"LOVED the book and as usual it is better than the movie. I loved the audio, was nice to sew while listening to the book..sometimes lay in bed and listening to end of falling asleep and wake up 10+ pages later! Don'5 get me wrong, but like a kid being read too you end up falling asleep!"
"Overall, I really liked this book and understand all of its praise. I did, however, find myself slogging through the middle where it seemed to get repetitive. It was easy to get into the characters and the story and for the first 1/3 I was riveted. I got through a few slow parts and then felt that it all came together well in the end. Nice writing and a great story."
"The overall story line was interesting and I liked that it was told from multiple perspectives, however, it was a bit too predictable to me to really be a psychological thriller."
"Honestly I LOVED THIS BOOK! It started off really slow, and i even had some friends tell me that they could not get through the beginning. But i loved it ! You just have to keep reading and eventually you are hooked. I would recommend this book to anyone who needs a good read. You will never see whats coming at the end."
"I definitely would recommend this novel, it's a great read. However, I do have to admit that there were times where I felt annoyed with the repetitive nature of the storyline. Ultimately though, the story came together beautifully. My mouth is still agape."
"This book took over 100 pages to finally get me interested.  Do note, that I am reader who will always read to the end even if I don't like the book.  I liked the story just not the writing!!  Too much back and forth with the people and the dates.  I would not read another book by this Arthur."
"I don't read a lot of fiction, but this book (which was advertised on my Kindle) intrigued me.  Having read a couple of reviews, I also noticed that my close friend read the book from a library.  My one complaint is that it is at times become hard to follow.  It is written from the viewpoint of two - then three - women.  At first, it is not clear who you are reading about.  However, this does eventually become quite clear.  The author weaves a fascinating story.  I would compare it to my favorite fiction author, Tami Hoag.  While Ms. Hawkins' book is not quite up to Ms. Hoag's stories, it is still very good.  I do look forward to reading more of Ms. Hawkins' books.  And, I'm sure that this novel will make a great movie."
"The book is a good, fast read. It doesn't quite live up to the hype--while well written, when all is said and done there is nothing particularly unique about it--but is still worth checking out.The characters are interesting although you could argue not a single one is likable. The killer is also fairy predictable, though how things will unfold isn't quite so much."
"For those who like Gillian Flynn, I highly recommend this book. For those looking for redeemable characters, sympathetic even in the slightest vein, and for complete, grammatically correct sentences, this book is not for you. For those accustomed to complex characters, complex dialogue and mellifluous language, do not even think about picking this one up. I think this book started out in a melancholy way, sunk to depression and by the end, even with the fun twist, the book found its way to a place even lower than depression. I think, though, this would make a good thriller movie."
My daughter read this book and kept telling me to read it. I finally did read the book. Great book with lots of twists and turns. I always felt anxious while reading because I never could figure out what Rachel was going to do next.  Now I need to go see the movie. Happy Reading!
"The story unravels slowly, as each woman tells part of the mystery.  Secrets are revealed, with the biggest secret saved until the end.  Upon finishing, I wanted to read it again to see how the author did it....kept me guessing all the way through.  A good, fast page turner!"
"This was a very good book. It had a steady pace then slowed a bit as the author tried to describe more of the main character's thoughts and feelings, but then it picked up and became more suspenseful. Overall, the story was good with many twists."
"I thought the book was well written. It certainly held my attention. I usually don't read thrillers, but it was recommended by some of my collegues The story had some interesting twists and turns.  The main characters were well developed and complex.  I was both sympathetic to Rachel and frustated by her dysfunctional behavior centering around her alcoholism. All of the main chacters had a distorted view of the world and their relationships.  In the end some are vindicated but in a not quite so satisfying way.  Their vindication sadly reflected their neurotic and near psychotic states of mind. I would recommend this book to readers who like psycho thrillers."
"This book is an excellent, impossible-to-put-down read. The story line is compelling, the main character frustrating yet relatable, and throughout it all an intense mystery that keeps the reader on their toes. It is definitely meant for adults, but I highly recommend it!"
"Every book today is compared to Gone Girl. Its the New Gone Girl,the Newer Gone Girl,  the Newest Gone Girl. So for those of you expecting a Gone Girl Repeat, this book will disappoint you.  I for one did not love Gone Girl.  However, as The Girl on the Train has amassed 10,000 plus reviews on Amazon, it has just as much hype as Gone Girl.  Train's premise is fun especially for those of us who enjoy peering in people's houses  and lives unobserved from the window of a train or car but  the execution is amateur. Still it is a compelling read.  Rachel is a fun character, a total loser who has kind of accepted her rejected, drunken status and doesn't seem to get to rattled about anything.  Won't take too much figuring out to guess who the killer is in this book but all the same, its a pleasant way to pass a few hours."
"This novel focuses on three female characters. One is the ex-wife, one is the current wife and one is the mistress. Each character is developed using morning and evening time, and the main character rides the train every day. The ""heroine"" is an alcoholic sad sack, but the author manages to make her sympathetic. It's an English novel that translates well to an American audience. I can't wait for the movie. Buy this book now!"
The book was good but I found myself not liking the characters. The character development was good but the 3 main characters are women that I found to not be admirable in my opinion and made it a bit hard for me to get through the middle of the book where the story is starting to develop.
"Maybe I missed something, but I did not find this the wonder that everyone else in the world seems to think it is.I was tired of reading about the drinking and the blackouts, and the speculation, and the droning on, that I really didn't even care about the ending.Although many people recommend this book, I just can't."
I read this book thinking that it was going to be another hyped up piece of garbage. Boy was I wrong. This was one of the best books I have read in a long time. Paula Hawkins has earned her stripes and belongs up there with the greats. I love suspense and this book knocks you over with it.
"I found this book tedious in the extreme.  Not fast-paced, not a thriller.  The characters weren't relatable, they were boring.  The alcoholism was grating, and far too repetitively convenient as a plot point.  I'm giving it two stars because the writing was decent -- not compelling, but Ms. Hawkins knows how to put sentences together and has a decent command of grammar, a skill not shared by a lot of current authors.  Her plotting is another matter. The overall plot wasn't bad, but along the lines of what another reviewer wrote, instead of putting the effort required into writing a truly engaging story with unfolding events, the author just had her narrators withhold detail so she could have a series of plot twists.  I knew who the killer was halfway through the book.  The final twist was the most satisfying, but it was an effort to finish the book to get to it."
"The girl on the train is a book that will keep you on your toes the entire time!! The mystery and suspense in this novel is outstanding, never have I read a book as shocking as this! It will keep you guessing until the very end, and keep your mind in awe."
"I am not fond of the writing style of flipping back and forth in time and having different chapters featuring different characters coming and going. I guess if you sit down and read the book in one night you can keep track but I ended up having to make a list of dates and characters since the story goes back and forth from one year to another - along with different characters coming and going.  Confusing to follow. That said, the plot is clever albeit I think confusing to follow. As the characters evolved I found the changes somewhat hard to believe.  For instance Rachel is an alcoholic, depressed, nonfunctional person but at the end she rises to become the heroine. this book was a selection for a book club I am in.  We haven't met to discuss it but I know one member couldn't put the book down."
"One of the best ways to build suspense and keep the reader wondering who the killer might be is through the device of the unreliable narrator. This book capitalizes on major characters who have seriously traumatic backgrounds and who are narrating their mistaken version of what is happening while trying to break through their foggy delusions. Somehow these narrators are sympathetic, too."
"I felt as if I was on the train hidden away to watch Rachel as she went about her days As I got deeper into the book,I already knew that Megan was having an affair with Rachel's ex-husband Tom before I came upon.That funny feeling that some people get when they know something before it's introduced to them.I read it in my free time and left it on dresser for days until I could read more,towards the end I figured that at least one or two of the characters would end up dead.Was not too surprised to read that in the end Tom got exactly what he deserved. It was good book to read and as usual I couldn't put it down at night while reading until 3:00 am came and I needed some sleep."
"Although this tends to be a bit confusing at the beginning since the time-line is disjoint, the ultimate resolution, and the journey to get there makes this such a good read.  You ultimately care for all the characters except the one you are supposed to despise."
"I read this book based on the favorable reviews.(and because at the airport I saw 5 other people reading it).  I was not disappointed. Have to admit, it was pretty creepy.... thank heavens I don't live on a railway line, I would have to move or cover my windows. I like the way she told the story from several different views of characters. I did have a little trouble keeping up with the dates but in the end the story weaves together nicely. All along you could feel that something was not quite as it should be, because she leads the reader along very nicely. I won't go into the story line, it has been told by other reviewers. Good Read, would highly recommend."
"The book was enjoyable although I found the majority of the individuals in it to be very shallow.  Admittedly, the protagonist had her share of problems but in the long run, Rachel, her roommate and the therapist turned out to be the most decent of the lot."
"I wasn't expecting much when I picked this book up to read. I just wanted to read it before the movie was released. Now I'm hoping, but not expecting, the movie to be as good as the book. The twists and turns are definitely worth wading through some fairly depressing storyline. Well done."
"The Girl on The Train started out slowly, but once I got into it, I wanted to know what was going to happen next (or what she might remember next!).  It is written a lot like a movie - I am sure it will be a movie one day.  It is funny, I don't usually like books unless I like or can relate to the characters.  I did not like any of the characters - AT ALL!  It was a little bit like Gone Girl in that sense.  I did have sympathy for them at different times, but usually just wanted to shake them and tell them to get it together.  It is a great summer read - not too much depth of character and a few we were left hanging with (""what happened to him?!?"") - but very entertaining."
"I bought this book to read because the movie trailer look intriguing. I could not put it down!  Every time I thought I had it figured out, there was a twist I didn't see coming. Very quick read or just seemed that way because you can't stop reading...every ""chapter"" is the good part!"
"Had a little bit of a hard time following it till I watched the trailior on internet before the movie came out.  However I am looking forward to seeing the movie. Putting faces to the people in the book helped, was able to follow easier. Want to see the movie soon."
"I rarely buy unknown authors but the title and brief description intrigued me.  It was a good gamble, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The writing style was easy but not relaxed, it kept up the pace.  The plot although a bit convoluted was relatively convincing and the ends all tied together in a believable manner.  In fact I believe a lot of the clues were embedded in the story but not being familiar with the author's style I missed a fair few.  For a first time (?) novel it was an impressive achievement and I'm sure will they will Theget better and better with experience.  Well done Paula."
"I started this book and stopped after the first few chapters because I was bored.  However, saw the movie trailer and was determined to finish the book before I saw the movie (which looked really good).  The book got better the second time the more I got into it so I'm glad I gave it a second chance."
I gave the story a five star rating because it is one of the best stories I have ever read. I loved the mystery about it and the suspense. She started telling the story and it left you wanting way more . EVERYTHING falls into place at the end. I promise it will keep you wanting more.
"This book kept my attention.  At first, I had trouble getting into it, but once I put a few pieces together in terms of the characters' relationships to each other and their multi-faceted issues, I was drawn in.  The characters are not necessarily likable, but they are believable while exasperating.  It's a compelling read, although not exactly uplifting."
"This is a good book. The story was interesting, it kept my attention, and I was pretty surprised by the ending. But, with that being said, I did not care for the main character at all. She was very unlikable and didn't seem to really have any kind of redeeming qualities to her. I was much more interested in the side characters and what was going on with them. I would like to read more from the author, but I am hoping for a much more likable main character."
"A fast-paced novel, fun to read as you try to elucidate the mystery along with the main character. The author weaves together in her novel such contemporary issues as loneliness, alcoholism, adultery, and somehow manages to create a story line that is engaging and keeps you reading way into the night."
"This was a good novel, although I didn't get to finish the book before I saw the movie, I still say the book is always better, it just puts a face and a voice to the characters. It didn't grab my attention  (the book) like I expected it to. Over all its a food book, not a page Turner though."
"This book is very hard for me to rate, or review. It took me a while to get into the story, but once I did, I read it quickly.  The characters are not inherently likable, but that did make them more interesting and real.Like most novels in this genre, the end felt rushed and a little obvious. Before I finished the book, I would have given it a 5. By the end, it was more like a 3.  I guess I'll settle on a 4..."
"A good book to read, however it does get somewhat monotonous riding the train page after page.  The author changes the personalities of the main characters from normal to disgusting.  Only one character seemed real to me.I did like the idea of the different first person narratives."
"Addictive behaviors,dysfunctional characters, lies, substance abuse.  Seems like this book has it all.  The plot thickens with every chapter. This is definitely not light hearted reading.  The ending was a bit of a surprise, and although I would say that this was not an enjoyable read, I found myself caught up into the character's lives and anxious to find out how it would all end."
"Paula Hawkings ""The Girl on the Train"" is a great entry into the mystery genre.  The structure of the story is inventive.  At first I didn't know how I would like the 2 x per day narrative, but it really works, especially when different characters enter the picture.  The back and forth timeline adds tension, and the Hawkings is able to keep up the suspense most of the way through the book.  I'll definitely read her next novel."
"Interesting plot, but After awhile I found myself one step ahead of each character none of whom I cared about. I thought there could at least be one ""normal"" character to be sympathetic for. Too much drunkeness, unfaithfulness, violence, and psychosis for me. Reading it on the kindle, I had to keep looking back to see which character I was reading about. Parts of it really dragged. 3 stars for the plot."
I couldn't put this book down. There are so many twists and turns. You think you have it all figured out and it makes a sudden turn. Then you are convinced you know what has happened and it turns again. It is like being on an exciting roller coaster. One of the best books I've read in a very long time.
"First, I should say that I prefer nonfiction and was curious about this book because I like trains!The author describes the scenes well--I could see this made into a thriller movie.However, for me a lot of it seemed too far fetched and dumb. At the end, I was so ready to get back to something real, like a good memoir--or even a historical novel! So I gave it 3 stars for its vividness of scenes and the character descriptions (but not their actions)."
"Terrible story.  Terrible characters.  Terrible plotting.  Not sure what all the hoopla is.  By the end, the reader is so turned off by all the characters, he/she could really give a crap who dies or lives or who the culprit is.  I fell for the hype and was gravely disappointed.  Felt like I was The Boy on the Trainwreck."
This is a fantastic read - I highly recommend it to anyone that might enjoy a detective/murder/suspense novel.  It is a complicated plot - I had to keep going back a few pages each time I put it down to renew who each of the characters were until I got them all placed in my head.  And you'll change your mind as to who the killer is every time you pick it up to read -  get it - read it - you'll be glad you did
"I cringed throughout so much of this novel because Hawkins writes in such a way that she reveals all of our deepest shames, our bad experiences, raw human thoughts. It is also why I couldn't put this book down. Give this a read! And definitely do it before you watch the movie"
"Written from perspective of three women of seemingly different natures.  Slow pace picks up towards the end for your climax and surprise.Made it 4 stars at that point but due to the slow ""train speed"" up front,  certainly 3 star better than 2 1/2 posted.  Was well written and at times leaned towards the four star category.... keep us chugging along Paula...hoping to see more of your books."
"Best book I've read in a long time. Very easy reading, a great mystery, and I couldn't put it down. Everything you want in a book!"
"This thriller was a real page turner.  At first I had a little difficulty with the author changing the chapters with different women speaking, but realized this only enhanced the mystery behind who was the real killer.  The narrative also gave insight into problems associated with addiction, self esteem and paranoia.  I hope to read more by this author.  This novel would make a great motion picture film."
"I must admit I was somewhat confused in the first quarter of the book, I had to get familiar with the writing style and the 3 part POV, but after the first third of the book I was hooked. I had to know what would happen, and I enjoyed the many different POV's, and I was on the edge of my seat contemplating my own outcomes. All in all the book kept me entertained and if you love a good murder mystery mixed up in some trainwreck like love stories you're in for a good read."
Meh.
"It was a little confusing at first. I wasn't aware that there were multiple Characters perspectives, but after I realized that it was month sailing! Let's just say it keeps you on your toes nearly the whole book and the ending....  Boy you don't see that coming!"
"This is a ""chapter"" book wherein different characters narrate different chapters. There could have been more character development for both female and male characters, in my opinion. The ending was definitely not anticipated. Rachel rides the same train every morning. To pass the time, she looks out the window, inventing stories about the people she sees every day. She even gives them names. One day, she sees one of the women kiss a man who is not her husband. Later, she finds out the woman is missing. One might need a notepad to keep track of who is who doing what . I only wish the characters had been more fully developed."
"It may be my fondness for tv reality shows like Intervention and true-crime murders on the ID channel, but I find this collection of characters quite believable.  Any two of them could very well relate in real life.  Here a novelist plays with the consequences when a bigger group of self-deluders and liars collides - but that's the fun of the novel.  The writing is first-rate.  You do have to pay attention to the chapter headings, telling you which character is speaking and - importantly - when.  Otherwise, it all goes on swimmingly.It does seem fair to warn potential readers: if you're delighted to find a new mystery involving a beautiful girl who inherits a cupcake shop, or an old mansion, or a dude ranch that has to be shared with a surly but handsome cowboy, this likely isn't the book for you."
"I thought this read was so good! I felt like I was right there in the story. It keeps you guessing and it awesome. I would recommend everyone read this! Plus the movie comes out in October, so hurry and read it before it comes out! The author did a great job, so good that they made a movie."
Once I got use to the different characters going back and forth I did really well.  It was a thrill and a great mystery.  It kept you in suspense until the end.  The kind of mystery that I love to curl up in my chair and get lost in.  Once I started I could not put it down.  My daughter was listening to it on tape at the same time.  I can not wait for the movie to come out!!
"What I liked about this book was that the narrators weren’t entirely reliable or likeable. One of my favorite lines comes from Rachel, who is battling alcoholism. She says, “How much better life must have been for jealous drunks before emails and texts and mobile phones, before all these electronics and traces it leaves.”The first person narrators don’t have distinctive voices, so if you put the book down in the middle of a chapter, it will take you a second to figure out who is talking (you can figure out if it’s Rachel if she’s talking about how much she wants a drink, for example.) All in all though, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will recommend it to friends because I couldn’t wait to come back to it to find out what happened, and I wasn’t disappointed."
"Just took too long to get to anything significant happening. These people are all so scummy that I skipped to the end after page 147. Tom and Anna are the biggest sleezebags from the beginning and its actually really unbelievable that people like this actually exist. If you've ever been dumped after being cheated on, this book will do nothing but infuriate. I'm actually mad at my friend who suggested this and I won't ever forgive her for it."
"A girlfriend of mine recommended this book for my most recent beach vacation so I went ahead and bought it on amazon, which is at a great price! Anyways, I couldn't put it down when I had the time on the cruise ship and couldn't figure out what was going to happen the entire time. I'm so glad I continued to read, not that I was ever able to put it down, but so many books I just don't finish because I become bored. Paula Hawkins wrote this book so nicely, allowing for the reader to be in the shoes of all of the characters in different times becoming so engrossed in the story. Great read, and if you figure out what's going to happen at the end you might want to go into CSI work!!"
"I think I enjoyed this book, but I'm just not sure exactly why. It was a little slow at first but then picked up speed and I finished it in two sittings. I really didn't like any of the characters and the ending was a little boring and somewhat predictable, but I gave it 4 stars because the story line was odd and it intrigued me."
I binge read this book and I don't regret the sleepless night. Every point of view and every chapter was so detailed it made me feel in it. Caught up in the drama. Just so simple and amazing I loved it. I recommend this to anyone who wants a thriller/twisted story.
"Seriously, what a mess! It's like being a rubber necker passing by a horrific auto accident... you know you should just walk away, but you keep looking because you have to know what happened.  Well, now that I know, I'm glad it's over, and I'm definitely not watching the movie."
"A good thriller... situations and scenes as seen through the eyes of the three women, who form the base of the plot is very interesting. And the collaboration of the past and present scene at the end is done nicely. A good thrilling and unexpected plot. Good plot with the suspense held tightly till the last."
"One of those overrated novels everyone reads. It is relentlessly dark. Every major character is morally empty: liars, cheaters, drunks. And, a killer. There's a surprise , of course. The plot twist is the reward for your slog through the novel, but you'll figure it out before the big reveal. So, even that seems hollow; formulaic.It's the kind of novel that makes you want to go to the liquor store, but not the nice one; the one in the sketchy neighborhood, by the railroad tracks. For cheap wine."
"Finished in about a day, very easy to read and the story quickly gains pace. I have to say I quite enjoyed the story, however I did guess the ending about halfway through. The only reason I'm knocking it half a star is because the dates were a little hard to follow and I had to keep flipping back to see what was taking place when."
"OK mystery, though, as a frequent mystery reader I figured some of it out before the big reveal.  I did get bored with all the first-person whining that went on among 3 different women, so I found myself skipping whole chunks of stream of consciousness writing to get to the action."
"The writing did keep me reading. Ultimately though, this turned into a predictable and rather dull story. Robert Gailbraith is 100 times over a better mystery/thriller author. I'm glad I read it however, for else I always would have wondered if I was missing out on something."
I'm glued!! I loved Gone Girl and even though the price for a kindle purchase seemed high I really wanted to read it. I only read about 2-3 books a year and I am loving this. The only thing I'm having a hard time with is the jumping around of dates. It goes through 2 girls stories and parts of certain days. Its not easy to flip around on a kindle and compare days.
"I thought it was a pretty decent book. It did, after all, hold my interest. There were some parts that dragged a bit for me (mostly when drunky was going on and on and on about how she needed a drink and had desperately messed up her life). I guessed a few times as to ""who done it"" because there were some major plot twists. Overall, I recommend and would definitely read something else written by this author."
"The book was easy to follow, not too complex of language or imagery. The characters all are some what relatable in the different sides a person can portray to who they really are. The author also does a great job of portraying the different characters feelings of disgrace, humility, confidence, bewilderment and jealousy."
"It started out ok, I was intrigued.  Up until about page 250 I was tired of hearing of the drinking problem and addiction to riding the train.  However once I arrived around page 250 I didn't put it down until it the as finished.  I could not really compare this to Gone Girl other than the twist of the story.  It did not knock my socks off and I wouldn't read it again, but it was most certainly not the worst novel I've ever read."
"""The Girl on the Train"" was almost too much for me to read. The author's characterization is astounding. There we times when I wanted to shake the protagonist and slap her silly for being so annoying, but there were other times when I would see myself in her. This book is unlike most others because it leaves you with a weird intense feeling that is hard to describe."
"I thought this novel was good, and it did engage my interest, but I also felt it was a bit like GONE GIRL because so many of the characters were emotional train-wrecks. (Sorry for the bad pun there.)  It certainly is a thriller, and it was hard to put down and really tough to predict the ending.  I cannot say that I found any of the characters sympathetic though - they were all so flawed, but I suppose that is not too far from reality."
If I could I would give this 6 stars. Read it in one day simply because I couldn't put it down!
I saw the trailer for this movie in the theater one day and decided to pick up the book. I could not put it down. I think I read through it in a day. Its a very gripping multiple narrative suspense thriller with plenty of twist and turns. It kept me on the edge of my seat up until the end.  A must read  !
"Very unexpected twists & turns. Just when you think you've got it figured out, you're taken in another direction. Definitely a page turner that keeps you on your toes. Very well written, I can't wait for the movie, and hope it does the book justice!!  I'll be thinking about this one for a while..."
"Well it was really different,I could not stop reading.glad it turned out the way it did .could have went in so many directions.Not loaded up with porn ,lovely."
I liked the mystery of the book.  I felt it got a little long in places and it was somewhat confusing until you realized who everyone was and how they were connected.  The ending was satisfying.  I was surprised in a couple of places by the behavior of the characters and surprise is a good thing when you are reading a book.  All in all it was a good book - I couldn't say great for me because it felt a little tedious in places.
"Very monotonous, predictable read. Meanders around without ever really engaging the reader finishes as it started with an anti climatic end."
"Enthralling thriller ala Hitchcock. Told in first person narrative, alternating chapters, by the three main female characters.  No simple task but done to perfection, revealing all, and nothing, at the same time.  Filled with twists and turns while giving nothing away.Read in two sittings, only from necessity of sleep and job."
"This book got off to a very slow start.  The alternating narrative added to the confusion.  However, after about a third of the way through I was totally engrossed.  Unfortunately I was able predict the outcome before it was revealed.  I also felt the author rushed the ending.  Was it a good read - of course.  Was it the caliber of ""Gone Girl"" as some have compared it to - no.  What both books had in common was two deranged female characters."
"This book was a bit too unbelievable even for fiction. It follows the lives of three women and their love intrests who all live on the same block and get to know each other through very contried circumstances. The characters were somewhat compelling but not very likeable.  I certainly wouldn't want to befriend any of the three main characters Rachael, Megan, or Anna. I found I could not identify or sympathize too much with any of them. The author switches between characters telling the storyline bouncing from each point of view.  The male counterparts were not nice guys. I found myself asking why I was reading a book about people I didn't like who did horrible things to each other and so many people involved in the plots. Just happy I don't live on that block."
The suspenseful narrative kept you guessing up until the end.  Wanted to read book before seeing movie in order to compare the written characters with the acting ones.  I'm hoping the screenplay will capture the characters as the author portrayed them so lifelike in the novel. Entertaining reading
"Overall I enjoyed this read. It was quick and held my interest. However, I don't know if I would rate it as high as everyone who told me about the book rated it. Maybe there was too much hype around the story for me and being let down was inevitable. I didn't get invested in the characters and never had a doubt that it would all work out well in the end. I'm glad I read this story and would recommend it as a beach read. But it is not the type of book which will stick in my mind long after reading. In fact, I found it somewhat forgettable."
I would recommend this suspenseful narrative to anyone in search of a good titillating drama.  Very unpredictable and a definite page turner.  Can't wait to compare and contrast the with the movie.  I look forward to definitely reading more by Paula Hawkins.
"This was one of those books that you may have a hard time putting down at night, and will likely end up staying up way too late reading! It's a great psychological thriller that keeps you guessing until the end ""who done it"". I thoroughly enjoyed the plot twists, and the antihero main character Rachel with all of her alcoholic flaws. You can't help but root for her as the underdog, despite her constant erroneous behavior. I'd highly recommend this. It has a bit of a ""Gone Girl"" feel, at least sort of similar to the mystery that the first half of that book held. Something to keep you on your toes."
"With the various narratives between three central female characters, the book has no problem grabbing your attention. But it begins to lag when Rachel's stupid decisions become tiresome. It's ok that she has flaws, being an alcoholic, but even in her sober right mind it's hard to like her because she's so pathetic and needy. Also it's frustrating when you've figured out the mystery long before the main character does. I was ready to be done when the killer started his: ""and now comes the point where I explain how I carried out my evil plan!"" monologue to the main character. It felt incredibly 1 dimensional and stale."
"I generally don't read this genre but I'd been seeing this book everywhere so I though I'd give it a try. Seeing as how it's the summer, it was only appropriate that I picked up a popular contemporary read.  As it turned out, I couldn't put the book down. It kept me on the edge of my seat until the very last page. Yes, I recommend it!"
"Although this book had been recommended by several friends who thoroughly enjoyed it, it took me a long time to get into it. I even set it down for several weeks and only returned to it because I had nothing else to read at the time. I only truly enjoyed the last 20% of the book, but even found that to be predictable. I did think the narrator's voice selection was interesting where we only knew the thoughts of the three female characters which left the two male suspects open to suspicion until the last part of the story."
"I enjoyed the book, but found that the main character was some what frustrating in that she continued to make her life miserable. It reaffirms that the problem with addition is that it affects all the people in ones life. Not just the addicts. this gave the book a dark tone."
This book kept me up late at night because I had to know what happened next. The story was told from three different characters' points of view and from two different points in time.  There were lots of twists and turns and nothing was what you would expect.  I highly recommend this book.
"I read Girl on the Train on my small Kindle which did not show the name at the top of each page clearly enough, so that I became confused regarding the identity of the specific character who was central to that particular section (no fault of the author's).  Once that confusion was cleared away, the book made perfect sense and was clearly a compelling story, well written, engaging the reader sympathetically with the characters ending with a very tense climax."
great read
"Very disappointing read.  The four main characters seem to live in a vacumn with no clues for the reader about what motivates them.  Rachel, the main character is annoying and I could not muster up any empathy for her.  Flawed characters are often fascinating, but not in this story!"
This book took a long time to really get to suspenseful and I would not consider it a thriller on any level. Most of the time is spent waiting for the main character to try to remember what happened on one of the many black out drunk episodes she experiences throughout most of the book.
"Disappointed, after all the hype.  Not believable that the murdered girl should have her own chapter in which she describes her death.  The convention of alternating chapters where each of the three women describe  their lives did not amuse me.  I found it jerky and difficult to pay attention.  I only finished the novel because it was my book club's feature of the month.  Thin story and not of lasting value.  The three men were not likable."
"It was a good read, worth owning so I can go back and read again someday.  And an interesting ending.  Not quite as riveting as I expected after all the fuss I heard.  But maybe that's my fault for setting my expectations too high?Still, a good book and I would recommend it."
"O before The Movie Was Released, Has Already Heard Good Comments About The Book, how the suspense makes you keep on reading.  Comments like these are true. The author made an excellent job.  Excellent reading, a twist at the end.  Could not have chosen a better book to read."
The book was very tedious and mediocre.  I couldn't wait for it to end. I don't see how it was such a number one bestseller for such a long time. I am an avid reader and this book was not a better book for sure. That said a lot of people loved the book.My book club not particularly. Half loved it half didn't.
"I really enjoyed this book from start to finish but I wouldn't compare it to Gone Girl. It's a great read and I found myself eager to get back to it. I wish there had been less hype about this book because I think I was expecting more. If I hadn't read all the hype I would have found it to be a good book but since my expectations were raised, I was a bit disappointed with the ending. Still, an excellent read and one I would recommend."
"I was reluctant to read this book with the description of love gone wrong, but I couldn't put it down! The way the narration switches between three women keeps the suspense building and the reader guessing. This could have been just another love triangle gone to murder, but the setup and the styling was brilliant. This was so easy to read. It was a nice change to not have guessed the killer until late into the book. Highly recommended."
The beginning was really slow moving and things didn't really start happening until the first 100 pages. Kind of confusing at first trying to backtrack between present at future. It's really only worth reading the last 60 pages or so. Not everything it was hyped up to be.
"Fascinating characters in a literary mystery kept my attention to the end. While the characters are rather unlikable, they have a starkness to them that gives insight into their lives. It's definitely not an easy read in that it's not a happily ever after kind of story tied up in a little bow. The hopelessness of the three point of view characters has a hypnotic quality and had me wanting to know the answers to the mystery. Everyone is hiding something even from themselves. Brilliantly done. I loved the themes of women's lives, on their obsessions and self-worth. It gives you something to think about."
"This is a novel that grabs you from the beginning...and pulls you further and further into its unrelenting grasp. The characters are flawed, every one of them, as we all are, I suppose. And yet, not many of us would do the things that they have done...the acts of betrayal...the actions that go too far. What is it like to love a person so strongly that you are willing to believe everything about that person, as long as you can be together? I enjoyed the author's way of going from one character to another, so that each one could be examined and discovered to be vulnerable...to be flawed. The suspense builds and the reader goes from this conclusion to another, till the mystery is finally brought to a satisfying end. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys an intense thriller and character dramatization."
"I'm sure I add nothing by telling you this book is good, but it is--very, very good.And ""easy"" read is a compliment. I tend to get bogged down with non-fiction, and sometimes I want a book that is more enjoyable. This is such a book. I was tired at work on Monday, but I had to read through the night. I couldn't put it down! :)"
"Great book! I started reading this after it was recommended for people who enjoyed Gone Girl and boy were they right! I loved this book even more. Very suspenseful and you don't expect the twists and turns that it throws at you. I highly recommend The Girl on the Train to anyone who likes a bit of romance, drama, and suspense."
"I was interested in this book when I observed previews for the movie.  I decided I wanted to read the book before deciding on seeing the movie...I was blown away.  I enjoyed the author's style of writing, her pace of the storyline...I was pleasantly pleased with the purchase."
"I really enjoyed this book. Truly a page turner that's hard to put down, and I haven't come across a book like that for awhile. I originally shied away from it because it was being compared to ""Gone Girl"" which I thought was pretty awful, but this is not even in the same league. The writing is so much better and the characters are actually believeable, unlike Gone Girl. It's not literary fiction or anything, but solid writing and a storyline that keeps you wondering what's coming next. All I could ask for in a book like this."
This is my first time to read Paula Hawkins book but she does an excellent job with her characters _ at first I had to keep them straight as I read each chapter but it doesn't take long to keep them separate and to know who is who. I recommend this book it's a good drama.
"Interesting premise, but I thought the writing was too pedestrian and the characters weren't believable portraits.  I made it through but didn't really enjoy it.  Maybe I expected too much, given the hype that accompanied first the book and then the film."
"I thought this novel was immensely engrossing. I loved the original unreliable narrator, Rachel. The cruel realities of life that are sometimes glossed over in our politically correct society were firmly able to be displayed and revealed in Girl on the Train. Comparisons to Gillian Flynn are not valid, in my opinion, but every author is original and I like the originality of this book. I am glad my sister Jeanie recommended it to me. Of course I couldn't put the book down after the first half and stayed up reading really ruining my next day. Is there a word for this? Good Book Hangover, maybe?Well worth reading and buying and a great read."
"It's rare a book comes around that I can't wait to read every night. This was it. Loved the main characters and how they were able to tell their own story. It was interesting, compelling, haunting and had me rooting for both Megan and Rachel. Can't wait to see the movie!"
I really enjoyed this book! Extremely addicting and suspenseful! I wouldn't say it's quite as good as Gone Girl- i didn't get as drawn in to this book as I did Gone Girl due to there being a little less depth and description over all. Overall really enjoyed it though.
An entertaining thriller told by a variety of participants so the story gradually unfolds with different points of view.  Some of the motivation is not so credible and the characters are all seriously flawed so it is hard to relate to anyone but the concept of the story and its telling keeps the interest to the end.
"There was a good introduction, plenty of back story and character development. Then the 'event' happened and you expect to go through the motions of solving the 'event' but it takes so long. I feel like the bulk of the middle of the book was wasted space- you could have done so much more with the story but instead it focused on all the wrong things and people. The ending is a bit of a twist although a few pages before you 'find out' you already guess it. The ending wrapped up in fewer pages than any other part of the book and could've been better. It kept me reading (because I wanted to know what happened and hoped it got better) and it was an easy read to keep my occupied on the train ride home."
"This was a terrific read but I had no surprise as to what I can only assume was the plot twist reveal late in the book. Regardless, it was a book I enjoyed and I found the characters realistic enough to feel something emotional about each one. The unpredictability of some of their actions and reactions were surprising yet completely human. I think my slight dissapointment came with the comparison to Gone Girl. I understand readers like certain types of books but I do like like the comparisons to books that are the truly outstanding ones. I understand the sales concept but more times than not it sets me up to look for something that is not there. Here,the bar was set a bit too high."
Interesting storytelling method that really gets you engaged with the characters.  I really like the 'everything is not always as it seems' plot and inevitable clash of characters in the end.  It did get a bit tedious with the repeated Rachel insecurities and depression.
"Well, I liked it but wasn't so spellbound I couldn't put it down until I finished it in one day…it took a couple weeks. I found the characters interesting, but they, nor the plot, didn't have the ""punch"" I was hoping for based upon the fact it has been on the top of the New York Times best seller list for a number of weeks. I have read books before where I simply could not sleep until I finished it, this was not one of those. However, I found it engaging enough to read it in entirety, but the end wasn't as thrilling, unpredictable, or exciting as I had anticipated. I felt sorry for the Rachel in many ways, due to her struggle with memory loss, depression, and alcoholism that I felt were very accurately portrayed. The author writes well, and I hope she comes out with something more riveting in the future!"
I liked the book. I felt it went slow in some places but picked up when she starts to remember things. I did like the complications of the characters in the story. I would recommend this book to anyone.
I felt torn between outrage of what effect alcohol has on our lives and the power that a man can have over a women. Is she too blame for letting herself sink into the comforting world of a strong man. Does alcohol create a bigger problem in an already existing problem. The answer is always yes but that doesn't mean you wouldn't go there in the same situation.The book had twists and turns in unexpected ways and I was captivated by the main character.
"I found this  book to be very interesting in how it was written.  Instead of chapters,  it's written by the perspective of the characters themselves.  It was suspenseful and I enjoyed the ending.  It kept me guessing.  Would recommend to those that like suspenseful books.  You won't be disappointed."
Great for seeing how wonderfully quick crazy turns into addiction turns into ruined LIVES. Thoroughly enjoyed it though but then I'm not an addict - by the grace of God! If you see yourself as a character in this book please please please seek professional help.
"Shipped quickly - Great seller - Book was good - Not interested in seeing the film, but enjoyed reading the story - Began to lose some interest about a 3/4 through it as it felt like the viewpoint and storyline was being repeated. Overall a decent book"
"I found it hard to get into the rythm of the book, once grasped it was a fast read/listen.. The audiobook is excellent, in fact it was because of the audio that the book became interesting.  I gave it three stars because the sequences were a little hard to follow, and because I did not like the ending at all."
I took me a little bit to get into the book but after a few chapters I was hooked. You cannot help but feel sorry for Rachel and her depressing life. She's so drunk all of the time she doesn't know reality. What a huge plot twit keeping you guessing until the end. Loved it.
"Gripping story, book counterpart to ""film noir,"" I guess is how I'd describe it.  I read this on my Kindle, and unfortunately the shift from one character's narrative to another's did not catch my attention until late in the story, because the name of the character providing the narration was so faintly imprinted at the top of that narrative, and that led to some confusion along the way.  Some readers will no doubt say that the saga is over-written and repetitive.  Still, the story has interesting twists and turns, and conveys a strong sense of what it's like to struggle with alcoholism and depression and the manner in which those maladies manifest themselves in relationships.  Of course, some potential readers might be put off by that."
"Once I realized the unravelling of this mystery required the primary character to relive her frequent drunken black outs to determine real violence from fiction, I became quickly bored.  That's all this story was - a girl who gets blind drunk 5 days a week. looses her friends, her job and her husband. She holds no respect. In fact the bad guys do the bad things in front of her, knowing that she's too wasted to witness anything and would never be believed if she reported it.I kept hoping she would turn her life around and get sober - there was some hint of that at the end.  I enjoyed the second to last chapter when the 2 arch rivals join forces to take the creepy man down."
"Wow! This book was amazing! I couldn't put it down and wanted to read it any chance I could. It was suspenseful! The main character, Rachel witnesses a couple outside their home every day from a stop on a train and becomes a bit obsessed with their lives. She names them and imagines what they are like. She envies them since her own marriage failed. The funny thing is, her exhusband remarried and lives right near this couple.  But then the lady she often sees, Megan, goes missing! It's a mystery and an obsession for Rachel. She gets to be a part of their lives through lies and her obsessive snooping. She is an unreliable narrator since she also has a bit of a problem with getting flat-out blackout no memory drunk. Such a treat to read. You will be bummed out once you finish it : ("
"Wow! This is a very different type of book. You go into it not really knowing what to expect except, it has something to do with ""a girl on a train."" It has a lot of twist & turns and surprises. The main character Rachel, is telling the tale of her sad & broken life. It gets more intense,chilling & complex as it goes. Full speed ahead! Real entertaining. Read it in no time."
"The storyline of this book never uplifts you. It is all about how everybody lies about his/her past, cheats his / her lover or husband / wife, turns to jealousy, violence, over drinking. It can't even claim to be a study of character - it does not dig profoundly enough for it. Neither is it a real thriller - lacking the action and speed.So what is it ? What did the author seek to accomplish with this story ? What did she seek to teach us ? A mystery to me"
"Wow...I could not put this book down. Extremely well written and a fantastic plot. With all the mystery and suspense books out there obsessing on the serial killer, this was a refreshing change. After all this type of murder is much more common than serial killings. The plot and murder was so everyday and the characters could really be your neighbors.....and that's what make a good murder mystery very very scary. The fact that this could really happen to you or someone you know. Nothing is scarier or more realistic than "" heat of the moment"" anger and desperation.Not a bloody butchering with disgusting descriptions of body parts strewn hither and yon to add gruesomeness to the plot.Kudos to Paula Hawkins. The rest of the "" blood and guts"" genre are going to get a run for their money with this woman."
"Excellent writing. Twists and turns that could not have been figured out before hand. I was all in for this page Turner and could not put it down.If you love thrillers with great characters along with twists, then you will love this book."
The strong voices of the characters kept me hooked to this book.  Quick read but I felt the depth of details kept the book moving forward at a slow walk to the long awaited finality of Megan's death at the end of the book.  A bit predictable but loved it nonetheless.  Felt the tone to be similar to books like Gone Girl.  I would highly recommended.
"Despite the fact that there is not a single likeable character in the story, we all have our demons and I found myself able to identify on some small level with the main character. For me, the book did not deliver on it's potential of a taut mystery with a ""didn't see it coming"" ending; instead the story was a bit clunky, messy, and all over the place, much like the main character. The writing style, however, was enjoyable and I would enjoy reading a tighter, more inventive story from this author. Overall it was an okay read for a couple days while I was taking care of someone post-minor surgery."
A good mystery well worth reading with a couple of twists and turns thrown into the mix. I would recommend it for those looking for a more contemporary plot. The use of the train is not all that original and the idea that what you see isn't always what you think it is plays out well but again isn't an original idea. However Ms Hawkins draws us into her plot with a somewhat slow beginning that eventually gets us excited to find out who the real murderer is.
"I've read a lot of books in my time, but ""The Girl On The Train"" is hands down the best book I have ever read! If you like Agatha Christie or anything remotely close to a mystery or murder mystery approved of by Alfred Hitchcock himself, then you will love this book. Don't miss your chance to read ""The Girl On The Train""."
"I wanted to read this before it came out on video and am I ever glad I did!!This book was fantastic, it made you feel pity, scared, confused, and daring all at once. This was definitely a page turner and had mysteries within the mystery. I absolutely loved this story."
"The book was slow until I was almost 80% of the way through with it. But when you get to that point, you realize that the story has been building to that moment from very early on. It's enjoyable but make sure you take the time to read it to the end and don't give up on it. It's worth it."
"I could NOT stop consuming this book because it utterly consumed me every step of the way!!I kept thinking that I just KNEW ""who done it""...but that kept changing and then folding back over into itself again and again!!A MUST READ!!"
Narrative in the first person is the best especially since this story goes back and forth between the two central female characters and follows a different timeframe with each chapter. Author's prose is such that it is easy to follow and you can visualize the characters in each setting.  No spoiler alerts here !  Can't wait for the movie this Fall!
This book is just eh. Not anything special and I don't see how it could be even considered for a movie. It's definitely not a surprise ending like Gone Girl the only surprise I got was how the character manipulated Rachel. What really bothered me through this whole story was that every character had very little or no back story which made this a fast read but also made you kind of think where are these peoples friends and family? The character with the most backstory is Rachel and hers isn't even about why her mother won't help make her terrible life better. This book is good but I wouldn't buy it either wait for cheaper paperback version or pick it up at the library.
"A chaotic who-dun-it that still manages to be predictable. Kudos to the narrative writing style Of Paula Hawkins, which is pacey, blurry aND captivating at times. The book is a litle contrived by using unreliable point of narration in a rather obvious way. It is nevertheless worth the read"
"Thoroughly engrossing and satisfying read. A page turner that kept me guessing. Same positive verdict from the rest of my book club who selected it. Both character and plot driven for a nice complex storyline. My sister had been trying to get me to read it for ages, and she was right. Highly recommended for losing yourself in a compelling mystery, plus watching to see what the trainwreck of a main character is going to do next!"
"Overall, it was a good read. Just like a large majority, it was difficult to get into. However, it did get much better. I mostly continued reading to see the differences in the book compared to the future motion picture. In the end, I would recommend this book to a friend, but it's definitely not the next ""Gone Girl."""
"Ok, I get that these types of books are really popular (the women in my book club loved it) but I don't know why. Yes, it was interesting at first, and definitely a page turner for a point, but the outcome was so pat and felt contrived to me. I wanted it to be more I interesting, and I wanted the characters to have more depth. I just don't think it's clever enough for an avid reader. Plus, I the lead character annoyed the hell out of me!"
"I honestly do not know what the ""hoopla"" is about this book....I have never disliked a major character so much. I had the plot figured out by the fourth or fifth chapter and almost stopped reading the book (which I NEVER do!). I just hoped that the conclusion would surprise or at least inspire me...it did neither..."
"This page turner reminds me of English mystery writers of my mothers generation. Well written, well thought out, and cleverly presented. Some of the narrative seemed repetitious, such as the repeated descriptions of black out, but overall, the suspense built nicely, and came to clever conclusion. Talented author; hope to see more of her."
"Up until the end I just had no idea! I could not put this book down, I needed answers! However I did not really care for any of the characters. Usually I can meet them where they're at and empathize or sympathize... Nearly every character was extremely unlikable  to  me."
"How do you even describe this?  Told from the POV of three different women, all flawed and, well, crazy. Well written and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The author uses some misdirection along the way along with unreliable narrators.This is probably the least coherent review I've ever written. Right now I just feel like I want to go shower to wash off the remnants of these people."
Great book with quite a twist. Very hard to put down. To start it was a bit hard because of the changes in the women so had to remember who was headed at the beginning of the chapter bu once I got around that I really enjoyed it. Went to see the movie as well and really enjoyed that also.
"A quick read and suspenseful, a perfect light vacation read where you stop and go with your reading! The plot was complex, but not overly so that you couldn't come back to it after setting your book down for a while. I think the overall twist was one that wasn't predictable, and kept you gripped till the end."
"This mystery was told from the perspective of three women who were all living lives of quiet desperation, although outwardly two seemed to have perfect suburban lives.  It kept me speculating and wondering up to the last few chapters just how the violence really played out.  Couldn't stop reading it!"
I thought from the sample the book started of dull but it's just the first 10 pages maybe. I literally couldn't put my phone down. I always find it easier to read with a black background and white letters. I'm now interested in other books by the offer
"I knew this story was not going to be pretty; after all, the main character is a pathetic drunk and a compulsive liar.  Every person in this sordid little drama has something to hide, and the book is written in such a way that the hidden parts don't fit together 'til the very end. The rotating viewpoints got to be tedious and confusing, especially since I wasn't able to read many chapters at one sitting. If you read this novel as an e-book, the repeated chapter headings with the same names will make it difficult to keep your place in the story line. I agree with many other reviewers; there was not a single character in this book that had any redeeming qualities. That said, I can't say I hated it; they all got exactly what they deserved from each other, as a bunch of scheming, selfish, violent liars."
"I truly enjoyed reading this book...it was one of those books you have a hard time putting down.  The story that intertwined the lives of the characters is beautifully written, beautifully detailed, and keeps you intrigued.  I give it 5 stars.  I hope the movie does it the justice it deserves."
"Since this was one of this Summer's popular reads I decided to download the book and give it a chance. The premise seemed interesting enough so I started reading. I ended up reading the book in 2 days (in between working and relaxing on my couch). I really enjoyed this book and recommend it to those who are fans of Gone Girl (which I am not, but it is similar). I have friends who have read the book and they found the main character Rachel to be rather annoying, however; I related to Rachel so this was not the case for me but it may be for you. I would give it a chance and be prepared to be sucked into the story."
"A good read, lightly mysterious with some suspense. Enjoyed reading from multiple characters' points of view. Sometimes novels are difficult to read when the main subject/person isn't particularly likable, which was the main drawback for me while reading this story. Just something to keep in mind"
"I didn't like this book as much as I though I would. The storyline is not particularly fast paced and it took me longer than expected to finish it. I figured out who the killer was half-way through the book and was not surprised by the ending. Overall, this book way okay but there are far better books to read."
"I am always drawn to stories told in first person and this book is a great one.  The story as it unfolds, is told by the three women in it.  These are real women---flawed but so human.  One has a problem with alcohol, one a problem with restlessness and fidelity and one has compromised for security and a ""dream"" life.  You will find yourself annoyed with them at times and at other times cheering for their small victories.  The story involves a disappearance of one of the women and how the other women and the men in their lives are all drawn into the mystery.  The plot is intriguing and clever the way it unfolds.  It builds to a great ending that ties everything and everyone together.  All questions come together and are answered.  I couldn't put the book down until I found out what happened!"
"Twists and turns of unexpected measure.  I can't wait to see how the movie portrays this scandalous story, though I doubt it will do it justice.  Very enticing.  Was hard to put down and read smoothly.  Gave enough information without being boring or left feeling unfinished."
"Enjoyed this well-paced thriller/chiller. It was well written and was voiced by 3 women, Rachel, a complete drunken mess of a woman, Megan, not much better who had serious issues other than alcoholism, and Anna, a pathetic Stepford Wife, only wanting to stand by her man. Not as good as Gone Girl, but a good psycho thriller, nonetheless."
"A main character that was annoying and constantly made decisions that no normal human being would make...a side character that I'm still confused on what her purpose was... and another side character that actually has an interesting storyline,  she just barely got any spotlight."
"If you have ever taken a train to work in New York, Chicago, Boston, London, etc., you will identify with elements of this story. The plot wanders some but in the end it delivers. I found it an entertaining read, fast paced and well written. I didn't like the main character but I suppose that was the point."
I enjoyed this book quite a bit. The premise of the story was made so much better by the lead character having alcohol induced black outs. I've definitely had a black out or two and the inability to remember things is brutal. I ended up reading this in three sittings. I'm hoping the upcoming movie will do it justice.
"I enjoyed this story and the way it was presented, moving among and between the perspectives of  Megan, Rachel, and Anna. Best advice: if you read the book first, It spoils the movie; if you see the movie first, you probably won't finish reading the book."
"It was a good start and it draws you in. My first thought was that it was a copy of the Gone Girl book- same tempo.  But by the middle of the book the characters are hard to relate to as the author, in pursuit of tension, keeps changing them from good to bad.  Oh, you thought this person was a good guy?  Well you were fooled, and now he's a bad guy.  It's a tactic you can use once but several times?  I got kind of bored with the back and forth and in the end you can't really relate to the characters anymore.  The lead character is kind of pathetic and starts to become tedious.  The ending is kind of ridiculous when the ""bad guy"" acts in a way I thought was not in keeping with the build-up of his character.  It is an ok beach read and some will probably like it but it's not a story you will remember after a few months."
"Girl on the Train is the story of a brokenhearted young women  (Rachel) whose husband has left her for another women.  She seems to have lost control of every part of her life as she obsesses about it.  The pace is fast as we enter Rachel's  mind because of her obsessive compulsive circular thoughts.  There are three voices in this story which is good because one could get very tired of Rachel's chatter.  Going back and forth between these different voices builds suspense and we begin to wonder whose voice is the real story.  There are always questions.  First impressions do not last very long.  While I became tired of Rachel's angst, there was enough going on in this story to keep me turning the pages.  I would recommend this book for a good absorbing read."
"The narrative style that alternates between three of the main characters is a clever and fascinating way to tell a story about love and marriage. The entire novel is an interesting commentary on the role played by memory, perception and observation and how little of it can be trusted.This is not a story for those seeking flawless heroines and heroic men. All of the characters are deeply flawed. The three main women - Rachel, Megan, Anna are compelling nonetheless. They make terrible mistakes and use incredibly poor judgement. Alcoholism, lying and cheating are not held up as excuses for their destructive behavior. Above all, they are human. The author brought all of these characters together in a skillful, although not totally unexpected way.Four stars because the end was a little too neat."
"I'm about half way through and so far this book is fantastic. Such a great story line with lots of baggage from the main characters! Trust me, when I say, you will not be able to put this book down. Will give an update once finished.....which will not be much longer at all!"
Very good psychological mystery.  I enjoyed how the story was told through the different characters and how the plot was presented through them.  It is a fast read and holds your interest throughout.  Read the book before the movie comes out this fall.  It will be interesting to compare the two.
"I loved the story. It kept me intrigued the entire time. At first it was a bit difficult going from each women's point of view, but once I got familiar with their story, it was easy. I also found just a few spelling/grammatical errors, which is something that just bothers me a little. I am really looking forward to watching the movie after reading the book!"
"Reminded me of Gone Girl in terms of a murder mystery that has characters that aren't very likable and you're never quite sure what to believe. It was a bit of a page turner as I did want to know whodunit, but by the end I just wanted to slap the main woman character...she bugged me so much!  I will say it was an interesting glimpse into the power of alcoholism and how easy it can be slip into it, but still, by the end, I really had no sympathy for her."
"This book took over 100 pages to finally get me interested.  Do note, that I am reader who will always read to the end even if I don't like the book.  I liked the story just not the writing!!  Too much back and forth with the people and the dates.  I would not read another book by this Arthur."
"I had a difficult time in the beginning with the different names, time frames etc. But once I got a handle on that, the rest was a real page turner. I am so looking forward to seeing Emily Blunt play the role(s).....Thanks for the opportunity to review and I would recommend this book. It is a novel but also a thriller mystery!"
"I could not put it down.  Some of the timing/person switching got a bit confusing,, but I was reading quickly to see what happens! Nice amount of twisting.  Good character development on the protagonist.  Some more development on the men might make the book even better, but no complaints!"
Couldn't put this down! Can't wait for the movie! Highly recommend this book to those that love psychological thrillers. Wonderful!
"The book started well, but began to drag halfway through, and towards the end it was very tough slogging. I couldn't wait to be finished. One expects a good mystery story to build in suspense, not peter out as this book did . Character development is not necessarily an essential part of a mystery. Even so, the characters in this novel were annoying to hysterical, and I never cared what happened to them."
"The story is told through the eyes of the major characters.  In order to switch among them, I had to be very deliberate in going forward to make the shift.  As a seasoned train-traveler I can see how a passenger could be curious about the households she passes.  It's a back-door perception that propels her into a murder mystery when she insinuates herself into the lives of the people she sees, including her ex-husband's new wife."
"The story moves quite quickly which kept me interested throughout. Switching narration keeps the book entertaining and the authors writing style is smooth and easy to follow. At times I felt the story was contrived which made it difficult to really relax into the story. This is the reason for giving the book three stars.If you are looking for an easy. entertaining read, this is the book for you."
This book got rave reviews. A close friend and myself hated it. It drags on and on incessantly. I kept waiting for it to get good. It didn't!
"I was skeptical about buying the book based on some of the reviews, but I am so glad I did. I finished the book in less than a week and every time I went to read it, I found myself unable to put it down.It was slightly confusing at first with the dates all mixed up but it got more understandable the further I read into it.I loved it and would recommend this book to anyone who likes a bit of a thrill."
"Good thriller, could not put it down. I was worried I would be confused with the changing of the characters, but it is important to know what is happening to the characters.  It's easy reading with a surprise d ending.  I give it four stars."
"It bothers me that they compare this book to Gone Girl, as the ending to Gone Girl was terrible and the characters unlikeable. This book has a great ending and you feel bad for Rachel and her misfortunes. The audiobook was excellent as well with great narrators. I'm excited to see the movie this Fall (I skipped the Gone Girl movie). Highly recommended!"
"A really great read! I couldn't put it down, and most importantly, couldn't figure out what was going to happen until it happened! Very very well written and suspenseful. It was every bit as good as ""Gone Girl,"" which was also excellent. I can't think of anything to say that won't give away the ending, but I urge everyone to read this book!"
"This was a fairly well written thriller that sucks you in wanting to find out what really happened, so you keep reading until the bitter end even though you're not exactly enjoying it.  There is no one to care about because all the characters are utter miserable, wretched, repulsive people without a single redeeming quality.  I don't know if the reader is supposed to sympathize with any of the three women, but I sure as heck didn't.  The character that represents the main POV, Rachel Watson, is utterly stupid and just the worst.  So even though I was hooked into the mystery itself, I hated being in the heads of all three women because they were all horrible people.  The men were all one-dimensional as well, so I was not surprised when everything was finally revealed."
This book was recommended to me by a friend. It was great from the beginning to the end and was hard for me to put down. I was intrigued by the preview of the movie but I don't think it could compare with the details of the story. You won't be disappointed.
I didn't like any of the characters.
"I normally do not like books that switch back and forth between characters, but this book made it work.  It made the story move along and wasn't hard to follow.  I love a good thriller and just when I thought I had it figured out, I would be surprised.  Quick, easy read."
I read it from start to finish and never could care much about anything that happened. Felt like a terribly done version of Gone Girl (which was fantastic). I never felt anything for any of these characters so I had a hard time connecting to the story as a whole.
"The entire story led up the ending and everything made sense.  Beautifully written, you felt that you could relate to each character.  I could see the entire book come to life in my mind by the amazing descriptive sentences of  this book.  I cannot wait for another book by Paula Hawkins!"
"I really enjoyed the character development in this story.  Also, the constant rethinking and remembering of things while trying to solve the mystery.  I kept thinking I had it all figure out, but then kept second guessing.  It kept me interested the entire time."
"I've been up until midnight the last two nights finishing this book. Once I got past the halfway point, I couldn't put it down! I loved the character build-up, and the plot kept me guessing and made me feel like anything was possible. In the end, the surprises kept coming until almost the last page. There were about 5 different times throughout the book that I was convinced I'd figured it all out, only to be thrown another curve again and again. Highly recommend this book (unless you enjoy getting to sleep at a decent hour...in that case, save this one for vacation or a weekend). Great read."
"I had seen quite a bit about this book and was looking forward to reading it.  I'm sorry to say I was extremely disappointed.  I came close to putting it away several times, but it drives me crazy not to finish a book.  It crept in an excruciatingly slow and depressing way throughout the first half of the book.  There wasn't a single likable character, no one to pull for or with whom I could identify.  Again, it was extremely depressing.  The story finally started to move just past the halfway point, but even then, it was hard to be interested in the outcome because I just didn't care about the characters.  The premise of the story is interesting.  That's why I gave it 2 stars."
"I'm astounded with what happened in this novel!  What a twist.  Loved most of the characters, never liked Anna from the beginning, Rachel was sweet, kind, and nosey, Tom was good, and so was Scott, Megan was just a very confused girl but she grew up in the little time she was in the book.  I really liked this book."
"I was so excited to read this book.  I really enjoyed the book overall, but the ending became predictable too soon.  I really wanted the shock factor that so many speak of, but it ended in disappointment for me.  A great read overall."
"I almost put this book aside, simply because of the number of comma splices, something I'm seeing more and more often these days.This book was slow starting, and I found it impossible to ever identify with the protagonist. And at the end, I still couldn't figure out, if her husband cared enough about her to marry her, why did he set out to destroy her? Because she drank too much? But apparently, she'd done that before--he just drove her to more of it. All truly good books give you something you can sympathize--or at least emphasize--with, but not this one. Yet, there were chapters where I was intrigued, just waiting to see what this rather weird character was going to do next."
"This novel as an audiobook was quite enjoyable, but I'll have to chalk that up to the three fantastic female narrators, for the pace of the story and the structure of the chapters becomes somewhat tedious. When I would switch to reading this through Kindle, I somewhat lost my interest. I felt that the story was a little too basic for my liking, but I did like the ""Hitchcockian"" undertones. In the end the plot became somewhat predictable, but it will keep you engaged enough to read through to the end. I thought that the length of this novel was perfect to tell this story."
"I found this book to be extremely slow starting and confusing. You must be very careful when reading this book that you pay close attention to the dates and characters you are reading about.  This book flips from one person to another listing the dates and names of the characters in each chapter.  Many times I was going to stop reading the book but stuck with it.  It did improve after the first 100 pages or so.  I did finish the book, finally, but did enjoy parts of it.  The ending was not a surprise to me. Overall if you want a slow moving book in the beginning and gets better the more you read this book is it."
"When you hear the term psychological thriller, it fits into a certain genre. The Girl on the Train pretty much is all about psychology. Told in the first person in the perspective of three women whose lives are inextricably intertwined through the men in their lives. The essence of the story is about emotional and psychological manipulation and the resultant self perception left at the end of it. I found the novel captivating and the whodunit side of it absorbing. There are questions asked throughout. Whose side is who on? Read it and find out, you won't be disappointed."
"The author's point of view is unique and very engaging.  This is a ""who-done-it"" told by an untrustworthy source, and that source is the only one who can figure out what happened.  It's not a perfect novel but it is very engrossing and very different.  It makes you think, and guess, and then reassess, before you finally have the whole picture."
"While some plot points stretched credibility a bit, this did not really matter very much in the long run. This is a great read. Told from three different viewpoints, the central mystery unfolds through first person testimony of the participants. Never dull."
I did not like the characters.  The story dragged on until the very end.  So sorry I bought this book.
I very much enjoyed the book.  There were twists and turns enough for anyone.  Every time I thought I had it figured out. something else would happen.  I enjoyed it and would recommend it.
"Sometimes a little hard to follow, each chapter is from a different persons point of view, which is why only 4 stars instead of 5.  However, it's one of those books, you just want to keep reading.  Took me only a few days to finish because I had a hard time putting it down."
Terrible book. Bad writing and a heroine who has no judgement and continues to make one bad decision after another. Very annoying story.
"I had a gut feeling to stop reading about 20% through and wished I'd listened to it. The time on the NYT Best Sellers list encouraged me to keep reading. The book was formulaic, the characters one-dimensional and the ""twist"" laughable. I recommend passing on this one."
One of the best books I've read in some time. I'd been in a funk of reading and not finishing books and this took no effort at all. The characters were so well fleshed out and so flawed and I was completely sympathetic to most of them. Loved it. Can't wait for more books from this author.
"I know this was made into a movie and everyone seems to like it, but I was disappointed in the main character. I felt she was a very weak person and this is why I did not like the book. Besides the main character, the story is interesting and has twists and turns throughout the book."
This book was easy to read and exciting. There were so many twists in the story. The beginning was confusing as the narrator changes and you don't know the characters yet but soon in to the book you get it and become hooked. I can't wait to see if the movie is as good as the book.
"This novel has many layers of feelings, something I don't usually care for in my fiction. In The Girl on the Train I still don't care for it. Hysteria rules the plot and I really can't understand how the characters are so muddled up. Overall I give it 4 stars for the twist in the end."
"I was interested in reading this after I saw the preview for the movie. I really thought I knew what the twist would be, but it still caught me off guard. A little more of a sad story than I was expecting, but it's a great murder mystery. Definitely recommended for adults."
"I really enjoyed this book. I know a lot of people in the reading community have said that they don't like the character development, but I didn't have a problem with it. I don't really think the goal in this story was ever to like the characters, maybe just to sympathize with them. I read it pretty fast and was eager to get to the end. The concept was very intriguing and I would/ have recommended it to many people already."
"I didn't like this book.  The story is so sad, about a divorced woman's life, and what her memories and a chance view of her former neighborhood did to cause what ensued.  The relationships described are unpleasant and unlikely, unless all those soap operas are true after all.  Some of the characters are well-defined and interesting."
"Cool story. I started reading it because I watched the trailer to the movie. The books are always better than the movies.I struggled with the first few chapters, but once you get used to the writing style of the author it gets easier.Quick blunt ending, a little bit predictable. Good book."
"Loved the idea of imagining what people are like and their lives as you glimpse a second of their lives as the train you are riding on flies by.Sometimes we all look at familiar landmarks on our way to work and think we know what happens inside them.  The book moved a bit slowly for me however, but the concept of telling the story from the prospective of the different characters was interesting."
"I found the whole story confusing because of the author's character perspective. It all came together at the end, but I wasnt sure I really cared. The story is told by several characters who may/may not already know one another, using names that may/may not be the right ones. I found the alcoholism aspect of the story to be cloying and that was probably the intent. I think there are other books I'd recommend ahead of this one."
"One of the best psychological thrillers I have read. Much like a train, trundling speedily through a clearing, almost stopping at a warning, the unrelenting, surprising turns, with the familiarity of a daily commute, the story jolts the reader from the seat."
"A friend recommended this book, but I was in the middle of so many things and reading another book. Here I am, a couple of months later....suffice it to say, it held my interest until the very last word! Had to read it night and day!"
"Wow!  This was a very different, yet very powerful book. You are constantly guessing who ""did it"". There are just lots of twists and turns. The adage, ""Things are seldom as they appear to outsiders.""  Paula Hawkins' writing style is truly unique."
I could not wait to read this book when I saw the trailer for the up coming movie. I am always trying to be the detective as I love these kinds of thrillers. You did a very good job at kieping me very intrigued. Loved this book very much. Now I cannot wait to see the movie. Thank you.
"This was a solid novel. There was a ton of hype surrounding it so after reading quite a few reviews, I bought it.While it was a decent read, I don't get the hype. I spent 3/4 of the book waiting for something to happen.i started and stopped about a hundred times but it was OK. The comparisons to Gone Girl really need to stop."
"It started out interestingly enough but went downhill quickly. I started skimming because the plot moved so slowly & story became grindingly repititous. Typical Hollywood or TV's Lifetime movie ending. Really disappointing.  No creativity here. Probably written in hopes of selling movie rights. The hype was just that, hype to sell the book. Interesting characters and format but just didn't hold my interest. Couldn't wait to be done with it!"
"I was okay. I found the characters hard to believe. If you were not a fan of Gone Girl, you will probably not like this book either. It was just okay. Fairly predictable. It felt like the author was trying to take you on a ride, but it was too forced. I enjoy books that simply tell a good story instead of trying to weave in complex, often unbelievable characters and plot lines just to keep you entertained."
"Read this book for bookclub - really didn't care much for it.  There are three narrators, and for the first half of the book I thought they were all the same person with a multiple personality disorder.  Didn't find a single major character likeable.  Do not care for unreliable narration.  Certainly don't like reading endlessly about the exploits and misadventures of a black out drunk.  Don't really get what all the hype was about."
"This one kept me interested. As I got closer to the end it was hard to put down. I liked how the author tied the story together, leaving few, if any, loose ends. I don't want to give the story away. As you read the story, you don't realize some of the characters are as twisted as they are. But when you finish, you can see it.  It's a good one. Pick a suspect about a quarter of the way through and see how it develops."
"Highly disappointed in this story. Based on the reviews, I was expecting a fast paced, suspenseful story. This was not fast paced, and it was drawn out, not suspenseful. Also somewhat confusing to keep up with the jumping between characters, but maybe that's just me."
"Despite the fact that this novel is a ""Best Seller "" it was difficult for me to get engaged. Could not identify with with any of the characters and at the risk of making a biased comment, it may be a good ""women's "" book. As far as being a  mystery , it doesn't even come close to P.D.Lang's ""Original Sin "".I conclude that maybe it's a good ""chick"" book but it was a almost a waste of time for me.Robert"
Dont know what all the hoopla was about for this novel. It was okay but i came to the realization that i didnt care what happened to any of the basically mundane characters. Veru surprised this novel was on the best seller list for so long. Obviously i didn't get it.
"Started out a little slower than I thought it would, but I knew it would pick up, and holy cow did it ever! I couldn't put it down and the description used made it totally play in my head like I could see everything! If you love psychological thrillers, this is your kind of book!"
It takes a long time to get the feel for this book. I was over half way through before I had untangled all the names and the way the time line jumps about.The multi-voiced narrative doesn't help.None of the characters made an impression on me and I wasn't too bothered who the murderer turned out to be.
"I read this book because my co-workers said it was a great read....Well it was not, at least not for me.  Hated this book, too depressing and mundane couldn't stand Rachel, too weak! Found synopsis online and glad I didn't waste my time finshing it.  Wish I could get my money back."
I do not understand how this book has temained on the best selling list. I thought the story line was confusing and I could not get invested in the lives of the characters.
"I never saw if coming!  Things were just rolling along with stories about the characters, their foibles, their lacks of judgment and WHAM, the twist that was totally unexpected.  You get to know this woman and her fantasies and watch her weave her way into the lives of total strangers only to realize that she may have stepped too far into their lives.  This book is great for a book club.  I loved this book.  It's a fast read and a real page-turner."
"I liked the story, but wasn't thrilled."
I read this book thinking that it was going to be another hyped up piece of garbage. Boy was I wrong. This was one of the best books I have read in a long time. Paula Hawkins has earned her stripes and belongs up there with the greats. I love suspense and this book knocks you over with it.
"I didn't score this book too highly as it wasn't really my style, and it just had no likable characters in it. A very depressing story. But in its defense, the author did make me want to finish it to see what happened in the end. I think this would probably make a very good movie.There are enough other reviews that will give you the gist of the story, so I will not go into that."
"This mystery was told from the perspective of three women who were all living lives of quiet desperation, although outwardly two seemed to have perfect suburban lives.  It kept me speculating and wondering up to the last few chapters just how the violence really played out.  Couldn't stop reading it!"
"While the writing and character development were great, I unfortunately found the book to be a little predictable. I found myself relating to certain emotions and feeling, which is what I loved about the book, but I knew exactly what was coming. Overall, still a really good read."
"While touted as a ""must read"", the women characters were not appealing or likeable.  The girl on the train is a self-pitying whining drunk.  Her best friend and landlord allows herself to be taken advantage of.  The women whom the girl on the train observes from the train  and interacts with beginning mid-way through the story are hiding terrible secrets and crimes.....Not a pleasant read"
"I love first person narrative - and this book lets you into the minds of all the ""players"".  I read this book in two days - couldn't wait to return to it whenever I had the chance.  I love thrillers and some are getting so predictable - this book is entirely different - I highly recommend it as a quick satisfying read.  You won't guess the outcome. ( It might also make you think twice before you pour that second or third glass of wine!)"
This is a great book. I have not traditionally read thrillers and I decided that I would read some for the summer. I started with this one and it really lived up to expectation. It was dark and twisty and kept me interested until the very end. I liked being strung along and surprised and I liked finding out when I was right about my hunches. This is not a feel-good book but it was very enjoyable.
"I thoroughly enjoyed The Girl on the Train.  It was a fast read and provided wonderful insights into the perils of addiction and depression as well as the self loathing created by an abusive marriage. I felt that it was beautifully written and was a real page- turner. This book can be compared to Gone Girl. While the subject may be dark, it is highly engaging and can be up lifting. I highly recommend this book."
"Slow, lots of back and forth amongst the characters. Took too long to finally get into it. It will make for an interesting movie as it will be more concise"
The book was good but I found myself not liking the characters. The character development was good but the 3 main characters are women that I found to not be admirable in my opinion and made it a bit hard for me to get through the middle of the book where the story is starting to develop.
"Rachel lives in her head. She imagines the life of a couple seen daily through a train window. Haven't we all created stories about people seen in passing. It's a fantasy that draws her into a web of deceit, betrayal and murder fueled by alcoholic blackouts and fuzzy memories. Rachel can be whiney and endlessly self indulgent almost forcing the reader to want to skim ahead. Ultimately her thoughts are demonstrative of her character flaws."
"I liked how it kept you guessing till almost the end.I don't care for books where I can anticipate what will happen during not just the ending but throughout the telling of the story.The thing that I didn't like is that the writing and dialogue don't match the location.It is written as if it takes place in America.I'm surprised, as this would be the critique of any first year writing teacher or writing group.However,this made it easier to read."
"I thought this read was so good! I felt like I was right there in the story. It keeps you guessing and it awesome. I would recommend everyone read this! Plus the movie comes out in October, so hurry and read it before it comes out! The author did a great job, so good that they made a movie."
I saw this novel on the best seller list so I decided to read it. I cannot really judge it accurately because it is not my type of novel. The first few chapters were complex and slow but I stayed with it. As the pieces came together the story held my interest. The fact that I finished this book speaks for itself.  It is possible I should have given it four but for me it was not a rapid page turner.
"I wasn't expecting much when I picked this book up to read. I just wanted to read it before the movie was released. Now I'm hoping, but not expecting, the movie to be as good as the book. The twists and turns are definitely worth wading through some fairly depressing storyline. Well done."
"I thought the narration was first person for 4 or 5 chapters so I felt the narrator was multiple personalities. I finally realizedthere were several narrators, started the book over, and it became a fascinating and interesting  book. Complex and flawed(real) people who become attractive as they develop (all but one). A great read."
"I really enjoyed the way this was written.  It is told from the perspective of the three main women in the book, though mostly from the main protagonists point of view.  It is also told over two different time periods, so we hear the story of one of the women from an earlier timeframe.  It was a light easy read, but the twist on writing style kept it interesting for me, and I ripped through this book in no time."
"It's like Paula Hawkins grabbed me by the hand and led me exactly where she wanted me to go.  The story develops beautifully and the characters are so real I could almost touch them.  I loved it,  every twist and turn was like riding a rollercoaster."
"I read this book in one sitting, stopping only for refreshments and ablutions. I was engrossed from the minute I started, and found myself trying to guess who had done what to who. The idea seems so simple, you sit on a train every day, morning and night heading to and from work, you see the same houses at the same time, and at times the same people within them. Not knowing names, you begin to make up stories about them, and then one day, one day it all changes. You see something and everything changes."
"There is so much amazing work in this novel that I can't do it justice here. Everything; plot, characters, pacing, and especially the expertly done first person pov, is simply amazing. You have to experience it yourself. Plan on not being able to stop reading once you start though."
"I won't review the plot because I hate it when reviewers do that.  You all know the gist of the story.  As I was reading it I was thinking Gone Girl again and I guess many others were thinking the same thing.  None (and I mean none) of the characters were in even the slightest way likable.  I finished the book because I wanted to know how the author would bring this to an end, but not because I felt it was a good book.  It was rather painful to read.  All I can say is if you want to read it, go ahead, but for me it wasn't an enjoyable read. It was more, read it because everyone else is, and my book club picked it and now I can say I read it."
"Given the vast popularity already of this book, I expected it to be a good read & it was. I really liked the concept of the book, being a woman daydreaming about the lives of the people she sees daily from the train, we've all been there & I also liked the structure of the book, very much like Jodi Picoult. The story becomes quite dark & disturbing however the further you progress into the book, but I found myself still turning pages & wanting to get to the end & find out what happened. Unlike some of the other readers, I did not guess the end & it came as quite a surprise & twist. A good read, despite the rather unsettling turn of events & subject matter."
"It was not as good as I expected. Had friends who had read it and although I enjoyed it I did not like it as much as others. I enjoyed the ""view from the train"" as the story was written. Just did not connect with ""the girl"" through the writing."
"I loved this book.... I think. I mean when you read a book in two days - when you can't put the book down, that means you love it right? But I feel weird about it though. I didn't develop a connection with any of the characters & actually I either really disliked them or else I found them extremely annoying. But, I couldn't put the book down! This is the first time I've ever read a book and had this reaction. I'm giving it 5 stars because it had me flipping pages wanting to figure out the plot in an all consuming way."
"I truly enjoyed this book. In my personal opinion, the writing could have been much better- the stories were very jumpy. But the further you get into the book the better you understand each person and their connection to the core of this story. I am not much of a reader but the story intrigued me- reeled me in. It was a quick and enjoyable read, with a twist that will make you gasp. I recommend this book to any and all!"
"I was somewhat surprised by the ending . This book held my interest once I got into it( it did take awhile). In one sense I can see that this could be realistic which held my interest even more, I enjoy the possibility of reality with excitement and a bit of the macabre."
"I don't usually read thrillers, so this was a fun break for me!  The story really builds upon itself & creates a good deal of intrigue.  The ""who dun it"" aspect is really fun.  I'm not sure how the thriller part stands up to others of its genre, but I can definitely wholeheartedly recommend the book if you don't read a lot of thrillers & just want a little taste (without much gore or strongly disturbing material).  Though I felt it fell a part a little in the end (causing me to only give 4 stars), this book was absolutely a fun read!"
"The narrative made the story interesting, but many characters were underdeveloped. The twist was predictable, but once there was revelation the story closed without fulfilment.  Worth the effort.  I think the movie will be grand, but don't read the story first."
"A great exploration into the flawed human psyche. The writer manages to paint a picture of action and characters without muddying the waters with cluttered vocabulary, or grimy sex scenes. An easy and enjoyable read; in my opinion, suitable for teenagers."
"Quite disappointed in this book, all the hype is not justified. The author writes well but I thought the plot a comparatively poor imitation of Gone Girl, doesn't have anything like the depth of that book. Rachel's story got so tedious, with her endlessly getting drunk and blacking out. The whole thing had little substance for me, with one dimensional and very unsympathetic characters. Seemed to me like the author admired Gone Girl and then wrote something fairly similar to get a quick best-seller. Seems to have worked for her. I just hope her next book has more originality and depth."
"I got this because the movie was coming out, knowing nothing about it. Paula Hawkins really knows how to hit you right in the feels. I was feeling Rachel's anxiety throughout that whole book. Amazing character development. Read in a few sittings. Highly recommend."
"I bit of a slow start, but it grew on me.  I figured out who the 'bad guy' was pretty early,  but the author kept me second guessing myself.  Quite an insightful journey into alcoholism,  infidelity,  mental illness,  motherhood,  and all the nuisances within a marriage."
"I did have some trouble getting into it. I had to go back a couple times because I wasn't sure who the author was talking about. It is also current time and then one year back. But once I got into it, I could not put it down. I was sad when it ended...I can not wait to see the movie."
"Troubled,, jobless alcoholic Rachel aimlessly rides the train daily, observing as she goes the events in two homes,  one inhabited by her former partner and his new wife, another by a couple she fantasizes about for their perfect life...until a murder occurs, and eventually Rachel's hapless meddling links all the characters. I'm not usually good at predicting the denoument, but I saw the end to this coming long before it actually happened, and the characters were uniformly so unappealing and artlessly drawn that I didn't much care .  This doesn't belong in the pantheon of great thrillers, that's for sure."
It took me a long while to get into the story but then bam all of a sudden couldn't put it down until it was finished.  Great book has your mind twisting and turning.  Glad I read the book and did not go see the movie.  Excellent.
"The book started off very slow and at times was difficult to figure out who was who in the story as each chapter was from someone else's perspective and went back and forth in time. Only at mid-point did the story line get better and I was able to keep the characters straight. Overall, it's not a book I would re-read as I found none of the characters like able."
I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I slowed down towards the end because I just didn't want it to end.  I only read it because I wanted to before seeing the movie and I am so glad that I did. I will definitely be watching for what this author releases next.
"Enjoyed this book a lot. I read it in two sittings because I was obsessed and couldn't put it down. It did skip around a bit between characters from chapter to chapter, but overall, I liked it. I will say, I was looking forward to seeing the movie- it was terrible."
"Great read. There were way to many characters at the beginning of the book. It was also confusing to jump back and forth on each chapter with different people, past and present. After I figured out the characters, it was a great book. Intriguing and educational, couldn't put it down."
"I personally LOVED this book!  The characters were believable and I felt like I could see story line through their eyes, it's how I would have felt if I were in the same situation.  It was a real page turner and kept me wondering who killed who. I love a good twist at the end that catches me off guard and takes my breath away!!"
Took me forever to get into the book.  I was over half thru before I got interested enough and understood which characters she was writing about.  Did not enjoy the style of jumping around from character (chapter) to character.  Wanted to quit reading it almost everytime I picked it up until I was about 3/4 thru the book.....then it went almost too fast to the conclusion.  Won't pursue that author again.
"I would recommend this book. It started slow and since I didn't read a synopsis of it before starting, had no idea where it was going. However, about a third of the way through. I couldn't put it down.  All of the pieces of the mystery start to fall into place faster and faster. It's fun to have the different perspectives of the three main women. Nobody is completely innocent."
"Was hoping I would not be able to figure it out, sadly, I did well before the end. Normally the book is better, but I'm hoping the movie is."
"The narrator and protagonist is a boozy mess who randomly and suddenly solves the whodunit mystery. Say what?  None of the characters are likable, and the tale is ever so slow to unravel.  Although this book was on the list of best summer beach reads, it should be buried in the sand."
"If you liked Gone Girl, you would like this book. It's kind of slow, but the last 100 pages, it finally picks up. Definitely didn't predict the end. The whole book was just you waiting for Rachel to get her memory back. It was an okay book. A nice read if you're bored and trying to pass the time."
"Cool story. I started reading it because I watched the trailer to the movie. The books are always better than the movies.I struggled with the first few chapters, but once you get used to the writing style of the author it gets easier.Quick blunt ending, a little bit predictable. Good book."
"Well done. Among other things, explores the theme of whether we can ever really know who another person is. I see a lot of Gaslight in this too, skillfully limned in the last chapters as Rachel comes into awareness of herself, what she witnessed the Saturday night when Megan disappeared, what Tom did to her, and finds the strength and resolve to discover the truth and trust herself."
"It was a good enough read to get through quickly, but I felt deflated at the end. It was all about affairs, promiscuity and alcoholism (and murder, of course). There were no likable characters here; even the cops were sleazy. It wasn't clear why Rachel lied so incessantly; it was unnecessary and only got her into more trouble. It just added to her already deeply flawed and unsympathetic character. And at the end, after the trauma she goes through, she miraculously sobers up. Seems like the opposite was more likely. The way it was written, with the back and forth first-person narratives, seemed a bit amateurish.The story was pretty good, and  some character development does occur. But I don't think it comes close to Gone Girl, as some of the reviewers have compared it to"
"I enjoyed the device that conveyed multiple perspectives out of chronological order.  The ""mystery"" if one was intended, was too transparent.  But the psychology of the three main women was interesting and kept me reading."
"I was a little unsure when I first started reading the book - a totally different style than I'm used to reading but was recommended the book after reading Gone Girl.  As i got through the first couple chapters, I was hooked and couldn't put it down!"
Psychological thrillers can become cringy after a certain point but this one is particularly engaging in the sense that the narration by all the three ladies was unique and powerful. Some moments were quite viscerial to say the least
"A mystery of a jilted married woman and her x-husband. Hard to read at first but, I was glad I continued. A man capable of many things worse than  cheating on his wife. Rachel soon discovers why she is like she is. And another man driven to the point of insanity. I could barely put it down."
"The ""payoff"" ending was rather lame.  The writing was good, but as a male, it was excruciating being inside the minds of 3 three women that were extremely uninteresting, needy and weak.  It took me a while to guess the ending, as this author keeps it pretty well hidden.  But the ending was about as exciting and clever as a Lifetime movie.  I'm surprised at all the glowing reviews, but what do you expect from a society that thinks The Big Bang Theory is gut splitting."
"If you (like me) are someone who always prefers the book to the movie, buy and read this book now, as it will inevitably be made into a film! From page one, I was drawn into this novel. The suspense builds quickly, and is sustained throughout the entire book. My book club LOVED this selection, and can't wait to read more by this author."
"Very depressing book with women portrayed as helpless and needy throughout most of the book.  I rarely stop reading a book that I've started but I would have stopped reading this one were I not reading it for a book club.  Since the author is a woman, I sure hope that her next book portrays women in a better light!"
I read the reviews before I bought this book and was concerned that this would be a rip off of gone girl.  I'm glad I read it because it was most definitely not.  I honestly don't see any similarity except the fact that there both written in diary format.  Bram Stokers 'Dracula' was also written in diary style as well.  It is an old technique used in mystery's and one I enjoy frankly.  This book is an enjoyable mystery with a brilliant insight into emotions an alcoholism that make it seem that it must be based on a true story.  It takes a little getting used to the characters in the beginning.  After that it's a real page turner.  Not as crude as GG which my old fashioned blood appreciated.
"It's kind of a mystery, but no thriller.  The main character, Rachel, is so annoying, hapless and helpless, that one is hard-pressed to continue reading. If you forge ahead, however, you get to the abrupt end after twisting, turning and following leads (like the mysterious red-headed man) that go nowhere. In the end, you just don't care anyway and heave a sigh of tefief that it is over,"
"I love suspense and this book gives it all. I'm the type of person who likes to guess the endings of books. I like a challenge and this book had me guessing up and down and all over the place.  The only thing I would say that it drags a little at the beginning, but hey what book doesn't?"
"Books do not come any better than Girl on the Train. The plotting, the pacing, the characters, all of it, flawless. I was hooked from page one, read it practically in one sitting, and I see why so many people love it. Like Stephen King said, Hawkins nails that alcoholic narrator and uses the device to perfection. GOTT, like Gone Girl before it, is a perfect blend of literary and popcorn thriller. Simply put: a masterpiece."
"Some of the best stories ever told, begin with something most people might have done and then continue to ""what if.."". Paula Hawkins certainly took this to the edge of what could happen, with enough quirky twists and characters to keep me turning pages right up to the unexpected ending. The secrets kept until the end made for good suspense. It's dark sometimes, but so is life."
"You know this is an excellent read if you are only less than halfway through this book, and you are at work, shopping, whatever, meanwhile,in your mind, trying to anticipate what happens next in this alluring, addictive novel."
"I enjoyed how it was written from several different p.o.v. but got it confusing with all the dates (at least for me, I only read a could chapters a night before bed). Once I could dedicate several hours to reading it was easier to keep track of. And kept you guessing who was at fault."
"My book club all agreed that the book was well written for a first novel.  The suspense was there, and I think finally being able to determine the murderer in the last few pages was a plus as the reader waited to see just what would become of that character along with possible victims. We also agreed that the author had done a fine job of making us ""not"" like any of the characters.  In this book, that was a good thing."
"With a slow start, the book picked up toward the middle and became suspenseful at the end. The flashbacks were helpful in learning the backstories of the characters and allowing you to understand their motivations for there actions. I would recommend the book as it held my interest throughout and was an entertaining read."
I didn't expect this book to be so dysfunctional after reading the book jacket & customer reviews. I found it difficult to stay with it & actually stopped reading it for a while.  Every character had some new form of dysfunction which became very old very soon.
"The Girl on the Train is a novel that keeps your attention throughout- you are always questioning, ""Who did it?"". I am not a huge fan of the end... thought it wrapped up the mystery too quickly and was a bit to blunt in comparison to the drawn out plot. But, I couldn't put it down and enjoyed the element of suspense, and the multiple perspectives the story is told from."
"I bought this book to read because the movie trailer look intriguing. I could not put it down!  Every time I thought I had it figured out, there was a twist I didn't see coming. Very quick read or just seemed that way because you can't stop reading...every ""chapter"" is the good part!"
"I enjoyed the book. I read it in two days, so it moved right along. I did figure out what was happening a few chapters before the ending. But still, it was well written and had good insight in how the main character battled her demons. The authors' language in the book reminded me of a time gone by. It's a good read, try it."
"Started good, hard to follow at times, got slow in the middle,but more exciting towards the end.  I expected it to be a lot more attention getting but it wasn't for me.  Interested in seeing the movie now out of curiosity."
Mediocre. I read this out of curiosity and was highly disappointed. Yes it'seems similar to Gone Girl in the sense that it's a mystery story and all the characters are terrible  people but the similarities end there. Not remotely as exciting.
"The book starts out slow, sometimes painfully slow, going through the main character's thoughts & struggle with alcoholism. The book is reminiscent of Gone Girl, only Gone Girl wasn't as slow; it was also more twisted than this book. Overall a decent one time read."
"I give this book 5 stars for being a very well crafted mystery but much less than that for the characters. The 3 lead women are all pathetic victims who are virtually nothing ( in their own minds) without their men. The 3 lead men are all sinister and untrustworthy, two of them extremely violent.Nothing complex about any of them and I found myself irritated by the stereotypes.I would not recommend this story that I bought for it's Goodreads honors."
"This was a quick read, but super cheesy; the last 2/3's of the book reminded me of a lame horror film.The characters were uninteresting and too similar. The plot was was extremely far-fetched. Most of the mystery surrounding the story pertained to Rachel's profound drunkeness and lack of memory of key events as a result. Then at the end of the book she suddenly remembers. How unreal that almost every character in the story had an affair/pregnancy with each other. I could go on, but the most unrealistic event occurs when Tom gets up with the baby when the monitor goes off so Anna can sleep. What man does that?! Two Stars"
Marilyn T EdwardsAmazon recommended this book.What a thriller! I was doubly pleased that I couldn't second guess the author.I will recommend it to all my friends and familyI don't belong to a book club but they do.
I can say I found the plot of this book unusual and interesting - sort of. I didn't really like the narrative and was bored sometimes. The main character was not likable at all. I didn't believe the secundary characters - they seemed fake. I didn't expect the ending but I didn't believe it either. I was entertained. Not the best I've read.
Worst book ever. Every single page ... this Rachel character it was like reading the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over ...... and over again about how drunk she is and how drunk she wants to be how she can't remember anything . Just no! Save yourself the misery. Took me a month to finish because I was annoyed.
"This book has been recommended by so many sources as ""the book to read this summer."" And was compared favorably to ""Gone Girl."" In the spirit of comparisons, this is a far better book than ""Gone Girl."" It certainly has a much more satisfying ending, but similiarly, both books involve the dark side of human nature. Rachel's narrative is so pathetically alcoholic that you want a full glass of cold water and an aspirin to alleviate your aching head. It is a page turner, and a quick read. And most happily, there are characters here who are flawed, but deserving of sympathy (unlike the utter contempt I felt for all in GG)."
"Loved this book, even though the main character is pretty messed up. She's an alcoholic trying to deal with a divorce and the loss of her job. Now she is riding the train everyday to a job she no longer has, passing her old home in which her ex and his new wife and baby live. To make matters worse she has begun to fantasize about the young couple two doors down. Things really get tangled when the wife of the young couple disappears. 's. Hawkins keeps you guessing till the end about how all these people connect."
A novel where the author did an outstanding job making every single one of the characters not only flawed but universally unlikable. I enjoyed the authors style and they do a good job at setting up a whodunit they might keep you guessing until the end.
I was hesitant to order this book - the title didn't do anything for me. then I saw it was number one on the New York best sellers list so I tried it. I really enjoyed it and had very mixed feelings regarding the characters and their stories. I like the way it ended and that was a surprise. I was intrigued by the authors look into others' lives as the train passed their living space. I loved looking in windows as I passed peoples houses as a kid while a passenger in a car. It was interesting to imagine what their lives were like and I loved the imagination of Paula's couple  that could be seen from the train window.I also liked that the protagonist was a sloppy drunk that I both felt sorry for and was disgusted by.
It is a good book- switches from three different women's perspective. I thought some parts dragged on a bit and could have been cut short but over all a great read. It keeps you guessing until the end. I would recommend reading it.
Might be me but the beginning of this book was really confusing.  I had to go back and forth just to keep up with who was talking in some chapters.  I did finish it but it was not what I was expecting.  Maybe the movie was better.  I did finish and the ending was surprising but left me disappointed.
"Such a great read!  I am so glad I read the book before seeing the movie.  I have seen the comparisons to gone girl, and the only similarity I can discern is that of an enthralling read that will keep you guessing.  I LOVED IT!"
"This is a great book for mystery lovers. It starts a bit slowly, but as the story goes on the pace picks up as will your heart rate until the riveting end. I gave it 5 stars because I couldn't put it down as the story intensified."
"This book has no redeeming qualities. It's premise is silly and sophomoric. To have others call it ""Hitchcockian"" is insulting. Every character in the book is devoid of any thing approaching humanity. From the main characters to the secondary, from the good guys to the bad guys they are alike in that they are all  weak, whiny, disreputable and without any morals or ethics and so boorishly depicted that you simply cannot care about anyone in the story. You quite simply can only hope for a virus to come along early in the story and wipe out everyone involved. The virus would be more interesting and have more ""humanity"" than the people in this novel. If they make this into a movie I hope they add Ebola so I have someone to root for."
"This book was a quick read--the pacing reminded me of time passing on a train (which I believe was the author's intent!) I enjoyed the narrative devices employed, that the book was not predictable, and that the characters had depth even though the reader only gets small snippets at a time. I'd recommend this as a fun vacation book or a good ""in-between book"" (which I'm always looking for after finishing longer, more literary books)."
I enjoyed this book a lot. Was just a little confusing in the beginning keeping dates & people straight. Rachel was such a good character & her dealing with her addiction & loss of her marriage was heartbreaking. Anna was not nice but I wouldn't be either if my husband's ex kept calling him.
"A decent read, especially if you're on your commute! But won't and shouldn't win any 'literature' prizes. Poor: Characters are one-dimensional, even the most complex character who's an alcoholic. I didn't care about any of them. All the men seem to be angry, aggressive, slightly unbalanced types. Some cliched writing in places. Good: Structure of the book is novel and leads to a nice flow and page-turning quality."
"This story begins with the reader feeling sorry for and a little put off by Rachel's drunkenness.  Megan and Anna seem to be more admirable characters.  But as the story progresses, Rachel becomes the strong character while the true natures of Megan and Anna are revealed.  All three women have definite flaws, but the male characters are even more flawed.  The author has woven them together into a thriller which was hard to put down."
I read this book in less than a day. From beginning to end I was captivated by all the twists and turns. Ms. Hawkins is an incredible writer. Each character is so complicated that you want to reach out and smack some sense into them. But as the story reveals more about each character you see their human frailties. The story kept me at the edge of my seat. Fabulous read. I give it a 4 star.
"Great book, though I hate stories will Verbal and physical abuse in them .The main character, Rachel,  is one screwed up chick who keeps going back for more.Mark my words this will end up on the big screen with Tom Cruise being the ex husband and  Shalene Woodly as one of the wives.The book started off great, got a little slow in the middle and then rocketed at the end.I did not see the end coming as it did."
"I liked the fact that the characters were all very human. Each flawed & imperfect. It made all of them sympathetic. The story moved along at a comfortable pace, neither rushed nor too slow. I enjoy a good ""murder mystery,"" but there was beauty in the telling of the story as well. I especially loved how the author used the trains to create a feeling & set the tone and rhythm. And she accomplished all of this while managing to be unique. Very enjoyable."
"I really enjoyed this book. The narrator is totally unreliable which keeps you guessing and trying to figure out her real story.  You know the whole time you're reading it that there must be something more to what you know so far.  Keep reading, it's a good one!"
"This book was a page-turner for me.  It's a bit in the genre of Gone Girl in that the main character is not all together likable, but you'll want to keep reading to find out what really happened vs. what she thinks may have happened.  I was a bit disappointed in that I had figured out who the ""bad guy"" was before it was revealed.  Don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read it, so I'll just say, add it to your reading list."
My daughter read this book and kept telling me to read it. I finally did read the book. Great book with lots of twists and turns. I always felt anxious while reading because I never could figure out what Rachel was going to do next.  Now I need to go see the movie. Happy Reading!
"So depressing. I don't get all the 5 star reviews. I have tried to get through this book 3 times, finally did after a year. It's the most depressing book I've read in a long time.  The characters are boring, have boring lives, run around and complain and moan about how horrible everything is.  How is this a 5 star book?"
It was not as good as I thought it would be.  The story just dragged on with this drunken woman trying to piece things together.  I finally found out who the killer was at the very end.  I would not recommend it.
"One of the better ""whodunits"" I've read in recent years.  The economic and social strictures of post-Thatcherian suburbia set the background for this surprisingly powerful novel about a ""girl"" (unemployed) on a ""train"" (daily commuter run) who has little better to do than shuttle back and forth from home to London -- and muse about the life she wished she'd had.  Not fast, but compelling.  The characters are not chock-full of surprises until the very end of the novel, but they are moved along well enough by author Paula Hawkins. Narration and dialog are British, of course, but not so tough as to move us Yanks to the urbandictionary more often than occasionally.If, indeed, you liked the book/movie GONE GIRL you will probably like this one too."
"This book was recommended by a friend after I indicated that I was really enjoyed the book Gone Girl which kept me up until the wee hours of the morning to find out what happened next.  The first half of the book moves along a little slowly, setting up the intrigue in the second part of the book.  Although it kept interested enough to want to finish the book, I found that it plodded along at times and the ending wasn't a page turner."
"Great messy characters and interesting narration style.  The main character made me uncomfortable at times and I wanted to shake her at others, which means the author did a bang up job of attaching me to her flawed heroine.  I read this in 3 days, only because I had to eat, shower and work.  Loved the twists and turns and the thought process of imagining the lives of people we see as if they are characters in our story rather than theirs."
Great murder mystery written in the first person through the eyes of multiple characters. A little confusing at the beginning as perspectives and dates are not in chronological order so reader must pay attention to who's talking and the time sequence in which stories are being recounted. All in all a very exciting novel. Kept me up late reading it....couldn't put it down.
"This is a smart, suspenseful book. It reads quickly, mostly because you won't want to put it down. I'm glad I read the book before watching the movie. I also thought the relationships and priorities of the women in the book were very interesting...a bit like a social critique."
This book grabbed my attention from the first page and kept it until the last!  Sometimes when there are alternating persons telling the story it can get confusing but that was not the case with this book.  I was hoping for an easy read that kept my attention and that is exactly what I got.  I highly recommend this book.
"The book was easy to get into and was captivating right away.  About midway through I found it a little overwhelming that people abuse themselves by drinking so much, making so many poor uneducated choices and are actually wandering on the streets.  Even though this was ""fiction"" my take on it is that anyone could find a woman such as this in any city in the US.  It is really sad."
"The book was slow until I was almost 80% of the way through with it. But when you get to that point, you realize that the story has been building to that moment from very early on. It's enjoyable but make sure you take the time to read it to the end and don't give up on it. It's worth it."
"I read this book while on my iPad while I walked on the treadmill. About day 3 into this book, I couldn't stop walking! I also couldn't wait for my date with my book - and treadmill - the next day. I enjoyed the writing, I loved Rachel's dialogue, and I had trouble putting the book down. I would recommend to anyone! My only disclaimer would be that it would be hard to read if you are struggling with infertility."
"A treatise on one of the variables of domestic abuse.  I have seen firsthand how the psychological abuse can make even the best and brightest women think they are at fault, and how they don't tell friends or family of both psychological and physical abuse until it is too late."
"I liked it a lot, but it was not great. I do recommend it. A few red herrings, especially the red headed guy she ran into a few times. About 1/2 way in, I figured out who the murderer was. About 2/3 of the way I was convinced I was correct, which I was, and read it to completion with that solution in mind. Took a little too long to tell the story, but I liked the way she resolved various situations such as the psychiatrist's kiss as seen from the train. Done right, it would make a good movie."
"This novel satisfied my need for something just a little different than the norm. The heroine was  not some little perfect beauty with vanity/dating issues, who somehow has expert detective skills which helps the attractive bachelor detective in the solving of a murder case. The perfect couple then somehow falls in love as they dodge bullets and plan the perfect garden wedding only weeks after landing their perps and dissolving a crime ring. No, this was totally different, and I loved it. It was steady paced and a  screen swiper( instead of a page turner)."
"Beware, before you know it you will be sucked into this story and won't be released until you read the last page. Even then, you'll be thinking of the story long after reading the last page. In the beginning, it was a little difficult to determine just who was narrating and about whom but the writing was such that you kept going. I would imagine most people who ride a train or bus that stops routinely, fantasize about the people they see or who lives in the homes they pass. This story takes that premise one step further when one of the people disappears. The prose is easy to read, descriptive with good character development and the plot twists and turns may give you whiplash. The Girl on the Train is a really good read."
"I don't recommend reading this book if you are down in the dumps or even slightly depressed.  I thought it would be a good book to read from the description given.  It sounded so good that I purchased it outright without trying a sample which was a big mistake. I even purchased an audio of it for my husband for Valentine's Day.  Fortunately,I downloaded the book to my Kindle and read it before he opened the audio.  I told him that I would exchange it for something else because I know that he wouldn't enjoy listening to that audio.  I kept reading thinking that it would get better which never happened. The happy ending for me was when I finished the book. I have been criticized in the past for giving my true opinion.  I never have finished Gone Girl and it is suppose to be good!"
"I belong to an excellent book club, but I was totally disappointed by this club selection. Talk about vapid, weak characters! I was not alone in my negative opinion of this book. Our book club discussion ended with the members wondering why this book had won awards. Frankly, it was hard to care about any of the characters or about anything that happened in the story."
"I was a little confused at the start of this book, but once all the characters were introduced, I was off and running.  I got to a point, where it was hard to put this book down.  There are some surprises, which I didn't see coming, kept me wanting more.  I would recommend this book to your readers as a ""GOOD READ""John Ali"
"Kept in suspense throughout. Lots of twists and turns throughout the plot. Wonderful story telling. The crime as seen through the eyes of the victim and the other prominent women and their perspectives on the crime. Wonderful ""whodunit""."
This was an exceptionally well crafted book.  The format of the story line was quite unique and entertaining as it went back and forth between the principal characters.  Ms. Hawkins demonstrated her great talent and this was a phenomenal effort for a first time writer.  It deserved to be on the Best Sellers list.  Other people also valued the quality of this book.  I did kept switching my POV about who the guilty party was until near the end when I picked out the most likely character.  I suspect the author had a hand in this...not just my detective skills.  Ms. Hawkins fed me clues just when she wanted to do so.  I highly recommend this book.  In fact I already have to a friend.
"After seeing someone reading this on a plane, decided to give it a try.  Confused writing, confused characters, way over developed details leading very slowly to an attempted twist ending.  It feels like a first attempt at writing edited by teachers that want to encourage a young writer without hurting their feelings.Hopefully others will not waste their money or time on this dull story."
I had a little trouble getting into this story largely because of the style of telling the story of several characters in the first person and shifting the time of the telling. I kept having to go back to the previous chapters to see what the date was of that part of the story to keep the flow of events in my mind. About half way through the book I was captured by the plot that at first seemed to be too much in the head but then picked up as the plot unfolded and the suspense peaked. The ending was a twist to what I had expected so that is always a fun discovery.
"This story is narrated from the viewpoint of three women. The author jumps between them and time frames sliding from the current time to past. I found it rather cumbersome but, at the insistence of my daughter, I kept reading. It did get better around the middle of the book. Unfortunately, by then I had a really good idea who caused all the havoc."
"Loved this book! Lots of tension and a good story.  I have to admit that I did figure out ""who done it"" at about 70% of the way through but so did most people, I'm sure.Really creepy and suspenseful. Poor Rachel was just such a mess, I got so frustrated with her and her drinking and her self-pity. Lots of characters to despise in this book - but that is part of what makes it so much fun.Highly recommend."
"This starts out with great character development and builds a story that keeps shifting and turning until the final pages.  It's hard to put down once you start reading.  Hawkins makes her characters real and fallible and even slightly un-appealing - even her main story teller.  But the reader never loses interest - there is always something that urges him/her on to the next page, the next chapter."
"Unreadable, don't buy it."
This books delves deeply into the thoughts and actions of intimate relationships and a resulting murder. It is definitely an edge of your seat thriller.
"If this is a best seller I will be,very cautious to read another highly rated book. I found so much lacking in the continuity of the plot. I did not get involved with the characters, fortunately, because the author moved too quickly. I value my reading time highly and felt this was a waste."
An amazing suspense novel that leaves you on the edge of your seat. You might think you know what happened but you are shocked to find out the truth. The author develops the characters in such a way that keeps the book interesting and wanting to keep turning the page. Loved it and cannot wait for the movie!
"This story grips you from the beginning and leaves the reader thirsty for more.  The main character is not very sympathetic in the beginning and has her share of issues, but by the end you see her gaining her footing and start to trust herself, so you in turn gain more confidence in her as you read.  I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone who likes a suspenseful read full of mystery and excitement."
"I am not a big fan of fiction, but this book is incredible. The narrative is absolutely captivating, and I can't wait to read her next book. Me."
"I usually don't read a book in two days, but I found this book easy to read, and compelling. I particularly enjoyed the author's writing style of short chapters written in the first person. Getting into Rachel's head (the main character with lots of issues) made it a great read."
"Four stars because The Girl on the Train held my interest and was well-written, but it could have been five stars if there was just one character that I cared about.  This book was populated with miserable people, one more miserable than the next.  In the beginning I was hoping that Rachel, the main character would become less pathetic as the story evolved, but she didn't, and by the end I just didn't care.  So maybe, four stars is a stretch.  If you are looking for a book to uplift you for just one moment, keep on looking."
I really enjoyed the book! I decided to buy it to read on the plane on my way to Asia. I liked it! I almost left it behind because it was weighing my backpack down (LOL)! I actually enjoyed the story narration and it had a huge twist to it! It's not s***ty like Twilight and 50 shades (even though I read and loved all those books). It was eerie and kept me wondering what in the HECK is going on.I read online that there might be a movie in the works! We shall see if and how it will turn out! I like to read books before the movies come out to see the difference. I don't believe it will disappoint!
"Best book I have read lately. My daughter read it and told me to get it. I was confused with all the characters in the beginning, but never expected who the killer was. Now there is a movie coming out 10/2 and Emily Blunt is the star, don't think you will be disappointed."
"Excellent novel. I haven't read fiction in some years, but this was a good book to get back in the swing of things. I found myself intrigued by every detail of every character, consistently trying to piece this mystery together. I was left completely satisfied from beginning to end. As I read the book, I couldnt help but think of Gone Girl (the movie) and then I find out this will become a movie, leaves me excited to see what Hollywood does with it!. Good read, not too short, and not too long."
"Long, dragged out, and boring. I read this book because of all the hype surrounding it. I don't get the stellar reviews, this book was awful. None of the characters are likable, information is included in the book that added zero value to the story. Basically you spend the whole time waiting for an annoying drunk to get her memory back then the book quickly wraps up. Every main female character in this book was deplorable and it took everything in me to muster some kind of like or understanding for them. In real life these are people you hope to never come across."
The book was a solid read however it took me a month to read it as some parts of it was very slow paced. I thought the ending could have been more thought out. It really seemed rushed and that the author got lazy. Overall solid book. I would recommended it to others. I'm hoping the movie will be better.
Better written than many mainstream murder mystery novels. However I did have the end figured out by about the middle of the book. Some situations were a little implausible (the widower allowing her to get close is pretty unlikely). This book did keep my interest until the end and overall was an enjoyable read.
"Oddly, I found this novel hard to get into. I didn't relate to the main character Rachel and I found her weak.  It seemed like it would be a depressing choice, but slowly, like a train that starts off slowly but gradually build speed, I found myself drawn into the storyline. The author did a good job of explaining the relationship between the characters and the lines became less blurred. About quarter way into the novel, I finally got all of the characters straight.  I ended up enjoying the book very much and think it would make a great movie. Of course, some parts were pretty unbelievable to me.............some of the therapist's actions, Rachel going back to the old house so many times) but they added to the mystery.  It was suspenseful and satisfying."
"Overall, it was a good read. Just like a large majority, it was difficult to get into. However, it did get much better. I mostly continued reading to see the differences in the book compared to the future motion picture. In the end, I would recommend this book to a friend, but it's definitely not the next ""Gone Girl."""
"I was generally disappointed in this book given all the hype and five-star reviews. While similar to Gone Girl, it was not as rich in character development. I found it difficulty to care about the fate of any of the main characters.  I suspected ""the twist""about halfway through. Normally, this would not have been a problem had the writing and characters been more compelling. Still, it's probably a matter of taste."
"I wanted to like this book because so many others seem to love it, but I'm disappointed.  The first half is so heartbreakingly depressing that I almost gave up.  Just then I figured it all out and kept reading to confirm I was right--I was, fairly obvious.  I must also thank the author for introducing me the clunkiest word in the English language--quieten.  It must be an actual word, but it should never be used, and sadly, it appears over and over and over again.  There's definite talent here, so I've no doubt that future books will be better, and there's a good chance I'll read them.  Might I suggest Tana French's brilliant The Secret Place instead?"
"Good read. Only took me 2 days to finish so it was definitely a page turner. The middle of the book was somewhat slow and repetitive leading up to the climax. By that point, the ending became predictable. But overall, it wasn't bad and I look forward to seeing the movie."
"This suspenseful book is great ! It keeps you staying up late to read this page turner! If you loved Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl or Dark Places, you will love this read! It is worth the read even with all the hype surrounding it. Enjoy your next read!"
This psychological thriller is a page turner! The author does a great job developing all the characters with depth. Pay attention to the dates. All the characters are flawed and multifaceted which  makes any of them a suspect in this murder mystery!  Can't wait to see the movie!
"I must admit I never even got to the murder.  I found her obsession tedious, though I realize it made the plot possible, because what healthy person would invest themselves in this couple's pretend life?  Also, I found it ridiculous that she would be allowed to take care of that child.  I have to like the protagonist to read a book.  Yes, it limits my exposure to literature, but I have enough negative personalities to deal with in REAL LIFE.  I don't need to have to manage them in fiction.  There's got to be one central, sane person in the literature I read.  I could find no one in the little I read.  She reminded me of Cheryl Strayed (Wild).  Get to a REAL doctor who can help you heal and start living a decent life! Sheesh!"
"I got so annoyed with the main character, her stupidity at times was SO annoying - I continued to read this book more out of curiosity. I did want to know what happened.  So the author did capture that for me. I didn't have any attachment to the main character and am unsure what the author was hoping to portray with this quirky, insecure, girl, whom you wished to shake at times - though I guess I've answered myself - it generated a reaction.Its a readable book, but not what I expected from this author."
"I am a published author, a voracious reader and I say The Girl on the Train is one of the best novels I have read in recent years. The story itself is a unique and daring story, but it is what  this author does with that story that makes this book stand high above most writers. Planning to read a couple of chapters and then return to my own writing, I literally could not stop reading. That's rare for me. I'm able to put any book down.The author writes us into a relationship with each character, whom we feel we know, especially Rachel.An amazing novel. An amazing writer. An amazing literary career ahead!Joyce NormanAuthor"
"I loved that the book was written with alternating persons/points of views. I found the characters to be very relatable, which got my attention and kept it. The twisting plot and unveiled secrets kept my attention and I finished the book very quickly. Great read."
"This was a good book that took an unexpected turn at the end that I never saw coming.  That's always fun!  It was interesting because the book was written from the point of view of three different women at different times, until it all came together at the end.  I couldn't wait to spend a half hour to an hour at the end of the day to curl up with it and find out what these three women were up to.  At the end it left me with a wonderful feeling of satisfaction!"
"I haven't read a book like this in a while, but once I started I couldn't put it down.  The whole set up of the book keeps you very intrigued and constantly guessing.  I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great read!"
An amazing suspense novel that leaves you on the edge of your seat. You might think you know what happened but you are shocked to find out the truth. The author develops the characters in such a way that keeps the book interesting and wanting to keep turning the page. Loved it and cannot wait for the movie!
"I'm not really sure how I feel about this book. I felt compelled to finish it because I wanted the whole story. The way it was written reminded me of ""Gone Girl"" switching from several character perspectives. The overall storyline was intriguing but I just didn't find any of the characters to be relatable. The main character, Rachel, is drawn into this complete stranger's disappearance and life so obsessively that I was almost ashamed for her throughout the whole story. There were real life struggles with alcoholism and domestic affairs and disputes, but the way Rachel came across was ridiculously clingy and annoying to me. I almost gave the book 3 stars, but decided on 2 because it's not really something I would recommend."
"Page turner...I could not put it down!  Kept me guessing and intrigued to the very end.  I love flawed characters with a bit of ""the twisted"" in them.  I have recommended this one to all my avid reader friends.  The title character is, in some respects, just a pitiful mess.  Not exactly someone you want to care about, but keep on with because it is like watching a train wreck (no pun intended)...you just can't look away.  With few redeeming qualities, she sets herself on a trajectory of a constant downward spiral and yet there is something about her that makes you believe she is worthy of being redeemed.  I won't give away plot details - you can read those anywhere.  I will just say that once on board, you will want to ride to the end of this intriguing read."
"Wanted to read this before the movie came out.  Was not disappointed.  The author keeps the plot moving forward and keeps the reader in suspense, though was beginning to see ""whodunit"" towards the end.  Good read."
"Enthralling thriller ala Hitchcock. Told in first person narrative, alternating chapters, by the three main female characters.  No simple task but done to perfection, revealing all, and nothing, at the same time.  Filled with twists and turns while giving nothing away.Read in two sittings, only from necessity of sleep and job."
"I didn't dislike the book, but I was definitely able to put it down. For me, it lacked suspense. And it took me a long time to get the women's perspectives and timelines straight. Hoping the movie adaptation it better."
"This book is pretty much on target for a classic movie, I would compare it to some of my all time favorites, Cape Fear, Gone Girl. I would suggest reading by anyone that gets into a good book, and can't put it down. That's the kind of book this is."
"I really wanted to find a character that I could associate myself with, but could not find one.  Portrayal of the dark days of binge drinking was handled well in the story.  Viewing facial expressions in the upcoming movie may turn this into 5 stars."
"This is a book that I should have read as a book and not on my Kindle. It was difficult to remember all the characters and not easy to go back and find them. Since each main character has their own chapters, I lost track of who was who. The book would have given the names in that chapter at the top of each page."
"Captivating. I couldn't put it down. It's an easy read but really gets your brain thinking, not only about the plot, but the characters and what they are going through. It opens your eyes to real struggles going on today that are often hidden as you drive by someone."
"Story is slow at first and a little confusing, but then becomes clear after several pages. It is interesting and sad and a mystery that is solved by a woman who is an alcoholic with accompanying blackouts.She has trials that seem to be insurmountable but has more strength than she ever thought she did. Unique story line, surprisingly powerful lead character, wonderful book. I loved it."
"Very good. Sucked me in right away. One of those can't put down, just one more chapters, and then suddenly it's 3 am, type of books. I read reviews before purchasing that the characters weren't very likeable. I didn't have any issues with who the characters were. If they were totally normal women, the book wouldn't of been what it was for me. The characters made this book. Loved it. Can't wait for another one from Paula Hawkins!"
"When I first started reading this book I almost put it aside labeling it another one of those psycho dramas. However, I  picked it back up ""just to see"" where it might be going. An episode in life through the eyes and consciouness or unconsciousness, of an alcoholic in a desperate situation, just with her alcoholism alone, increases in its intensity and intrigue. Finally I could not put the book down."
Might be me but the beginning of this book was really confusing.  I had to go back and forth just to keep up with who was talking in some chapters.  I did finish it but it was not what I was expecting.  Maybe the movie was better.  I did finish and the ending was surprising but left me disappointed.
"Hated it!  Comparison to Hitchcock is insulting.  If you like drunks that black out again and again and AGAIN and guess what ""I can't remember"", taking forever to get a story told, this book is for you.  It took patience to get to the end because it was the same thing over and over and anyone could guess the end.  Kept on reading waiting for this book to stand up to the reviews-it didn't.."
"Read it in 48 hours... The first book in months where I could not put it down. I love how it encases the lives of three women and how their stories intertwine. It's a must-read, page turner - a book I would definitely recommend. It's been awhile since I've read a wonderful book like this, and it reminded me of my love for reading, once again."
"Nice to read,  you can not let it go until you finish it. But too much violence, verbal physical, it is very sad. I give only 4 stars, because when I finished I was expecting more, and I do not miss any character, it is like I would like to forget I read this book at all."
"I gave this book a try and it was fabulous! It is about a girl that takes the train every day and imagines the lives of the people in the houses that she sees. Sounds weird and it starts out kind of strange, but then you really want to know what the heck happened. She also tells the story from three different POV, which is a formula I really like. It’s been on the bestseller list for a while and I’m so glad I finally read it!"
Gripping and Intriguing. Very well written! There will def be a movie is there isn't one in the works already!
I enjoyed this book... I feel  thoughts and feelings of the 3 women were thorough.  I'm wondering how the movie will convey all these thoughts for someone who has not already read the book?  I found myself thinking about the book characters when I was away from the book for several hours or a couple days...
"The entire story led up the ending and everything made sense.  Beautifully written, you felt that you could relate to each character.  I could see the entire book come to life in my mind by the amazing descriptive sentences of  this book.  I cannot wait for another book by Paula Hawkins!"
I actually loved everything about this book. I loved that it dipped in and out along the timeline. I liked the differing character views. The story was gripping and compelling and it really did keep you guessing until the end. I would absolutely recommend this book!
"After reading reviews of this book, I could hardly wait to get started on it. I must say I expected something in the league with GONE GIRL. I found it a fairly entertaining mystery but am not going around recommending it to fellow readers. I'm a stickler for determining why each character is in the book; as a result, the redheaded man seemed to serve little or no purpose except perhaps to make the reader consider him as a possible suspect."
"This is a thinking person's tale: questioning motives, weighing decisions and looking for avenues that reconcile the past with the present. Although I found some of the twists and turns tedious in spots, it is still a well-told story with great potential for longevity."
"This was a fascinating read. Rachel used her imagination to occupy her mind when she was on the train.  The characters living in the  the homes along the track soon would become people she would know and interact with. Rachel who was presented as a pitiful character whom others disliked would be a heroine,."
"I just finished reading this book as I savored it over several weeks.  Because each chapter alternates between characters, I sometimes found myself going back to the start of the chapter to remind myself which character it was I was reading about.I enjoyed how all the characters tied together as well as the outcome, which was not what I was expecting.  I really enjoyed the read!"
"This book seemed longish to me, but I still couldn't put it down.  The surprise ending got me.  Nice to have a story where the main character seems to be a complete washout and then comes out on top in the end. The descriptions of her alcoholism and its progression are spot on and very accurate and relatable. I recommend this book to anyone loving a good mystery, as well as an engaging human story."
"Well, it is ok, just that. I thought it was going to be like Gone Girl, but no. The plot is good, but the pace is so slow, almost boring at the beginning of the story, well, almost the whole book. Now, I hope the movie to be better than the book, which I doubt."
Twists and turns kept me guessing.  Ms Hawkins weaves this tale amongst the everyday lives of suburbanites. Thoroughly enjoyed.  Just learned today that the movie will be out in October
"No spoilers - but this is a writerly sort of book, with three questionable narrators, with three subplots told from three different points of view, and once you start reading, you will keep reading until you can finally answer the question: who killed Megan?  After you finish reading, this novel will keep you thinking about the lies we tell each other - and ourselves."
Very well written. Similar in feeling to Gone Girl as I was reading it.
"Begins a little slow, but soon becomes hypnotic and addictive. Usually, in crime novels you can see the perpetrator a mile away, but this book actually surprised me. Author builds the suspense and drops clues flawlessly."
"This is a brilliantly written thriller. I strongly recommend this book. Rachel is a very believable, interesting, and deep character."
"The writing did keep me reading. Ultimately though, this turned into a predictable and rather dull story. Robert Gailbraith is 100 times over a better mystery/thriller author. I'm glad I read it however, for else I always would have wondered if I was missing out on something."
"For several I had a difficult time reading about characters imagining things, making stories up, and then finally getting into the characters.  I did not the story being chopped up into different tales.  After finally knitting the story altogether I could not put the book aside.  Glorious, unexpected ending."
Saw this was a best seller.  So I was drawn in.  Just shows what marketing and New York Times can do.  Characters were all pathetic.
"Do they not realize I have to stop reading and sleep a few hour? This is how good this book is. A total page turner, edge of your seat, hating putting it down and can't wait to pick it back up. Especially, the last 50-60 pages. AMAZING!Highly recommend."
"This book kept me in suspense and I hated to put it down.  I enjoyed it very much.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  If I had to find any fault with this novel, I guess the fact that none of the main characters had outstanding moral fiber.  All three were somewhat flawed.  But aren't we all, or at least most of us , to some extent.  I liked the book because it was suspenseful, fast paced. and had a decent ending."
"A decent murder mystery book, but I've read better. The development of the characters were alright. I thought that the author forced the main chapter to do certain things that were just unrealistic and odd to get to the proper ending. It was a page turner and I didn't realize that I wasnt a fan until I finished the book. I would only recommend this book to people who read a lot other wise I don't think you will find it enjoyable."
"I highly recommend reading this book and wouldn't be surprised if it becomes a movie eventually. It is a page-turner story about a young women who is depressed due to her own divorce which she self-medicates with alcohol, and imagines the happiness of another young couple whom she sees regularly at a train stop.  She becomes embroiled in their affairs with many twists and turns including her x-husband and his new wife."
"Honestly I do not understand how this book gets on and stays on the best seller list!It is really ho-hum----and some of the books on the BS list have been there so longwhile others (new ones) get passed over.  Really have never understood their wayof chosing.  Now, one that is wonderful is ""All the Light that ever was""---aninspiring story and lovely writing."
"I thought this was going to be a straightforward  mutder mystery but how wrong I was, lots of twists and red herrings intertwined with personal pain and emotional suffering. Quite dark and sinister and a little disturbing at various points in the book, a good read, not one that can be skipped through lightly as it tackles dysfunctional relationships with dire consequences."
"It's a while since I read this book but really enjoyed it. Did eventually work out 'who dunnit' but not too quickly and it was a great read in between. The main character (girl watching from the train) was a bit pathetic so no one really believed her until the end. Would like to have seen her get her life back together a bit more, her ongoing issues didn't seem any better by the end."
"Unlikable characters, all pathetic to such an extent that it's difficult to stay interested. The ending just wasn't good enough, didn't make sense and I just wish it had been more interesting after suffering through the miserable lives of these sad people. That being said, it was a quick and easy read and it seems to appeal to the mainstream."
"This is one of the best books I have read this year!! Its not what you would expect. And it takes a long time to get to a point where you sense a mystery. But the characters are so developed and intriguing. I love how the main character seems like a nut case but the whole book throws you for twist after twist until you see how not crazy she is. I really want more, though the ending was great."
"I enjoyed this book, but not with out some effort. The main character I found annoying and stupid. I highly dislike annoying and stupid women. For that reason I continued reading for the plot alone. Story telling involves conflict and change. There is plenty of conflict and by the end there is a significant change."
"This book is an excellent, impossible-to-put-down read. The story line is compelling, the main character frustrating yet relatable, and throughout it all an intense mystery that keeps the reader on their toes. It is definitely meant for adults, but I highly recommend it!"
"I may be in the minority, but I did not care for this book or for the characters. Drunk, somewhat delusional young woman inserts herself into a tragedy in awkward ways. The women are either somewhat helpless or otherwise unlikeable. The men are all mean, violent, uncaring, insincere, ready at the drop of a hat to divulge confidential information, or a combination of all these. Don't waste precious reading time on this one."
"I bought this book on my Kindle thinking it sounded like an interesting idea for a story. THEN I read the reviews and wished I hadn't bothered. But when I ran out of other books to read, I turned to this and read it... and was pleasantly surprised. I actually didn't hate this book. It wasn't as bad as some reviews would have me believe. It was decent. Not amazing, but not terrible either."
"A cleverly written novel with a clever plot. The characters are a divorcee with a drinking problem who cannot let go, an adulterous husband who doesn't live up to his responsibilities, a new wife with a justifiable paranoia, a pregnant adulteress and an abusive husband. They are all linked by one street in the London suburbs with dramatic results. A first novel with very few weak places. I have already ordered Paula Hawkins next novel."
"Entertaining novel throughout the entire read. I liked some of the readers better than others. The fun part was there were three readers, so that's not a large complaint. It took me almost until the end of the book to solve the mystery which made me listen for more extended periods of time. (I listened to it on Audible) I would give this book 4.5 stars if that was available. Well worth your credits."
"I really liked this book.  It starts out kind of like a voyeur mystery where Rachel, the girl on the train, observes people in their homes as she rides the train passing their homes and watching them from the window of the train.  She imagines what their life is like and eventually becomes involved in a mystery that involves the very people she is observing. I have recommended this book to others I know who enjoy reading."
"This book has lots of unusual twists.  It really captures what it's like to be alone, depressed, drinking too much.  Blaming yourself for everything because it has to be true,  memory lapses, blackouts, loss of job.It keeps you guessing for a long time what is really going on.Can you watch people from a distance and really know them?Can you live with someone and really know them, that is the more intriguing question."
"I'd read the first 5% or so and was feeling that I'd been tricked into reading a chick-lit book. At first, the story seemed (IMHO) to have little direction and was more of a troubled woman's stream of consciousness—well-written, but possibly without appeal to male readers.But guys, stick with it. The plot becomes clear and compelling about 10% through, and the book becomes a rewarding read.I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"I wanted to read this before it came out on video and am I ever glad I did!!This book was fantastic, it made you feel pity, scared, confused, and daring all at once. This was definitely a page turner and had mysteries within the mystery. I absolutely loved this story."
Very quick read couldn't put the book down. Just when I thought I figured it out the story added another twist. I recommend it and suggest it would be a great read on a rainy weekend.
"I picked up this book because it sounded like an interesting plot...a girl day dreaming about the lives of strangers witnesses something out of the ordinary and how her actions effected the lives of those people but also how her own life was intertwined. Very good story and if you use the whisper sync, the performance was well done. I particularly liked the different point of views of each of the main characters through out the story."
Very good book.  Challenging to understand writer's style until about 30% thru book.  Great character development.
"I love thrillers. I love smart thrillers, with compelling characters that show psychological depth. I love a story line with twists and turns that create surprises along the way and an ending I can't predict. The Girl on the Train provides all that and more! I couldn't put it down. Paula Hawkins is my new favorite writer and I just have one question for her: when is the next book? ! ? Really, don't keep us waiting too long."
"Honestly, I'm struggling to get through this book (3/4 through now so I'm not done). I'm plugging along because that is what I do with books that have been recommended and I've spent money on. I don't care for the characters. They don't engage me. It doesn't thrill me. I don't know London and can't relate. Overall it's just BLAH. Going to complete it though just to find out about the missing woman..."
I was bored with the redundancy in the first 23% of the book.  Everyone told me to stay with it and it would get better. This proved to be true and the last 25% of the book was well written and it was hard to put down.  I feel 3 stars is kind of a stretch.
Not my kind of read.  To slowWWW!  Did not like the back and forward. Hard to keep straight.  The ending was not even GREAT.  Don't know how it was on the best list for that long.  That is what sold me.  Would not do that again.  But that is me.  You may enjoy.
"I enjoyed the book, but found that the main character was some what frustrating in that she continued to make her life miserable. It reaffirms that the problem with addition is that it affects all the people in ones life. Not just the addicts. this gave the book a dark tone."
"It was well written and kept my interest, but all of the characters where just retched. I couldn't enjoy the book because all of them were just awful people. Great mystery though!"
"I was interested in this book when I observed previews for the movie.  I decided I wanted to read the book before deciding on seeing the movie...I was blown away.  I enjoyed the author's style of writing, her pace of the storyline...I was pleasantly pleased with the purchase."
"I didn't read this, but bought it for my wife. She's a prolific reader with good taste (well...she's my wife) so I listen to her opinions when I'm hungry for my next read. She said this one was just ""boring."" The plot took was slow to develop and when it did, was unexciting. ""Just another murder."" She struggled to finish it, saying ""...the last quarter was OK if you make it that far."""
Enthralled from the first few pages and anticipation builds till the end. Easy read. Hard to put down. Good book club choice. Recommend highly.
Slowly draws you into the drama until you can't put the book down.  Interesting by play with the trains.  Great if you like trains.
Heard about this book from a friend during her excitement over a movie to be released his year about the book. Not at all disappointed! Great read!
"I really did like this book and would recommend it.  I am writing this review a bit late as I read the book awhile ago.  I think this book had surprises.  While the main character struggled with her alcoholism, made bad decisions, she certainly was astute at the end.  So review short but wanted to share a worth while read."
"Since this has been on the NYT best seller list for some time, I thought I'd give it a try.Was very disappointed in the story curve...seemed like it took forever to cut to the chase,and when you got there at last, Predictable.I normally devour good novels, but I had to force myself to finish this one.Maybe it's my 'guy' point of view, but I can see why this might be considered more appealing to those of the opposite gender since it may be easier to relate to the main character from that viewpoint, but I was on the verge of asking Amazon for a refund."
"Reminiscent of Gone Girl. In a story with three primary female characters, it's sad that none are projected as confident, moral, strong or independent woman. One is alcohol dependent, one has mental health issues, and one takes pleasure in playing the role of ""mistress"" and stealing another woman's husband... Yet another book, authored by a female writer, that projects all the female characters as weak, deceitful, or troubled."
"The book centers around the actions of three women, Rachel, Megan, and Anna. Throughout the story they all seemed to bob around in a sea of toxic estrogen, overwrought emotionally and insecure, with first one and then the other popping up to the surface.  The protagonist Rachel is an especially irritating character. Her alcoholic ramblings that inevitably become penitent self-reproachful binges quickly become tiresome. She is a ding-bat who never ever learns. I don't believe it is a ""tell"" to say that she doesn't die in the end, but many readers will wish she did. If you slog it out and get to the climax, one character's actions are completely incomprehensible, and a generally weak plot then becomes totally contrived.I think I would recommend this book to someone who doesn't really care about a well constructed mystery but would enjoy wallowing around in a swamp of illogical emotional agitation. Two stars, not one, because if you like riding trains there's a lot of that."
She alternates the characters and dates among the chapters so you have to keep track of who you're reading about and when it took place. The story is not told sequentially. The movie would have been very confusing if I had not read the book.
"After picking up ""The Girl on the Train"" at the suggestion of a friend, I was excited to read a book from an author I've never heard of, but skeptical that it could be as good as what my friend said.I was wrong.  It far exceeded any expectations that I could have had.  Paula Hawkins weaved a plot full of twists and turns with characters that developed and made you both cringe with their actions and cheer them at varying parts in the book.While other reviewers have waxed poetic about the plot and character development, I will simply leave my review by saying ""WOW"".  I am sad that Paula Hawkins doesn't have many more books for me to dive into and I hope that she writes... fast.  :)  I haven't read a book that I was THIS into in a very long time."
"The only reason I gave this book 4 stars and not 5, is only because the main character is really hard to root for.  She is a compulsive drinker and blacks out a lot.  Her black outs play into the story, it is just annoying as to how much she drinks.  Other than that, I felt the books was well written and very easy to get drawn into.  Heads up: The story takes place in and around London, so some of the vocabulary that was used is not normal words to Americans.  There wasn't a lot of British words, but wanted to make sure readers know."
"Great read!!I loved the way, Hawkins separates the characters by name and times, very unique.It's very Hitchcockian, with suspense and twists to the end.I can't wait to read more from, Paula Hawkins, and to see the movie they're making from this book."
"I LOVED this book, until I got to the end.  The exposition and explanation of what really happened was presented in such a bad-movie villain fashion, as in ""This is what I did and this is how I did it!! bwahaha"" totally killed the book for me and left a bad taste in my mouth.  Maybe it bothered me so much because the rest of the book was so strong.  I read it in a day and was very much enjoying it until the big reveal.  Probably a good choice for a book club, there is a lot to talk about what you like and what you don't like."
"Normally I believe thet the book is always better than the moview.  In this case, I have a funny feeling the movie will be better than the book.The pace will hopefully move faster and maybe I'll get a better feel of the characters involved."
It was entertaining. I wanted to read it before seeing the movie. The details in the book filled in the blank spaces that the movie left out. it was a fascinating look at several different characters and their thoughts.
"The whole premise of this book was so insipid, like the writer was noodling around for a cute idea to write about as she sat on the train to work. And she started writing and wasn't at all sure where to go with it so she tried making the characters intriguing, but they weren't. Many of the voices were so similar you couldn't tell who was speaking except by looking at the very pale gray label at the top of the page. The people she portrayed were really pathetic, totally lacking a raison d'etre in life. I finished the book because I had nothing else to read at the moment."
Worst book ever!  Don't waste your time. I'm not sure how it was even published.  I give it one star for good marketing.
"OK - Reading this story was a bit like watching a train wreck.....could not take my eyes off the page and had to keep reading! The author's unique way of telling the story was captivating as well. It was like reading each character's thoughts and then weaving it all together, while constantly trying to guess what would happen next. Won't say too much - don't want to spoil the read for those of you yet to pick up the book."
I will not recommend it to friends. The payoff was vastly insufficient to justify the time I spent getting to the end.
"It's as much a mystery as it is a thriller. Not quite as intense as Gone Girl, but equally satisfying. The heroine begins as an unappealing alcoholic with an empty life that she fills with voyeur-type fantasies. By the end, the reader has a sympathetic view of her plight. As a therapist myself, I found the characters' psychological profiles dead on. All this made for a very interesting book club discussion for my group."
"A main character that was annoying and constantly made decisions that no normal human being would make...a side character that I'm still confused on what her purpose was... and another side character that actually has an interesting storyline,  she just barely got any spotlight."
A literary device used by Paula Hawkins is off-putting to me and that device is to use more than one character as first person. If you can get past that artifice then my wife says the rest of the book is worth reading. The author was a journalist before putting fingers to keyboard to write this novel and that earlier style shows through.
"I do not know if it is because I have read SO many books over time, but I find it harder and harder to find a book that compels me to read it.  Though this one built slowly, it did end up being a book that I did not want to close at night.  Dark as with Gone Girl, this book did not disappoint.  A book of fine literature?  No, but one worthy of the time commitment and fully entertaining!"
"If anyone in this book had approached alcoholism as an illness and not a character flaw, this would have been a very boring tale.  Still, it kept nagging at me: why doesn't anyone offer her help instead of pity?"
"A little slow at the start, but builds to a great crescendo and finish. Really well written. A nice read."
"Reading the electronic version, I experienced a lot of confusion about who the first person was. After a third of the book, I caught on. It also seemed to plod along until clues to the outcome became more plentiful. At that point, it was hard to stop reading at bedtime."
Storyline just OK....nothing special....and if it is to be a film....a 'made-for television' type of crime drama.  Not so great...truly.
"As stated, this is similar, yet different from Gone Girl; psychological twists and turns; definitely a dark feel.  However, I could not put it down and wanted to read as fast as I could to get to the end to find out what exactly took place.  Highly recommend!"
"I'm so sorry to say - this was not my favorite.  It is a page-tuner, for sure.  And I can see why so many people liken this suspense to Gone Girl - so many shady characters.  I liked it well enough, but the end is a little silly.  The ""baddie"", who shall not be named, sits there and explains all the sordid details that person thinks that s/he is going to get away with it.  Come on, haven't you ever watched Scooby Doo?"
In the beginning I wasn't paying attention to the titles of each chapter and the dates.  Once the plot started to unfold and the dimensions of each character developed I went back and reread first few chapters. Then the unfolding story made sense.  In the end I was glad I stuck with the book which provided food for thought about some of the serious social issues the author delved into.
I enjoyed this book a lot. Was just a little confusing in the beginning keeping dates & people straight. Rachel was such a good character & her dealing with her addiction & loss of her marriage was heartbreaking. Anna was not nice but I wouldn't be either if my husband's ex kept calling him.
The beginning was really slow moving and things didn't really start happening until the first 100 pages. Kind of confusing at first trying to backtrack between present at future. It's really only worth reading the last 60 pages or so. Not everything it was hyped up to be.
"I may in the minority but I enjoyed this kindle version of the book for 75 percent , however I found the last 25 percent a bit too dragged out and a bit too unremarkable. I actually had a hard time finishing the book. This is just my humble opion of course."
A frustrating read. The chapters become repetitive about one third of the way through but if the reader soldiers on and stays with the book they will be rewarded with a howler of an ending. There are subtle hints of where it eventually does go but one does not think the writer is really going to follow through with such an obviously engineered conclusion. She does and it disappoints. It's remarkable that this book is a best seller.
This is my first time to read Paula Hawkins book but she does an excellent job with her characters _ at first I had to keep them straight as I read each chapter but it doesn't take long to keep them separate and to know who is who. I recommend this book it's a good drama.
"This was a book that kept my interest from the beginning.  I would not compare it to Gone Girl, as others have.  Unlike Gone Girl, I actually liked a couple of these characters...thinking there was some good in them.  There were flawed characters, which was great, but not everyone was completely awful.Overall, the story was interesting and had some nice twists and turns.  I had figured out the guilty rather early, but I had not figured out all the ins and outs.Would recommend!"
"I got sucked into this book because there are such obvious details being left out that I wanted to know what happened next. As it would turn out, the suspicion I had within the first few chapters of where the book was going was spot on. Yes, I cared about knowing what the ending was. At the ending, though, I found myself not caring what happened to the characters. The plot could have twisted in a way to make at least one of them likable but in the end it just felt like a soap opera that I wished would be over already. Maybe good for beach reading, but don't waste valuable time on it. I stayed up 2 hours past my normal bedtime reading it and I wish I had those hours back in the form of sleep."
"I kept hearing about this book and was really looking forward to reading it.  I've not yet finished it as I've found it very hard to follow the story line, flips back and forth between present and past, and I have to keep going back to put the pieces together.  I think that, unfortunately, I am just reading it too late each evening and too tired to concentrate so I'm planning to start over when I go on vacation and can dedicate more rested reading time to it.  I'll update my opinion after that."
"I enjoyed this book for its genre! I didn't like all the filler in the middle, though. For example, the Scott and Rachel drama, the constant calls to Tom, the repeated relapses. I also found it particularly hard to like ANY of the six focused character. I DID like that they all had fatal flaws, etc. The ending was pretty damn well written. Kept me on the edge of my seat for the last fourty or so pages."
This book was recommended by a coworker and I must admit it was very entertaining. I loved the suspense of not knowing who the murderer was and trying to figure it out through Rachel's distorted point of view.
Each character was fully developed-which left me wondering who possibly could have done this horrible deed.  I started to think that a random stranger would be the pick for this crime that affected so many lives.  Very good read.
A thriller which has the potential to keep you on your seat-edge but fails due to the complexity introduced by having first person narration switching between a no. of different persons involved in the story while at the same time switching the time frame of the narration. Result was continuous minor frustration particularly when returning to story after a break in regaining the story threads.
"Am almost finished with this book which I can only put down for a minute.  Love the style of writing. I have had to go over some of it again as I always have the NEED to never miss anything and in this book I don't want to miss anything.  I reread one of the character's dialogues because I was not clear on some things. But that is OK. This is the beauty of the story, a real mystery.  I had a hunch and think it may be true. Can't wait to finish but then what will I read???"
"I may have hung on for about a quarter of the book. I got tired of the drug and alcohol-addled remblings.There may have been violence and sexual content, but I gave up before that occurred.  I kept waiting for something, anything, to happen. It didn't."
"I enjoyed the book, and found the characters of Rachel and Jess/Megan to be pretty interesting and well developed. But I didn't care for the ""reveal"" towards the end.***SPOILER****It was ok that Tom was the one responsible for Megan's disappearance but I didn't like how he just seemed to morph into a completely different character. By the end he was talking and acting like a corny villain from a bad thriller. That kind of bothered me.***END SPOILER***Also with Anna it felt like the author sort of didn't care about writing her chapters and didn't try to develop a concrete person. But other than that I thought it was a nicely paced and well told mystery with an intriguingly flawed group of characters."
"I'm only half way into book.  Confusing character changes, didn't realize the ""person"" was changing from chapter to chapter.  Just getting interesting at half way point.  If I didn't like to finish what I start, I would have put the book aside long ago."
I was excited to start this book but the excitement quickly changed to confusion and then disappointment.  I struggled through to the finish even though it took me several times of putting it down and then picking it up again.  Would I recommend it?  No.
Don't waste your time.  Hard to follow because the characters and the time period switches back and forth. The Man character is a drunk and is not stable.  It is hard to follow.  I do not understand why so many people love this book.
"Probably the hype around this book's popularity drew me in, and I hoped for a read that was intriguing but not too challenging.  Certainly there was enough that compelled me about the plot and characters for me to want to finish the book and find how the mystery unfolded, but I found the bleakness of the scenario and the lives of the characters quite disturbing.  Be warned: this is not an uplifting read!"
"I liked it enough. Writing style and plot very similar to Gone Girl, which wasn't my favorite book. So this wasn't my favorite either, but it kept my interest enough to keep reading. Characters weren't all that likable. I didn't really care what happened to any of them. Plot was ok, though was able to figure out the ending way before. Though, if you liked Gone Girl, you'll like this too."
"Had a little bit of a hard time following it till I watched the trailior on internet before the movie came out.  However I am looking forward to seeing the movie. Putting faces to the people in the book helped, was able to follow easier. Want to see the movie soon."
Fantastic book! A page turner for sure!
"I was contemplating to skip this review. I don’t like to be negative, just because it may not be my cup of tea. In a real life I practice a rule, what I don’t understand, I simply respect, instead of judging it.This is a book review site, and I feel I have to stay true to its purpose.I was very excited to read this book after all the commercial hype about it. I have to admit that I set myself for a real disappointment. I will try to stay constructive and short.CONS:Title - The word ‘girl’ is completely wrong for a divorced thirty something WOMAN.Plot - Predictable, similar concept “Lady on the train” 1945.Characters - Three messed up women, two abusive men. All narrators speak in first person.Ending - Completely flat, fell apart.Pace - First half very slow.PROS:Writing - Paula Hawkins has a unique narrative structure.To me this wasn’t really a mystery, more like a character study. I don’t mind depressing, negative or dark, but non of the characters were likable enough to root for them."
"The author's style of presenting the story is rare in the sense that it's not the usual Chapter 1 , 2 and so on.  As presented, you get into the mind of several characters, their developing and interweaving story. I specially like that of the main character Rachel who at the start was such a loser but who eventually vindicated herself after she put her act together. A good read."
I couldn't put this book down! It's a fast read that keeps you on the edge of your seat! Loved it
A little disappointed the book. Don't get me wrong I liked the book but all the hype had me expecting more.  Overall the book was good and the twist was a surprise to me. Of course my wife said she figured it out half way through the book
"Loved that each character told the story from their point of view , reflecting only what they knew. Really suspensefull right to the end. I'm glad i didn't see the movie first. The written word gives so much detail you don't want to miss."
"With a slow start, the book picked up toward the middle and became suspenseful at the end. The flashbacks were helpful in learning the backstories of the characters and allowing you to understand their motivations for there actions. I would recommend the book as it held my interest throughout and was an entertaining read."
"I found this quite boring and predictable. None, and I mean NONE of the characters were likable. I figured out ""whodunnit"" less than a third of the way through. I was so disappointed in it after all of the hype that I left the hardcover on a pool chair on purpose while on vacation. Free book for the next sucker who picked it up."
"A+, I really enjoyed this book by Paula Hawkins, she keeps up a quick pace of story telling without getting mired down by unnecessary descriptions.  The characters are realistic and flawed, and she does a fine job of weaving them all together.  If you're looking for a ""who done it"", then I think you would enjoy this."
"I loved it so much that I didn't put it down & finished in one day! Very good story. First book by this author for me & I can't wait to see what else she has written.Also, there is a movie coming out soon that was developed from thus book."
"Book had a great hook. The story was just so well- developed. I had hoped that there will be a movie based on this book, and I just found out a couple days that the movie will be out Oct 7! I'll definitely go to see it. Overall, the book was a fun read and I would have never guessed who the real culprit was. Great job Paula Hawkins!!"
"I don't read a lot of mystery-type fiction but something in a review led me to think I'd enjoy this. I wasn't disappointed. The whodunit aspect worked, and the protagonist/narrator is deeply flawed, deeply self-aware, and consistently appealing as a character.  I read this on a Kindle, and one aspect of the book highlighted the principal drawback of the device: the difficulty of flipping back to a remembered page in order to double-check a fact. The book has a lot of short chapters that jump around in time. Each one starts with a date, and it's important to keep track of them, especially in the early stages. If you're reading on a Kindle, pay close attention to them or be prepared to spend a lot of time trying to unscramble things later on."
I was hesitant to read this at first because I read a bad review but I'm so glad I changed my mind! This book sucked me in and took me for a great ride. I love the different perspectives and really didn't have it figured out until the very end.
I like this book. It has a very nice flow to the story. My only issue is that I felt like the ending was very predictable and no I did not see the movie first. Overall this was a good book and I would recommend it.
"The four stars (instead of 5) reflect my distaste for nearly every character in the book, primarily the Girl on the train.  But for writing and making the reader writhe, it deserves five stars.  The denouement is astonishing and while I should have seen it coming, I was so caught up in the story that I tended to follow it through the Girl's eyes, and mind, and turmoil.  Really a remarkable achievement and worth it at the end."
"Very interesting book.  I like English authors since they give an intereresting perspective on their country.  I looked up many words to see how she used them.  Examples:  CV, garden, a chain grocery store, childminder, etc.Should make a good movie.  It was a bit confusing in that each chapter would alternate between characters.  Interesting device.  Would read another by her since I'm certain she will write more."
"This book was really good.  Although it took me quite a while until I got into it, when it finally came together to me (perhaps I'm a little slow?).  I had a hard time realizing that this was the same girl...I thought it was two different people and was confused for a while.  Anyway,  as the story unfolds, it became clearer who everyone was.  The ending was a surprise and it's always nice to be surprised at the end.  Good book."
I'm reading this right now.  It's a great read and I'm really enjoying it. Well written and I recommend it. Am very anxious to see the movie
Absolutely best book I have read in quite some time. Couldn't put it down. Can't wait to see the moviel
"This book exceeded my expectations.  I read it simply because it kept coming up as a recommendation and I was glad I did.  I couldn't put it down.  I love the format of telling it in each person's perspective and the alternating in the timeline.  It can get confusing, but never for a moment did I lose interest.  Some of it was predictable, but not enough to make it not worth reading.  Simply put, I couldn't put it down."
Interesting storytelling method that really gets you engaged with the characters.  I really like the 'everything is not always as it seems' plot and inevitable clash of characters in the end.  It did get a bit tedious with the repeated Rachel insecurities and depression.
"thought it would be an interesting perspective of a young gal who has to ride the train to better herself rather than the alcoholic who rides the train to drink ......yes, its a narrative of someone is the downward spiral of drinking but that was soooooo not what i was thinking it would be ....i was hoping for an introspective of an anonymous person on a train rather than someone who needs AA!"
"Good character descriptions, I didn't like any of them though. Bunch of rotten selfish people doing very destructive things to others & then  lying to themselves about what they really are. The cops, the therapist, even Scott's mom who are minor characters are ugly & sad. One red headed drunk was the only one the author did not throw under the train.  A mystery for sure, but more of a slice of life of mundane disturbed people."
"After the initial confusion of WHO is doing the narration of each chapter (be sure to pay attention to the name at the top of each chapter), this book is a gripping tale that leads you on and teases you until you suspect nearly everyone of  possibly committing the unscrupulous deeds that evolve.  Pay close attention and don't plan to get much else done in the next few hours until the last page has been turned."
"This is a different tack on storytelling.  The author jumps from character to character with them speaking in the first person.  It is very well done in how the peculiarities of each character are perceived by the other characters, and what appears to be accurate and true, may not be so.  The author keeps the reader involved from the beginning to the end."
"Awesome novel. Quick read with multiple characters point of view. At first, I wondered why one character's entry was almost a year previous to the others, but then it caught up in the end; She timed it perfectly. If you enjoyed Gone Girl or a suspense novel with multiple point of views, then you will enjoy this. I'm currently looking for more novels similar to this because it was just so interesting!"
"I know many people enjoyed this.  However, I read a ton...like 2 books a week.  And having experienced so many wonderful stories - this one falls short.  The main character is boring and whines about everything (think Goldfinch guy boring) - life is ""all too much"" sort of saga.  If you're into folks struggling to overcome an issue - maybe this is for you.  I felt that after I read it; I'd learned nothing and had wasted my time.  No offense to the author - just not my type of book."
"Every one of the main characters in this book is not what they seem.  With lots of craziness evident in the behavior of several of them, it soon becomes clear why a psychiatrist is a central character.But nothing is simple or easily explained.  The original premise of a young woman watching a couple in their back yard as her commuter train goes by daily and imagining their life together quickly turns into a complicated involvement into those lives.  With a haze of alcoholism clouding her memories and her judgements, she becomes dangerously entangled before she is able to figure out who is truly evil.This story kept me on the edge of my seat and I predict it will have the same effect on most readers."
"I wasn't sure what to expect when I started reading this.. It gripped me from the beginning and I literally couldn't put it down.. With all the major  characters,Rachel,Anna,Megan,Scott,and Tom,there's non-stop storytelling at its best.. I highly recommend this book to everyone who likes psychological mystery/thrillers!!"
I was looking forward to reading this story from other reviews and it has definitely lived up to the great ones !  Kept me in suspense the whole story.  It did get a little repetitive in the middle but once it reached the end it all made sense as to why.  Great summer read if you love suspenseful stories!
I wanted more. I was able to figure out what was happening too early. I thought the book was over hyped. Not a bad read but I guess I wanted something with more depth and hooks. I get annoyed at books that jump from character and different points in time. There are better ways to build suspense and plot. Almost seems like a way to avoid writing a deeper and suspenseful novel. Just jump from character to character at random points in time to confuse the reader. I guess I better start working on my great American novel.
"I did see the movie after.  I felt I liked the book better.  it was real, and easy to follow.I would love to have other books like that, the writer had vision.Many of my friends read the book and they enjoyed it.."
"A great beach or plane read, I guessed the ending but only near the ending. The characters are fascinating, but even better are the weird dynamics of their interactions. The heroine—is she?—is as imperfect as they come, which makes her very endearing. A first rate whodunit."
"It took a lot to get into this book. I got it on my Kindle, but had to gt the actual book from a friend in order to read it with the constant flipping between characters. I could not keep track of who said/observed what. It got good in the end of the book, but I found it a struggle to read. The funny thing is I picked this book for our book club. The discussion was better than I thought it would be but I cannot say I am a fan of this book. To compare it to Gone Girl is so far off."
This is a riveting story. Throughout the book you always have that nagging suspicion about Rachel but then you realize you are so wrong. You get to know these cast of characters so you are really surprised with this who done it.
I decided to read this book with my neighbors... And my oh my. We all LOVED it. Absolutely addicting book that will keep you interested and wanting to get to the next chapter. I had a few issues at first with the format the author used in telling the story... But it actually added to the suspense in the end. Worth it!!! A must read!!!
"This book was an amazing read. Once I started reading it, I didn't want to put it down. Rachel, the main narrator of the book, starts out as a hot mess. She is unemployed, drunk most of the time and can't get over her ex-husband, even though he cheated on her and eventually left her for the mistress. I don't want to say much more because I don't want to spoil anything. If you liked Gone Girl, I think you will like this book. I actually liked this book better than Gone Girl. Rachel is easy to sympathize with once you learn more of her backstory and I liked the end of this book better than Gone Girl also. If you are going to read this book make sure you have a few hours free because you are not going to want to stop reading until you finish."
"I found this read particularly refreshing. I most enjoyed the varying perspectives from which the story is told. I'd recommend this to anyone interested in a romantic, suspenseful drama. It took me a while to finish the book, but it was very easy to pick up where I left off each time. Overall, the book was awesome and written appropriately for the storyline."
I liked the detail and imagery. I felt like I was right there with all the characters. The date switching was a little confusing I kept forgetting when it was... i recommend this for people who like a good mystery and suspense.
"Couldn't get enough, my life made me start and stop so probably better rating if I had less interruption. I'd say more heartbreaking detail of the main character's past would be the only improvement. I particularly enjoyed hearing the message of how Rachel mistakenly valued herself thru someone else's broken perception. Oh, and how Anna got humbled. Great read :)"
"We chose to read this for our book club, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. On one hand, it brought me back to a time when people took the time to relax, riding a train for everyday travel. The author sucked me in right away with her description of characters and events, enabling me to feel as though I were actually there. The emotions were real, and twists in the story felt normal, not contrived. As I rode the train into NYC one day, I channelled the protagonist, and watched as houses flew by, and thinking what stories they may contain."
"This page turner reminds me of English mystery writers of my mothers generation. Well written, well thought out, and cleverly presented. Some of the narrative seemed repetitious, such as the repeated descriptions of black out, but overall, the suspense built nicely, and came to clever conclusion. Talented author; hope to see more of her."
"This was a little difficult to read for me, simply because the main character is an alcoholic, and I was going through a divorce from an alcoholic at the time I read this book, however, that's literally the ONLY negative thing I have to say about it! This book was suggested to me after reading Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, and the authors do have similar writing styles, although this book is based in England. I am also not typically a fan of English Lit of any kind, but this book was awesome, and I will definitely be checking out what else the author has written! Easy to read and definitely a page turner!"
"A great read.....and never suspected how it would end till close to the end. Not very sympathetic to men at all even though the women have their faults, but they are projected with a more flattering gloss."
"Okay, for me this is a tough review to write.  I ultimately did like this book.  After an adjustment period I got used to the alternating narrators.  There were times when the story drags, but not too many.  I really enjoyed the fact that Rachel, Megan and Anna were very different women, however they do have a lot in common.  Their stories could fit into many of our lives.  I think as the days pass and I find myself still thinking about the story, I have realized that maybe I liked it more than I thought."
"The Girl on the Train is a story written from three character perspectives that are connected through marriage and divorce. The main character Rachel is Tom's ex-wife who is addicted to alcohol and consequently works hard to retrieve memories of an incident that happens to her one night. Through her train rides into London, her ex-husband Tom, Megan's husband Scott, and Tom's current wife Anna, Rachel puts the pieces together to find out what happened to Meagan. This is a riveting account of Rachel's attempt to make sense of the mystery!"
"Loved the book. Somehow, I related to this book. I often look out of trains/cars and make up stories of the masses of strangers I see. Using a train, for me, brings an added flavour of Agatha Christie-which I enjoyed! A lot of twists and turns, mostly unpredictable. I would want to read more books by the authoress!! On my personal scale, the Violence ( from 0-5) was a low 1.5. I hate unnecessary gruesomeness."
"I wanted to read this book when I found out about the movie release and it did not disappoint. I could not put this book down, a real page Turner till the end. Great flow. Thank you Paula Hawkins for writing one of the best books I have read in a long time."
This was an interesting read. I had most of it figured out halfway through . Still completely gives you a real time look at how alcoholism effects you. It just is kind of desperate and very far fetched. Enjoyed the writing style though.
"Congratulations Paula Hawkins. While I would have liked to see a few elements of this book tweaked, ie the technical research for the psychologist seemed very light, ditto the lack of rudimentary detective work on behalf of the cops, this is an amazing and compelling read that grabs the reader by the throat and carries them away. I find it hard to believe the average mystery reader could figure this out...I write books and I didn't have a clue until a glimmer 2/3 of the way in. Bravo for compelling and realistic characters and situations. If this was a 10th book, I might have rated it a 4, but I'm a grouch. Just very impressive, fun, wrap you up for a whole day read. Buy yourself a present, get this book."
"The characters start to develop slowly but deliberately; and the reason, which looking back now is to not give too much of the main story plot away, as well as, to not show who is most innocent and whom the worst and most flawed of all of the characters really is. Although, they are all ""morally"" flawed characters the ""real sociopath"" at the end reveals himself/herself to the reader and the others in an ""ahha monent!"" Good read overall, not as crisp and sharply written as Gone Girl but It is perhaps that it takes place in England. I figured out who done it by mid book but the end surprised me."
"This is a riveting, mesmerizing book. The lead character, Rachel, is vividly drawn. She is fundamentally an alcoholic out of control. The novel relies on alternative chapters narrated by Rachel, Megan -- the victim -- and Anna who is married to Tom, Rachel's ex-husband. These chapters drive the plot, but are also internal monologues. At times Rachel and Megan sound somewhat alike in their unhappiness, but Megan has a far more promiscuous past. As with the women, there is an overlap between Tom and Scott, Megan,s surviving husband and a main suspect of her murder. Rachel's often bumbling attempt to solve Megan's murder reflects her often equally bumbling attempt to achieve sobriety. But, . In the end it is Rachel's wonderful imagination that prevails."
"The raves about this book aren't off track!  I can see why this is one of the Best Sellers for late 2015 and 2016 since it is such a great book!  The author keeps you on the edge of your seat by alternating between characters involved in the plot of the story.  Ending threw me for a loop, LOVED IT!"
"Rachel is a hopeless wretch..straddling the rails of sanity. Her story is an endless ride, going back and forth between reality and stupor all because of her fascination with Tom, her ex husband. When a young women is murdered, Pathetic Rachel feels obligated to find out why. Which brings her right back on track..Why she drinks, why she doesn't trust herself. A lot of intrigue here..and of course, true feminism discourse...blame everything on the guy. This is an interesting book. Give the author a 5 for original plot. Rachel..Give her a 2 for making bad choices."
"While I thoroughly enjoyed the book, I'm certain I would not befriend any of the characters in it.  I can't think of any book I've read recently that has such screwed up people within its covers.  It isn't that they are unlikeable, but I found myself diagnosing their ""quirks"" as the story unfolded.The book was well written, a page turner, and suspenseful.  It delivered everything promised on the dust cover."
"The first time I started reading I set aside after just a few pages. Several months and many novels later I gave it another try. Finished in one day. The outcome is predictable but you are not certain your anticipation is on point until the end.  That the mystery can be ""solved"" is itself a sad reminder of the prevalence of these circumstances."
"On recommendation, I picked this up. I liked the interwoven life stories of the main characters, but it felt there was a decided lack of connection between the tertiary and main characters. An interesting approach to the storytelling, though I didn't find any of the characters at all likable. Except for maybe Rachel, who I didn't like until the last 30 pages."
"Really interesting protagonist that I was intrigued with in the beginning, but as the book moves forward, I began to dislike her more and more.  Not because she has faults, but because she is a total idiot (apart from her problems with alcoholism) - which became hard to swallow given the books' plot.  It was the plot that kept me reading though and I admit, the ending did not reveal itself until the last pages.  Easy to read."
"Lots of hype around this book.  I mostly found it tedious as an alcoholic tries to remember what she did or didn't witness.  I'd say it falls right in the middle -- better than some, but not as good as it should be."
"Hard to follow with the multiple narrators.  Except for the stated location, no evidence of this being in England.  Written as if it were in a suburb of maybe Kansas City.  By the end of it, I didn't even care ""whodunnit"".  And, after a little time since I read the book, I don't even remember!  Don't waste your time and money!  I bought into this solely because of the hype -- wish I had my money back!"
"An okay read; kept me thinking while I spent time thinking how the various characters related to each other and what all that meant. The ending sort of surprised me. Yes, the mystery is solved, but it felt like a very abrupt end without real closure. I probably wouldn't have chosen this book to read if it wasn't the next Book Club book."
"Like the narrator's daily train trips, this book is a meaningless start, stop, and return to where we were in the previous chapter. No character to cheer for here - only a tangle of liars.  After reading other reviews, I thought there must be something good.  Didn't find it."
"Definitely entertaining and quick. But I don't like how the author tries to falsely lead you to think things when the truth is already obvious...just gets annoying. Also, the main character is really deplorable and incredible...always kind a downside to a book! It's like a dumbed down version of Gone Girl, which was really masterfully written! But it was a nice, easy read for before bed."
"I kept hoping that I would feel some compassion for at least one of the characters, but through the entire book, I felt absolutely no empathy.  The twists in the plot were interesting, but I did not feel compelled to pick up the book every chance I had.  I finished it because I had devoted so much time to it and wanted to know how the plot revealed the murderer eventually...I had already figured it out."
"This was a pretty good mystery. As many have said this story does have an element of Hitchcock’s Rear Window.  A woman riding on a train thinks she sees  something sinister but she’s not exactly sure just what she saw.  Another woman has gone missing and there are plenty of suspects who may be involved. Lots of evil, intrigue, and plot twists, certainly enough to keep you going throughout the book.  My problem was that I didn’t find either of the main characters very sympathetic.  You want to be rooting for them but they are both weak, damaged, and deceitful.  So who can you trust?  But certainly this novel is well worth reading."
"This book is like a Gone Girl lite. Lots of twists and turns in the plot. Rachel is an alcoholic, divorced, and unemployed. She rides the train everyday to fool her flat mate that she is still working. She passes by her old home where her ex-husband lives with his new wife and baby. A few doors down, there is a couple. Rachel gives them names and makes up vignettes about their lives. Then the wife disappears and Rachel is involved but she doesn't remember how. I think the biggest problem is that, at least for me, I didn't particularly like Rachel, she is a bit of a mess. However, by the end I sympathize with her."
"I bought this book on Monday and finished it on Thursday...it was that thrilling. I didn't love this book, though, and now I feel like I need to read something light and fluffy. It's very dark with little warmth or humor to balance the sinister. Everyone who's compared this book to a Gillian Flynn book is right...the books have that same dark feeling. The story itself is all right, but at the end I badly wanted to know a little more about what happened to the characters.This would be a good book to take to the beach-it's an easy read. I bought the Audible version at a reduced price and the narrators are great."
"Really good book. Just when I thought i knew who was good and who was not, the real motives of the characters reveal themselves. The only reason i didn't give a 5 star is because I guessed who the antagonist was about half way through."
"Enjoyable, there are some very interesting twists, characters are well written and interesting. I have to say from the movie trailer, the book, ( not sure how the movie will go) was not at all what I expected. That was a very pleasant surprise."
"Given all of the hype I'd seen in reviews, I was quite disappointed with The Girl on the Train.A mystery? Maybe. But suspense? Hardly!The three main female characters were all so insecure (although, admittedly in different ways) and therefore so similar, if the author hadn't labelled each chapter with the character's name, it would have taken a page or two to figure out which character's point of view I was seeing. While the author tried to make the rather predictable plot more suspenseful by using flashbacks, this only made the characters more confusing.  Overall, the plot was a good idea, but it didn't hold together for me at all."
"It is a well-written tale, but with a lot of disturbed characters.  The only person of good characteristics is the roommate of the main character, and she was not prominent in the story line.  I prefer a book with a character with whom I can identify or cheer for, or admire.  Not many folks in this book to admire.  On the other hand, I felt it compelling enough to dislike putting it down; but as well as it is written, it is still not enough for me to read anything like it again.  Of course, my primary dislike was plentiful here with f-bombs every few pages -- those disturb my train of thought and I wish ""hell"" and ""damn"" would come back into vogue.  Please....."
"Redundant, whiny, slow, pitiful and uninteresting characters. Flashbacks, more flashbacks, different dull character point of view. I am 34% in on this book and dread picking it up. Trying to figure out HOW there is a movie to be released. There is NO substance."
"I expected this to be awesome, and for the first half it was, then it quickly became ""okay"" when things wrap up near the end. Wish I could have rented from the library instead of paying $10 for it."
"I will say this book has a nice twist at the end, but I almost didn't finish the book. I've never read a book where NOT ONE single character is likeable. The story has five main characters: Rachel, Anna, Tom, Megan, and Scott.  Megan goes missing...but honestly, if all five went missing at the same time, that would have made the book more bearable. I could not sympathize with any characters and hoped they would all perish somewhere in the story. I will say Paula Hawkins at least makes the book worth finishing with a good ending."
"The book was enjoyable although I found the majority of the individuals in it to be very shallow.  Admittedly, the protagonist had her share of problems but in the long run, Rachel, her roommate and the therapist turned out to be the most decent of the lot."
Exciting thriller that keeps you wanting to read more. Good writing and complexity of characters. I enjoyed this book a lot.
"This book was not a page turner, as advertised for me. Maybe it was not my style of book.  However, I could not connect with any of the characters.  I also found the format difficult to follow.  I know this seems to be a popular way of book writing these days, but it just didn't  work for me with this read."
"It's no mean feat to manage all three POV characters to be un-likeable, not loathsome or love to hate, just people you don't care for. I finished the book to find out if I was right about the killer's identity, and for book club . No big surprises or twists because all the characters seemed to be hiding themselves from the reader, and not in a shocking motive type way."
"Wow! I read in the evenings and often have a glass of wine too. Not while reading this book! If you are struggling with maybe thinking you drink a bit too much...read this, it'll sober you up. The characters were tragic and so is the story but it is written well and I enjoyed all of the London connections. I picked this for my book club and will know in a few weeks what they thought."
"I normally do not like books that switch back and forth between characters, but this book made it work.  It made the story move along and wasn't hard to follow.  I love a good thriller and just when I thought I had it figured out, I would be surprised.  Quick, easy read."
"Pu ti down after 60 pages.  Not only are the two main characters totally unlikable, they are totally uninteresting.  May have gotten better later but I couldn't go any further.  The technical writing was fine though.The Girl on the Train"
Really bad book. The plot is the worst and so full of holes it's hard to believe. Don't waste your time with this book.
"Does not take long to get caught up in the story.  Believable characters, really enjoyed how the story came together. Great who done it!"
"Inadequate character development, and the feeling that plot twists were mechanical routes to move the story ahead, left me feeling I could care less for the characters, or how it turned out.  And I did figure out who dunnit way before I could finally finish - and the ending was as bad as the rest.  Only finished the book as it was selected by our book club.  There was a consensus that it was not a book any of us would recommend."
Excellent storyline- the reader not only experiences firsthand the despair & hopelessness of the main character's life but also is drawn into the suspense surrounding the disappearance of another young lady. As the author reveals how these two women's lives are intertwined the reader is drawn deeper into a complex mystery. I could not put this book down! Highly recommend.
"I got sucked into all ""The Girl on the Train"" hype. I should have just stayed away from it, aware of all the comparisons it was getting to Gone Girl. I should have known it's not going to be my cup of tea. As with Gone Girl, I had predicted the ending way before I was anywhere near the middle of the book. Unlike Gone Girl, however, the narrator in ""The Girl on the Train"" did feel a lot more real than any of the characters in Gone Girl did. I know, I know, I'm not reviewing Gone Girl. Let me just say this: I liked The Girl on the Train enough to give it four stars. It was engaging, easy to read, and, overall, entertaining for what it is."
"Though 2 stars is a low rating this book isn't terrible by any means, it's just nothing exceptional. The writing was good, I can't fault Paula Hawkins on that. The problem is the disdainful characters. My contempt for them stems not from their acts but rather their lack of any redeeming, interesting, qualities. I can be enthralled by characters like Dorian Grey or Frank Underwood regardless of their unsightly actions because their personalities stand out. In The Girl on the Train each character is only a collection of actions and plot related concerns that changes like ""clouds scudding across the sky, now dark, now light."""
"In true mystery/suspense form, the tale unfolds bit by bit, giving you just enough to guess at who the murderer is. None of the characters are simple and flat; that's the bit that really makes for compelling reading. If you've dealt with drug addicts or alcoholics, then Rachel's bizarre choices make sense. Plus, she's relatable because who hasn't done people-watching and made up their stories? The fixation/obsession part eventually makes more and more sense. Not one character is 100% evil or courageous or even lost, just like real people. This is a very good novel that reads ""real."""
As an avid reader I was rather surprised I cannot give the book 5 stars. All the hype around it. Movie coming out. Main character drove me crazy. Maybe that was the point? Do women really act that way? I just wanted to get it read & done.
"I am an extremely picky reader, I get so frustrated when I read a book and feel like it was not worth my time. This book completely sucked me in, I found myself sneaking in a few pages or chapters when I really ought to be doing something else.  As I was approaching the end, I was completely invested in how the story would turn out and would have been miserably disappointed if it had not been well done.  I was not disappointed, this was an excellent read from beginning to end. In addition to the storyline that keeps you guessing, this book has not one but three brilliantly written, complex women characters.  One of the best books I've read so far this year."
"I was hooked by this novel early on and felt like I was watching the story unfold from the window of the train.  I enjoyed the different characters and how their lives interacted toward the end of the novel.  There were twist throughout and I loved how Rachel & Anna ended up sharing a very important secret at the end. I looked up Paula Hawkins to see if she has written anymore Kindle books, but nothing else came up. I enjoyed her writing style and hope she will write another novel!- Vicki Johnson"
"It took a little while to get into, but the story picks up & unfolds with a twist that you start to suspect partway through. It's still an interesting story. At the end, I wanted to continue following the main character. Hoping for a sequel."
"I'm not really a fan of the alternating persons style of narration, but overall, I really did like the book. For me it was hard to get in to at the beginning just because of alternating narration and time. Once I caught the flow I couldn't put it down."
By then midway point of this book I couldn't connect with nor did I like any of the characters. I suppose I am to feel sympathy for Rachel but she did just seem to be too desperate and wanting to be in the middle of everything. What I did like were the hidden aspects and the surreal quality to the plot so while this may not be for everyone the plot will keep you interested to the end.
"This book is such a page turner I plunged through it in 3 days. The plot grabs me from the beginning. A woman narrating her observations and thoughts sitting on a train. Why is she so obsessed about the people living along the train tracks? Why is she making up stories of them? What is her story? My thoughts of each character evolves through the story. As I uncovered more of their lives, the characters take on additional dimensions. At the same time, the plot leads you through twists and turns, trying to play detective and unlock the puzzle behind all this.I highly recommend this book. It will keep you intrigued and involved."
I really enjoyed this book. My goal for this summer was to read a book that really pulled my attention. This was the perfect book for a good read. I love crime solving books. The ending was of course the best part of the book because in my opinion that is not what I thought would happen.
"The story's main character is obviously troubled and her self-confidence is shaken. Putting her on this train was a clever way to convey her story. Passing very familiar locations, almost daily, enabled her to keep bringing up happier times but were constant reminders that while others were trying to move forward she was stalled in the past. What Rachel saw and what she imagined allowed readers to be privy to her thoughts, defining the manner in which the story developed. Hawkins' writing style kept me interested, but not on the edge of my seat. I am certainly willing to read more offerings by this author."
"I started this book twice. The first time I just could not get into it. The main character was so depressing. But I tried again and eventually the story got better and better. The characters became much more involved and there were some comical moments that made me laugh. Anyway, I did really enjoy the book and was intrigued with the plot and characters. I had to finish. Really good first novel for the author. I gave it a four star because the beginning was difficult and slow."
"I can't believe this is #1 on the best seller list. Interesting beginning...looking out the window of a train and day dreaming about the people you see out that window. But, then it became so repititious. How many times do we have to read how drunk Rachel is, what she drank, how sick she felt and on and on. The story could have been easily condensed. Then there wasa rush to explain the murder at the end. I was very disappointed. I also couldn't find one likeable character. (Not that this is necessary) I added 4 star because it's a good book for summer reading. Many will enjoy the mystery."
"Okay.  This is one of those books that everyone said, ""you must read this,"" and so I did.  I think every book club has it on it's list.  It is a mystery, but also a good psychological study.  The characters are well defined, and there are a lot of twists, turns, and surprises.  It was the mystery, and not the writing, that kept me reading.  This is what I would call a good 'weekend reader' or a good 'beach book.'  One doesn't need a dictionary or a PhD in literature to 'get it.'  It is fast moving and I enjoyed the British-isms immensely."
"The main character of the story was drunk during much of the narration. She spent most of the book trying to remember what happened during a blackout. She wasn't very endearing, nor were the other characters who played a role in the story telling. There were some good twists and some anticipation at the end, so that part wasn't bad. Just not a favorite overall."
"I know some people had difficulties with the main character, Rachel, but I grew to LOVE her. It started off at a relaxed pace, but before I knew it I sacrificed two days of my life to finding out what happened. I felt Rachel and her alcoholic blackouts were frustrating, but I had a lot of sympathy for her. Megan and Anna were harder. The unreliable narrator is a difficult thing to pull off--it takes a writer with a good amount of skill to pull it off effectively, and it's really, really well done here."
"At times I enjoyed this book at other times I was frustrated. It definitely is a good thriller and the plot twists were interesting and challenging. However, spending most of the book inside the minds of three extremely unrelaible narrators and having to wade through their thought processes was tedious at times. There was so much irrational/dysfunctional thinking! It reminded me of watching grade B slasher movies where the herione is always doing something stupid and you want to scream ""don't do that!"" As other reviewers have said it's hard to like anyone in this book except maybe the therapist (and even he made some highly questionable choices.) I can see why it's so popular though, because it is a page turner."
I liked to mystery of the whole book. I usually don't care for mysteries but it was a part of our book club selection so I braved the way to reading. I'm very glad that I did. Very few characters but each well thought out and creatively woven together.
"The writing is pretty good and the story is moderately interesting.  However, it develops very slowly.  The inciting incident, or at least the reader's awareness of it, does not occur until well into the book, when it turns into a murder mystery.  And then it is all too easy for the reader to figure out who did it, without the characters or the author telling us so.  So the mystery is kind of lame."
Really great book. You really don't know who did the crime until the characters do. A must read for anyone who loves figuring out puzzles.
"Thoroughly enjoyable!!! I lived in England and rode the train on the south coast on a daily basis to and from work.  There are all sorts of events that happen, like the couple carrying on an affair on the train.  Train would get to my stop and both of them got off at my stop.  The man's wife picked him up from the train station, the wife none the wiser.  Brought back funny and fond memories."
It was hard to get into this book but preservered and was glad I did.  Good book. Curious about the movie now.
"The plot was weak and under developed. The characters had a name, but no dept. The story read like the author had a good idea , but she just threw the story together. The reader had no idea who the narrators were as they were introduced into the story. To add to my disappointment, they were not realistic or believable. I'm glad this was a short story, or I might not finished it. I can't believe this was on any best seller list."
"A disjointed story about a delusional alcholic told in a rambling nonsensical fashion. If I could find a way to return this book, I surely would but I already paid for it. Why this book went to publication or received glowing accolades and sales defies logic. Do not be taken in. Go to your nearest library, and save your self 13 dollars."
"This book started out somewhat interesting and it did draw me in enough to want me to finish it; but was disappointing in the inclusion of the typical  sexual ""love affair"" gone bad. Without saying too much, you'll enjoy it if you like reading about a somewhat pathetic group of folks who can't seem to keep their pants on and are seemingly unrealistically unable to control their rage either."
I would recommend this suspenseful narrative to anyone in search of a good titillating drama.  Very unpredictable and a definite page turner.  Can't wait to compare and contrast the with the movie.  I look forward to definitely reading more by Paula Hawkins.
"Though the book, like a train, took a bit to get up to speed, I really liked where Paula went with this.  I found myself becoming attached to the 3 main characters and loved how their stories unfolded. The read is pretty simple, yet very enjoyable."
A bit confusing and difficult to follow towards the end of a predictable ending. Kept my interest most of the time. Excellent portrayal of the agonizing effects of alcohol on a lady unwilling to see the effects she experiences and the consequences.
"Quite readable and fast moving.  Strongly reminiscent of ""Gone Girl"".  Really liked Hawkins' devoice of telling the story from the viewpoints of the three female characters.  Have already recommended this to many fiends."
Great for seeing how wonderfully quick crazy turns into addiction turns into ruined LIVES. Thoroughly enjoyed it though but then I'm not an addict - by the grace of God! If you see yourself as a character in this book please please please seek professional help.
I had hesitated to read something that sounded boring (on the train all day?) but was surprised how much happens off of the train.  The writer is able to get the reader into the minds of some pretty emotionally challenged people.  My assumption is she has experienced many of her characters traits.  Interesting and moving.
A lot of people have compared this book to 'Gone Girl' and I can see the similarities. I thought the book was well written and kept you engaged. I have to say that none of the characters were particularly likeable although 'character likeability' is obviously not a requirement to determine if a book is worth reading. I would definitely recommend this for people who also enjoyed Gone Girl.
"I enjoyed reading this book even though halfway through I figured out the ""who dunnit"". I think everyone can identify someone they know similar to the main character. That one person who always seems to have some kind of issue and story going on that you just don't know whether to invest the energy of befriending. Told through the point of view of three women, it ties together well."
Truly awful.  The most clichéd piece of drivel I've ever read.  Waste of time. Six more words are required.  Ugh.
"This is not my favorite genre but was recommended by a friend. This book is fairly well written and I like the changes in point of view and points in time,  however the protagonist is made out to be too much of a victim for my taste and the attempts to divert the reader from figuring out who the killer is were disappointing and predictable. Several ancillary characters were poorly developed."
"It took me a while to get into the story but somehow I couldn't put it down for long. The need to know what happened on the night that the narrator keeps teasingly referring to was so strong. I don't want to say too much about the story because one of the greatest attractions of this book for me are all of the plot twists, so suffice it to say, it is well worth hanging in there. Your tenacity will be rewarded!"
"I didn't get interested in the book until halfway through. If you read enough books of this genre, the ending is predictable and you'll figure it out. I didn't care for the way it was written and it concentrated too much on the title characters drinking for my taste."
"I'm having great difficulty finishing this.  I brought it because it was highly recommended.  But what the ##### It's certainly not what I expected,.  given the choice I would not have bought it."
"After thousands of reviews there is no point in repeating the story.  I bought this as an audible book and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The book is narrated in the voices of the 3 female lead characters and the story is refreshingly different.  It may be more of a woman's book as my husband really didn't enjoy reading  this book and didn't finish it, it wasn't to his taste."
"This book was the best I have read all summer! It is the only book that I have read in my lifetime in less than 24 hours. It is nothing like Gone Girl! For any other reviews stating that it is hard to follow Rachel's thoughts, I disagree. I thought the alcoholic character in her was very realistic. I recommend this book to any adult wanting a fast, beautifully written summer read! Excellent!"
"I really tried to like this book, but I found the plot weak and the story horribly and painfully elongated by a drunk' s blackouts and unreliable memory. We are told that blackouts occur because no memory is created and then suddenly the drunk remembers again. Predictable ending even with the weak introduction of the red haired stranger. How did this book get such reviews? What a waste of reading time."
I absolutely loved this book. I was hooked the second I started it. Finished in about 12 hours. I couldn't put it down!!
"I wasted my time reading this book, even though it was a quick read.Perfect example of falling into the hype of ""critical acclaim"".  'Had' to read it ... But was very disappointed.I learned nothing and reading it made me very sad."
"This novel was compared in some reviews to Gone Girl, which got me hooked right away.  At first I thought it would never compare, especially as the story started out nicely enough but didn't snatch me up immediately.  As I read, though, I NEEDED to see what happened to each of the players in this drama.  Lots of twists and turns, which I love, as they all make sense in the storyline.  This one, too, would make a great movie."
Tedious and predictable story. I figured out who the bad guy was about half way through the book. I can't understand the great reviews.
"Intriguing until near the close.  The book's ending seemed rushed, contrived, forced ... ultimately uneventful and disappointing."
This was a riveting story.  What I appreciated most was the authors brilliant use of literary techniques to masterfully craft a narrative that was taught and tense from about page 50 on;  and she did it without cheating.  No Deus Ex Machina - no implausible explanations; just a tightly woven story that revealed its darkness in increments.
"The Girl On The Train is a very readable ""can't put it down"" book. Many of the feelings and observations of the main character are easy to identify with - it's hard to empathize completely with someone who has no self-esteem and continually sabotages herself. Yet she continues on because she has some knowledge deeply buried that is nagging at her. That is part of the twisty-turning fascination of the mystery."
"All 5 main characters--3 women and 2 men--are incredibly hapless.  Only believabla character is a minor one, Cathy the roomate of the ""heroine"".  Writing confusing because it jumps from person to persona as narrator and year to year..  Plot unlikely."
I was hoping this story was going to be great.....instead it dragged on and on.  I could not empathize with any of the women...very little real plot...no real character development...just wasted the download fee.
A page turner and  very suspenseful..I can hardly wait to see if the movie is as good as the book.
"One of the best reads I had ion a long time, could not put it down, loved all the twist and turns."
"I heard very good things about this book, and when I read I completely fell in love with it. I had my suspicions on who was the murderer and for the whole book i was going crazy trying to figure out who it was! Paula Hopkins is a wonderful writer."
"This whole book and it's characters are a hot mess. I've read a few reviews that compared it to Gone Girl, the only aspect of similarities that I can find is in the way that they both mess with your mind. The major differences being that one was well developed and not a rambling mess."
"I can't believe I read the whole book. It was so confusing I never knew what was going on.  If it becomes a movie maybe I will be able to understand it.  I am going to stick with my regular authors James Patterson, Lee Child, and Steven King."
"An excellent story and an great first person characterization of an alcoholic.  Everything that happened seemed realistic and intriguing and I couldn't put the book down.  The girl on the train seems headed for doom and you feel compelled to want to save her. Loved the end of the book as well.  Its a bit like Alfred Hitchcock's rear window, but with a girl that stalks her ex husband and their neighbor via passing by them on a train."
"Twisty turny...quite a ride. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Trying to say what it is that makes it such a page-turner is impossible for me, but it is definitely a book to put on your list. Such realistic characters in such unrealistic situations, but, at the same time...how the hell did they get there?  I loved it. I recommend it as a great story. A great read."
I honestly  don't read a lot but heard this was becoming a movie and decided  to give it a read and was definitely  not disappointed  with  this one. This book kept my attention  and kept me guessing the whole way through. I highly recommend  this  book  to anyone.
Book kept me in suspense. Great read highly recommend can't put they book downCan't wait to read second book
"Once I picked this book up, I could not put it down.  Hawkins is a brilliant writer of this unreliable narrator genre.  I enjoyed it much more than I did Gone Girl.  As a retired educator who worked mainly in Advanced Placement English teaching, I have to say that I cannot read a poorly written novel, and I have been looking for lighter but arresting material.  This fits the bill perfectly!  I want more and more.!"
I found the book hard to read and very uninteresting until the last 10% of the book and wound not recommend it
Great book was barely able to put it down. Let's see how well the movie gets everything right. .. ..
"I did enjoy this book, but it wasn't the best by any means. It was rather slow moving, which was intentional I believe. But it made it hard to get into and push through. Keep going though, it is a good read."
"It was not a predictable story and had a number of twists; this is what kept me reading the book.  I did not find the characters relatable or realistic. The alcoholism, the severe loss as a young girl and the self-interest of the three main women in the story are difficult to accept as believable past problems.  All the characters felt overly traumatized in relation to their pasts."
It was not my favorite book as I feel that the book could have conveyed values through a more discreet style.  There was a message that she was sending but the finishing lines of the book could have backed that up better.  It handled the drinking problem with an unusual style and physical abuse in a strange manner that made my skin crawl placing those that would be trustworthy into a questionable value in character.
This was the most annoying book I have ever read a complete waste...sorry I ever purchased it.  Too much going back and changing dates
"One of the best books I've read this year.  I loved the first person narration--by three different narrators.  The women's stories start at different points in time and converge at the end of the novel.  (Watch the narrator and dates on each chapter as you read.)  Perhaps the most original murder mystery I have ever read.  I would say more, but I don't want to give anything away!"
"couldn't put it down, I needed to know what would happened. Great book. The story itself is not super incredibly original but, it has some good unexpected twists and turns that keeps you engaged and most importantly, in suspense!! The writer did a great job with the characters and tying everything/everyone together. I would be very excited if this turns in to a movie."
"After reading so many positive reviews, I purchased The Girl on the Train.  Big mistake!  Miserable main character living a miserable life equals a miserable book. And the other characters weren't any better.  Always an optimist, I kept reading it hoping it would get better but by the time I got to the end, I didn't really care who did what to whom.  (Apologies to the author.)"
"I enjoyed everything about this book. The characters were interesting, the premise fascinating, and the descriptions vivid enough so that I could see what the girl on the train saw. When I read this, I had no idea that it would become the spectacular hit that it is. I just knew I thoroughly enjoyed it and couldn't put it down."
It literally takes 200 pages to get good. It's a repetitive and somewhat boring book the only thing that kept me going was to find out the ending. The women's stories aren't told in chronological order so it's confusing and they all sound like the same person. I did like the ending. It was an easy read on nights where I don't want to think and there's nothing on tv. It was ok. I
"While, I couldn't put this book down. I can't decide if I loved it or not. Kept me guessing and it had a few unexpected twists. At times very thought provoking. Do we see what we want to see? Or do our subjective thoughts about ourselves or others influence our version of reality? I'm not sure overall it was worth 4 stars, but I couldn't put the book down and it got me thinking."
"It started out really catching my interest but got repetitive pretty quickly. I get it.. She's a drunk. Aside from repeating the characters' flaws over and over, their development falls flat. None of the characters are likeable because we don't get to know them well enough. The ending fell flat because of the lack of character development. It's a good quick beach read though."
It had me from the fist several pages. The title captured my imagination initially and when I saw it was well reviewed I was curious. It was an interesting style and kept me coming back to it. I had little idea how it would come together and when I read the last pages I wanted more.
Engrossing from the beginning but then had some difficulty with time frame. Once I worked out the what was happening I was unable to put the book down. The characters were believable and variable. I had sympathy for Rachel and it was confronting to read  about her issues and how her mind worked and the resultant problems. The story was well constructed and thought provoking. A very good read.
"This story is written in a different way from many novels, and keeps you interested. The relationships of the characters are intertwined, and this keeps you guessing. There are dark parts in the story, and it has suspense. The fantasies of the girl riding the train are interesting, and it is surprising when she meets the people whom she has been watching from the train."
Great suspense!
"Girl On the Train captured me immediately. Listening to it on audible made it almost palpable, as though I was there watching from the window of the train and seeing what Rachel was seeing. Just when you think you've figured it out, you learn it's far more complicated."
"A very interesting book with characters you don't really engage with and yet you are kept in suspense, wondering what would happen next. Once I got started it was hard to put down since you kept wanting to see what would happen next and were often surprised.I would recommend this book to readers but be sure you have time to read since you won't want to put it down."
"Great read!  I wanted to read it prior to seeing the movie. I did have a pretty good idea who the murderer was about halfway through, and I was right, but it still offered many twists and turns to stay interesting to the end."
"The first 70-75% of the book was fantastic. I love that the main character is a drunk. The author brings the reader into the life of a horribly messed up person so one can understand her warped perspective, bad decisions, and motivations. It is eye opening, refreshing, and completely engrossing. I stayed up all night to read it. Sadly, the end was predictable for me. I suspected it in the middle. The end had the characters behaving in out of character ways. It wasn't a terrible ending, it just wasn't great - it was satisfactory. It disappointed me after such an excellent 3/4 read. Really great mystery novels are rare, though, and I would recommend this book."
"I can see why this book is such a hit. Pamela Hawkins is a very fine writer I will continue to follow. She has a great read on human nature and fills her characters quite surprisingly with endearing and not so endearing human gifts and flaws that weave into the plot development so cleverly, you hardly know which way the it will turn. I found it very hard to put down and read into the wee hours. She speaks in many voices, including the victim's voice which is a storytelling technique that works for me almost every time. Hawkins is a real master at pushing and pulling the reader forward and backward in time. I liked how it turned out. Enjoy!"
"An emotional story that kept me turning the pages late into the night. The brisk writing style of the author propelled the characters into an inevitable collision that shook their worlds. The struggles of the main character's alcoholism gave me insights into the heartbreaks and tragic consequences of a disease that affects so many people in our society. Overall, an excellent novel that I've already recommended to friends."
"A customer left this book behind in the waiting room where I work, I read about ten pages into the first chapter when she came back for it. I immediately bought it on Amazon! Suspenseful and gripping, now I can't wait to see the movie!"
"Interesting story, but I simply couldn't warm up to the character, whose deep depression and obsession with her ex-husband make for unpleasant reading. Characters don't have to be sympathetic, but all I felt for her was pity and exasperation, and that got old. The writing itself is unremarkable. The plot became more compelling about halfway through, but if I hadn't bought the book I wouldn't have read that far."
I picked this book on a whim.  The movie was just released and the previews looked interesting. So glad I did!  This was a well written book and I hated putting it down each night before bed.  Suspenseful...loved it!
I am giving only 4 stars because I feel towards the end the book became somewhat predictable. It was also much sadder than I'd anticipated. The pace of the book is fantastic. I read it in 2 days as it really draws you in.
"Very good mystery plot, to be sure but completely despicable characters. I ended up loathing not only the main character and her weak, self loathing and the enjoyment she gets from wallowing in it but I despised the other feature characters as well. Scott turns out violent and cold, Anna is so pleased with herself and self concerned I'm amazed she's capable of loving a child at all and the only decent guy gets very little time in the story.I've never disliked a primary character as much as I disliked Rachel in this book."
I enjoyed the pacing and character development as the story unfolded.  The story is told through three main characters' first person narrative.  I have been a little frustrated with other books written this way because there is one (or two) characters I find uninteresting or unrealistic and feel like I'm suffering through their narratives and tempted to skip them all together.  I was interested in the perspective of each character in this book to the end.  I read it in less than 48 hours - picking it up whenever I could find a spare moment.
"Great book. I thought it started a little slow, but it's all worth it for the ending. Always kept me guessing. I would definitely recommend this book to friends, and I can't wait to see it in theaters!"
I read this book in one day! I haven't done that in quite a while. I couldn't put it down! I was convinced that I knew who the villain was several times and each time I was wrong! Headed to find more Paula Hawkins novels!
"Fun read - it really kept my attention and pulled me into the story and had me wanting to know the characters. I liked that the story wasn't happening in a linear fashion... but sometimes I did have to look back at the chapter heading and see ""when"" something was happening. I read it on a Kindle, so it was a bit cumbersome going back and forth (the chapters are named ""Rachel"", ""Megan"" and ""Anna"" - over and over again, so it's easy to lose your place). I'm looking forward to a movie using this story!"
"It was a pretty good novel, not so great a mystery.there were only so many characters and the obvious choices of suspects are ruled out. The culprit becomes clear when all impossibilities are rationalized.I still enjoyed it."
"I'm having great difficulty finishing this.  I brought it because it was highly recommended.  But what the ##### It's certainly not what I expected,.  given the choice I would not have bought it."
"I understand the creativeness of the storyline, but it was just not my type of writing.  I found myself avoiding reading it, but being a compulsive reader, I would not put it away for another book- I was bound and determined to finish it.Maybe I just couldn't focus on the names. For a while i mistakenly thought that Rachel was delusional and was actually Meagan and Ann.  I was confused- maybe because of the Jason and Jess thing...Anyway, I am glad I finished, but sort of wished I hadn't started."
Excellent mystery of an etangled love story that kept me in suspese and actually made me gasp out loud at the finding of evidence.  I knew this would be a great book to read after seeing the previews for the movie and it was!
"If you liked gone girl, you will like this book. Unfortunately, if you have seen the trailers for the movie, then it's easy to figure out ""who did it""'I do recommend the book, like I wrote it, it is a good read."
"This one was interesting.  I'm not a huge mystery person but this was a bit like Gone Girl - it's also about the lives of the narrators and does a really good job of starting far out and slowing bringing the stories together in a web.  The main narrator Rachel, even with all her flaws, I was really rooting for her. And unlike many books, I really didn't know ""who did it"" until closer to the end.  Clever enough, with a deep enough story, to keep my interest all the way through.  Definitely worth a read, and the whole time I was reading it, I was thinking - this reads like a movie.  And low and behold, it's becoming one (hopefully better done than Gone Girl)."
"I honestly do not understand all the hype with this book, I predicted the ending in the beginning of the book.. And I was not surprised by it in the least. She paints a pretty picture, but it's a picture I've seen a thousand times."
It's depressing & graphic. Every male character is seen as abusive in some way. All 3 female characters' voices sound the same to me. The only one that differed a bit was Anna.  But if you past all that a great murder mystery!
"This book was amazing! I a little slow in the beginning from going back and forth between characters, but once the story starts to unfold it is quite the page turner! The only downfall is finding my next book that in comparable."
"Loved it! The beginning was very dark but soon weaved into a super suspenseful read - some mysteries have so many seemingly unrelated details that have to come together that you  reread previous pages- this was just the right mix of mystery, without being too complicated.  Can't  wait for the movie-"
"This was an OK read. Really, this book just made me feel VERY good about myself because the main character is a complete crazy person. She had so many issues and I just kept wondering what on Earth she was going to get herself into next. She really didn't know how to quit while she was ahead.  I could take or leave this book. If there was a sequel, I probably wouldn't read it."
The author has the main character do some pretty ridiculous and pathetic things. Almost unbelievable. Will probably make for a better movie when its more acceptable to do stupid s*** for dramatic effect.
"Did not know what to expect only knew about the book because of the movie. My book club decided to read it because  of the movie. Awesome read, suspense had my adrenaline going. I couldn't put th  book down I read it in 2 days."
"Honestly, I saw the movie trailer and wanted to read the book ahead of seeing it.  The book depicts Rachel and Megan as flawed, sympathetic people, but it never really had me on the edge of my beach chair.  I'm looking forward to the movie."
"Enjoyed the different perspectives, as the author switched from Rachel, to Anna, to Megan, in viewing how difficult life can be for people with significant personal problems, particularly attachment issues, arising from early childhood traumas.  Good exploration of the role of excessive alcohol consumption as a 'mind altering drug,' designed to avoid dealing with reality, and yet perpetuating continued dysfunction and unrealistic fantasizing.  Surprisingly realistic and uncomfortable portrayal of people's search for love in all the wrong places."
"The book was okay, from all of the hype I expected much more. I had the who dunnit figured out early on so the characters started to become annoying for being dumb. There are many books where the writing and plot are far more intriguing."
"The dates going back and forth are a bit confussing but its an enjoyable story, although Anna is a depressing character but you learn not to follow her footsteps and that gives you motivation to get the best out of youself."
"It started off slow, but was character building.  At first, I didn't realize that there were different characters telling the story and I was confused.  On the kindle, names are very lightly printed at the beginning of each chapter that alerts you that it's a new character story line....so be careful as to keeping characters straight if you are reading on a kindle. After I noticed that, the story was very good.  Very worth reading."
"This was a book I was a bit skeptical of given the stellar reviews and how much ""Gone Girl"" disappointed at its non-ending.  But The Girl on the Train is brilliant!  Great story, great suspense, great plot twists, greatly drawn characters.  And like a train that first pulls out of the station, it moves a little bit slow.  But pay attention, stay with it, and it then moves full speed into a dark and twisted mystery.  Hint:  Pay attention to the dates that appear at the beginning of each chapter.  It will help you once you catch on who is who and what is going on.  Read This Book!!!!"
A thriller. Couldnt put it down. Great Character development with unexpected satisfying ending. Highly recommended.Women who are seeking their inner strenghth will appreciate the main character.
"I enjoyed the multi-dimensional use of the train in this novel.  (The title of the book, the character of Rachel who is the 'girl on the train' and the views created from the moving train.)  That being said I thought the characters were undeveloped and unrealistic.  Also, unlike others, I did not see a need to compare this book to Flynn's ""Gone Girl"".  Worth the read to resolve the mysteries, but for me it was okay rather than great."
"Great story! Don't get discouraged if you're not understanding it in the beginning, it gets better. It can be difficult for some people to read from multiple perspectives, but this only makes the story more thrilling."
"It's got all the ingredients that make a fiction book great, drama, suspense, love and betrayal, many lies and deception and of course a murder mystery where all the clues lie within the main character who can't for the life of her remember what happened on that one particular night except for some tidbits that keep our eyes glued to the pages as she follows whatever smallish leads her memory is able to produce. Simply amazing! Hopefully it will become another great movie like Gone Girl, it certainly has tremendous potential!"
"It took me a few chapters to get into this book, but in the end, I truly enjoyed it.  I was not able to predict what happened in the end, which is a major plus.  The characters were well developed, and I could relate to them."
I found this book to b quite intriguing. As is said about some movies kept one on the edge of their seats till mystery was solved. Plus there seemed to be more than mysterious story to be answered too.
"Excellent story, well written. Unexpected ending and great characters. It goes to show that you cannot even trust your own shadow and that memories can also be lies or constructed as such. Five stars. Hoping the movie does it justice."
"Written from different points of view, this was a well written suspenseful, mystery that kept my attention and kept me guessing. Usually the books are better than the movie, so I'm not sure if I will watch the movie."
"Awesome book. I couldn't put the book down. I actually finished it in just 2 days. It kept me so interested, but the biggest surprise came at the end....when the book was over. Loved every minute of this book."
"It started out as what I might have considered ""hard to read"" but then got very interesting real quick.  I couldn't put it down.  I was so hooked.  I'm excited to see the movie.  With a suspense, maybe it can live up to the book.  :)"
"I really enjoyed reading this book. It was not hard to get in to. I am a rather slow reader but once I reached the halfway point, I read on my Kindle, I had a hard time putting it down. I can't wait to see how they did with the movie."
The book pulled me in from page 1. So much more suspenseful when most of the writing takes place in the character's minds. The plot intertwines in such a way that it keeps you guessing until the truth is finally revealed.
"Honestly it took a little bit for this to really get going I feel.  It did keep me guessing until the end about who the bad guy was which I enjoyed, not being able to easily figure everything out.  I also like that Rachel wasn't the easiest character to like, her actions at time made her appear pathetic and you just wanted to shake her.  It's not often you find an author that can write a character that you don't always like but still write a good book.  I also liked the alternating view points that let us into each women's world and let us see that Rachel and 'Jess' aren't that different.  All in all I would recommend this book, especially if you like thrillers that will keep you guessing until the end"
"I devoured this in one setting, I could not put it down. I can see the comparisons to Gone Girl due to the unreliable narrator aspect of this novel. Here there are three: Rachel the black out drunk, divorced hot mess; Anna, Rachel's ex's mistress and new wife; and Megan, the neighbor that Rachel has developed an idealized life, that has more than her own share of secrets. It took about 3/4 of the book for me to figure out who the real sociopath was in this novel, but it was an excellent journey. The writing is great, the story fast paced, and all three narrators are complex, multi-dimensional women. If you like thrillers or who-dunnits, you should definitely read this. I cannot wait for her next novel."
The book is an OK read if you want to pass the time or read what my wife calls 'dumb reads'. I'm not going to give to many spoilers but it's a very predictable book as well as accurate for describing your topical DV. The women in this novel are portrayed very weak which dissatisfied me the most.
"This novel , although very well written, is very upsetting.  The agony of the main character, not knowing if what she remembers is true or not, can cause some anxiety in the reader. Nevertheless, I recommend it."
Good book. Different than what I normally read and not what I expected but in a good way. It kept my interest all the way through. I find myself skimming through parts of a lot of books because they tend to go on and on about useless information like the color of the sky that day but not with this book. I was only a few chapters in when I recommended it to 2 friends who are reading it now. They both like it. I would be interested to read something else by this author.
"A real thriller, but also very dark and disturbing.  I think the author gave us a few too many subplots alongthe way a maybe some 'red-herring' clues as well (how did those piles of clothes get left by the traintracks.)  Good read all and all"
"Comparisons to Gone Girl are a bit generous, as this lacks Gillian Finn's knack for character development and twisted psychology.  Instead, it's more of a Lifetime movie thriller. It eventually becomes a page turner (even if experienced mystery readers see the finale coming from quite a way out)...but overall, I found myself thinking of our protagonist as unbearably weak and the portrayal of male characters to be misandrist.  (At their best narcissistic and self-serving - at worst, which was common, controlling and violent.)  Fine for a plane ride or the beach, but don't get mislead by the flattering praise into thinking this novel will stay with you."
"This would be a good airplane book.  About 35 pages into it, I considered quitting.  Each chapter has the name of the character whose perspective is described in that chapter, which is necessary because the voices of the characters all blur together.  More than once I had to check the first page of the chapter to be sure who I was reading about.  However, since my book group chose it, I kept reading.  It is a compelling story in many ways, and the plot twists at the end are clever.  So, if you find yourself needing something that will hold your attention, it could be worthwhile.  If you want something gripping and very well written, read Susan Hill's Serraillier, which is first rate."
"Very interesting read. Didn't go where I thought it was going to, which is actually unusual for me. I'm hesitant to say more because I don't want to give anything away. But if you enjoy books that make you think, try this one."
"Confusing at first, but one has to examine the date and narrator at the head of each chapter, and keep the participants and relationship in mind.  PS:  The movie does an excellent job of capturing the story in 90 minutes!"
"I was intrigued with the storyline because it kept me guessing until the end. However, I just was not enjoying the narrative. It seemed to lack, for a better word, intensity.  It was like watching a  great play with poor acting."
"This book reads like a train:  beginning slowly without much fanfare, building speed as it rocks along, and then finishing full steam ahead to the conclusion. I was not sure I liked the main character--a good word to describe her would be ""loser.""  Yet as the book moved along, I found myself more and more drawn to her. This book is full of liars, and the surprising plot hinges on ""Whom do I believe?""  My opinion shifted throughout the book, and I wasn't sure of the truth-teller until the very end.  I can guarantee that the book will keep you engaged.  I look forward to more books from this author."
My alarm goes off during the workweek at 4:30 a.m. and there have been plenty of mornings since I started this novel when my eyes were bleary from late nights.  A definite thriller and I look forward to reading more from Paula Hawkins.
"This was a nice distraction from a pretty heavy course I am taking.  It held my attention and was told from point of view of main character, a woman with an alcohol problem who was getting on my nerves a bit because she couldn't shake her alcohol habit and was wallowing in loss of husband for about the whole book.  Like a train ride it has some interesting twists and was a nice light summer read.  It is a mystery and I was surprised at the end but then I said, hmmm, there were a lot of suspicious things about this character.  I liked it a lot."
"I really did like this book and would recommend it.  I am writing this review a bit late as I read the book awhile ago.  I think this book had surprises.  While the main character struggled with her alcoholism, made bad decisions, she certainly was astute at the end.  So review short but wanted to share a worth while read."
"It's obvious why this book has been #1 on the Best Seller list for some time.  It's a fast page turning old fashioned mystery that doesn't divulge the murderer until the end. The characters are well defined, but I found the main character hard to empathize with.  How could someone so compassionate, dedicated and caring be so stupid?  Yet I would recommend it, as it is entertaining."
"Was engaged from the first page on; I was involved in what was happening to the characters and how their viewpoints impacted their lives and others; I like how all the characters were connected; however, I was frustrated that all the women were flawed. I like having a character who I am hoping will succeed and grow. I look forward to reading other books by this author."
"Wow!  This was a very different, yet very powerful book. You are constantly guessing who ""did it"". There are just lots of twists and turns. The adage, ""Things are seldom as they appear to outsiders.""  Paula Hawkins' writing style is truly unique."
"I liked that this book was one I just couldn't put down. Great characters, flawed and real. A good read."
i was a little leery about reading this as its not something i normally read but once i started i couldnt stop. while the main character is sort of annoying and can be aggrivating the story does hold you captive and i rather enjoyed reading it. the plot twist is totally unexpected which makes it even better. you dont really see it coming until the main character does.
"Pretty good read, but I did work the end out ahead of time.  It is told from several different perspectives which made it a bit more dynamic.  Good mystery read."
"The Girl on the Train was such a good read! Although I did get lost at first when reading the alternating characters stories, Paula Hawkins does a great job of tying things together and unfolding the plot. I never expected the ending and I was deeply pleased with this book! I was drawn in from the moment I began reading. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys mystery/thrillers!"
"The twist(s) was good, but the build up was slow, slow, slow. The protagonist is unsympathetic, but as an alcoholic I suppose that was the intent. Keep reading despite the plodding pace and mewling main character -- the ending is properly satisfying."
"The part that I took away from this novel and that stuck with me is the perspective of an alcoholic's attraction and addiction to alcohol. That aspect was done fairly well.  The plot/story line was predictable, no surprises for me.  Characters were not that well-developed which contributed to the predictability of the story.  I do not understand why it was no.1 on the best seller list, not that great."
Found the book to be a struggle and was glad when I finished it.  Following the lead character (Rachel) was exhausting with her alcohol problems. The author left out some answers to questions that I had in my mind:  who tipped the police about human remains buried in the garden?  What eventually happened to Scott and Anna?Would not recommend this book to any of my book reading friends.
"the thing is, it is more about how jealous and an alcoholic the main character was than actually the story. You will read about how she HATES her ex's wife and how disgusting the character was than know about what's the story really is.For me, it was TOO dark, I highly don't recommend this :( watch the movie instead when it comes out, it will probably be bad too."
I had no expectations or information on the novel content when I bought it.  I kept reading it although I found it repetitive and slow at times.  The characters were well developed.  All were unlikeable.  I figured out the plot two thirds through but again kept reading.  I would compare it to Gone Girl which I read some time ago I found that a more interesting and faster paced read. But thinking about it there was a similarity to the style in which is was written may have been what made me less impressed with this novel.
If you like thrillers or crime stories this will be a good choice for you. One of the better books I've read. Typically I go for non fiction but this was a very entertaining book. Now I want to see the movie!
"I thought the narration was first person for 4 or 5 chapters so I felt the narrator was multiple personalities. I finally realizedthere were several narrators, started the book over, and it became a fascinating and interesting  book. Complex and flawed(real) people who become attractive as they develop (all but one). A great read."
A good story once you got used to the style. It was enjoyable but predictable. I figured out the ending long before the story itself was even close to getting there. It was compelling though and worth the read. A few hours in a single sitting.
"One needs to stay with the book and keep the time scales in your mind to become fully committed. In essence it is an old style who dunnit with many twists and turns and generally with characters that you will never fall in love with. Pity will be an emotion which you may feel for the central character since many women end up in this type of scenario. Of course most women will not become involved in a murder hunt.There are some characters, who,  while necessary to enhance some scenes and play minor parts, are not fully developed even though one feels that somehow they will expand to have a bigger role in the plot.Again maybe I missed something along the way."
"Loved the writing style, it certainly keeps you on the edge. I figured who done it the last time Rachel spoke to the red headed guy and that Tom was with Megan, not Anne. But the author keeps you in the dark just enough to keep you needing to k ow more."
"I was not able to put this down. The story twisted and turned through the eyes of a depressed alcoholic but an unexpectedly interesting character,  well written and although a predictable ending it feels appropriate."
"Overall, I really liked this book and understand all of its praise. I did, however, find myself slogging through the middle where it seemed to get repetitive. It was easy to get into the characters and the story and for the first 1/3 I was riveted. I got through a few slow parts and then felt that it all came together well in the end. Nice writing and a great story."
"I did enjoy the way the author wrote the book although I'd have to glance back at times to see who I was reading about. However, I must admit this was the first novel I've read in a long time where I did not like even one character."
Both the book and the movie held my interest which is saying something with modern literature.
This book and its characters totally consumed me! I needed to know what happened and couldn't stop turning the pages until I reached the end. Paula Hawkins does a very fine job of creating her characters and a very enthralling story line in her first novel. This book had been highly recommended in two magazines that I subscribe to and now I can see why. There are no dull moments from the beginning to the last page of this book!
"This book was good but... I had it all figured out WAY before the author anted me too. The ""twist"" wasn't a shock at all. I would have gave 5 stars if the whole book was not so easy to figure out. I want to read something that I don't figure til I'm supposed to"
Great novel  kept me involved could  not put it down  had no idea how it was going good to end
It was a quick read that kept your interest to a point but there are absolutely no endearing characters in the book.  Every person in the story has issues.  There is not one character to route for.  They are a cast of characters with no morals.  Unlike a thriller like Gone Girl where you could get behind someone this just didn't do it for me. Just bad people doing bad things to each other.
"Definitely an easy read and one of those suspense books that make you want to keep reading.Somewhat far fetched but then again - it's fiction.Other readers compared it to ""Gone Girl"", wouldn't quite agree but still, really good story. You end up in a love - hate relationship with most of the characters. Ending is not necessarily predictable.I do recommend the book and author!"
"This is definitely the worst book I have ever read.  Cannot believe it is on the top of the best sellers list.  Do people really like reading about such sick people?  Awful, awful."
"At first I had trouble keeping the characters clear......I had to keep back-tracking to see which person the next chapter was about.  Once I had that under control, the book is a great read - not what I expected at all!  Towards the end I figured out the 'who done it' but loved the style of this book.  Will I read this book again?  YES, for sure!  If you are looking for a great read - this is it!"
.  Obviously written by someone in recovery.drinking passages tedious.  Idea regarding complicated relationships interesting.probably has a ready made audience by word of mouth. Does anyone know how to write about somethingOther than dysfunction other than dysfunction.
"I was surprised by how much I liked this novel. Very strange in the beginning, going back and forth. However, the more I read, the more I was pulled in. Scott was a complete jerk, but so was Megan. Rachel is just a poor lost soul. Anna, although I didn't like her, at least came through. The only character I felt was okay was the psychiatrist. Wouldn't really recommend"
"Just finished this.  Starts out great, grabs your attention, interesting plot, and then... it turns into a chick book.  The three female characters are the Queens of Bad Decisions.  Weepy, whiney, drifting, self-absorbed and indulged.  But the world owes them something!  Validation?  Entitlement?  A career?  A man?  Wealth?  Who knows?  They don't know either and by the end of the book you could care less.This is being pitched as another ""Gone Girl"".  It's not even close.  This is not a suspense thriller.  The ending was predictable and ridiculous.  The two stars are for the first half of the book.  After that you're on your own."
"The beginning of the book was awesome. I was hooked, but as the plot started to untwist I lost a little interest. I still finished it through but felt it went a little too ""lifetime movie"" for my taste."
Started out a little slow and built up the suspense through the characters revealing behind the curtain reality! Became more and more of a page turner as I read on. Unexpected twists and turns near the end.  Overall I enjoyed this book
"The only reason I didn't give this book a five is that it got tiresome living inside the head of the girl on the train. Having said that, it is definitely with the read. It all fits together beautifully in the end."
"While the plot is fantastic and engaging, I genuinely enjoyed this book for the very strange reason that I didn’t feel compelled to love (or even like) the characters. Their flaws can be maddening, but it drew me into the story as a whole as opposed to siding with a single character as we so often do. I can’t remember the last time I felt genuine frustration with a character (as opposed to the plot or writing) like I did while reading this, but it made it hard to put down. It’s truly amazing storytelling that we don’t get enough of these days!"
I wanted to read the book before the movie came out. It was an easy and enjoyable read! I also enjoyed how the author's strike of writing. I recommend this you anyone looking to read something that will keep you guessing until the very end.
At first I wanted the book to move faster. But as soon as I got into it  I could not put it down. So many twists and turns. I thought I had it figured out and was pretty shocked at the ending. Great psychological read. Highly recommend.
"Very good book, keeps you guessing! One of those books that you start reading an  don't want to put down. I love  nurse  mystery books an  this is one I would recommend to someone who also likes them."
"I decided to give this book a shot since it's coming out as a film soon. I went in to it knowing nothing about it-which I think was a good way to go. I didn't read a summary, any reviews, just hoped my friend made a good recommendation. I would definitely recommend it. Give it a shot."
"First time reading a novel by this author.  The pace and plot of this story was something I like when I'm reading a mystery.  Just enough description and dialogue to keep me turning the pages.  I usually skip over some paragraphs if the author gets too descriptive, I don't need a whole page of adjectives about wardrobe or a room, but this novel I read every word.  This story flipped back and forth between characters and pass and present, but it was not difficult to follow.  I would recommend this to readers who like mysteries."
Not sure what others liked about this book. I kept waiting for the thrill to begin. Very slow until the final few chapters.
"At first I was a little put off my Rachel and her alcoholism but as the story progressed realized it was vital to the story and definitely wouldn't be real if she just ""woke up and got her sh*t straight"". Telling the story from the perspective of each woman in the book made you wonder who was telling the truth and who told what they wanted to see. Very suspenseful and kept me on the edge until the end. Excellent writing."
"If one has a better attention span than I, it shouldn't be a problem alternating among characters.  I, however, tend to ignore chapter headings, but it is critical in this book to know who is narrating.  I found this to be a very interesting story with good character development, a smooth and attention-getting plot, and captivating until the end.  I would recommend it without reservation."
Looking forward to seeing the movie after reading.  It keep my interest. Many complex and dysfunctional characters.
"Being a mother of two, wife and employed full time, there just doesn't seem to be a long enough period of time to stay focused on a good book. Except this book, I found time and read it in a month rather than a year. What a great page turner!"
What an awesome book!I was hooked from the beginning very easy read and lots of twist and turns and the drama of it all was great!I hear the movie is just as good as the book looking forward to watching the characters come to life!
"I felt the story was slow to start but once Rachel started putting a few pieces together about what happened that night, I couldn't put it down! Slightly dark and twisted with many characters battling various demons. Overall, I enjoyed the book."
"While some plot points stretched credibility a bit, this did not really matter very much in the long run. This is a great read. Told from three different viewpoints, the central mystery unfolds through first person testimony of the participants. Never dull."
This was a really excellent book. I could barely put it down. The author did an excellent job of writing the characters' feelings and thoughts in a way where I easily identified with them and was able to feel their perspective like it was my own. Definitely a must read.
"Alcoholics, sociopaths, narcissists, psychopaths, pseudo psychologist. The supply of hopeless and helpless people never runs out.One of the least entertaining and most irritating books I have read since Eat, Pray, Love or Gone Girl...all the same genre."
"A great read!  Kept me guessing till the end.  Will have to say, I was shocked who the guilty person was.I can see why this book has stayed on the Best Seller list so long.I highly recommend this book.  Hope you will enjoy it as much as I did."
"I read this on vacation, Okay, truth be told the lady next to me on the plane was reading it on her tablet and I started reading along with her (boy was she ever a SLOW reader) anyway I had to purchase to my kindle as the flight was too short (for her) to finish it. I enjoyed reading the book, it was different and I was on vacation looking for entertainment."
"The story was intentionally confusing, but the payoff was not really worth the effort.  The writing style was interesting, but it felt almost like a less polished version of ""Memento"".  It's good airport reading."
"I am not a fan of this book. The characters fit into negative gender-based roles. The women are weak, insecure, and depend upon men for validation. The men are violent and controlling. The writing is not terrible, but it is a very easy read. I was able to finish the book in two days. You can skim right through and not miss much. So overall, very poor character development with not much substance."
"Hawkins's writing is kind of amateurish, but the story itself is very compelling and suspenseful. I couldn't put it down. Pardon the cliché, but it's true; I couldn't wait until I could read it next. Rachel is a fascinating character, and the unpredictability of her self-destructive behavior is what drew me in the most. Fans of Gillian Flynn will enjoy this read, but prepare for a weaker writing style than Gone Girl or any other of Flynn's works."
"It took me awhile to figure out that each chapter was a different character talking.  The book is good, I still want to see the movie, even with my 3-star rating.  At some point I got tired of her drinking and forgetfulness."
Enjoyed this book on a long flight home from London back to the US.  I liked it because having just visited London it was cool to read about things I had just seen in person.  I liked the book and had a couple of good twists I didn't expect!  I enjoyed it and finished the whole thing on the flight home!
The Girl on the Train is written in a style of chapters titled by characters in the novel. (This is not my favorite style) so I approached the first few chapters with passive attention. As I got into the book the characters drew me in. The author held the solution to the crime until the end. Characters were well developed and one could relate to their characteristics. I enjoyed the book and recommend it if you like mysteries that end when it ends.
"the first part where subject is drinking all the time was tiresome, am trying to get into it only because it is a best seller, but I don't think it deserves all the accolades it received.  I feel the author knows someone who published it."
"I wonder if other kindle readers have the same frustration as I do reading a book like this on the Kindle. Each chapter has a date and year. I don't remember what the date was on the last chapter, and in order to find out, I have to first make note of where I am in the book, GO TO the beginning, then GO TO the table of contents and see what the last chapter was titled. Way to much work for me. Any suggestions?? Is there a place where books are rated to not read on a kindle?"
"This is my thought as I read the last paragraph:  ""Wow, this book stays with you man"".Haunting, thought provoking and intense - a real who did it and why.  And those questions answered will make you make you cry and gasp. They did me anyway - I didn't like any of the characters (LOL), but I get it - sort of.  Never met people quite like this and hopefully never will!  Sign of a good author - bravo!"
"The book reminded me in some way of ""Gone Girl"" another story with unlikable characters.  I found this cast of characters complex but not people I would like to know.  The chapter shift of characters was confusing at times and difficult to move easily from one to another.  Not highly recommended, but a fast read."
The book captured my attention for the first 35 pages but then I got bored with the characters and how they kept making stupid mistakes with their lives. I did a lot of skimming to finish the book. Do not recommend this book and probably won't bother seeing the movie.
This book was well written and I couldn't put it down!  It was suspenseful and despite the fact that the characters weren't depicted in the best light and I think the author could have done a better job with character analysis - I did appreciate the vivid descriptions and colorful roles they played throughout the novel.A nice twist and I liked how everything unfolded.
I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I slowed down towards the end because I just didn't want it to end.  I only read it because I wanted to before seeing the movie and I am so glad that I did. I will definitely be watching for what this author releases next.
"The Girl On The Train was a nice beach read. I had high expectations when I heard Stephen King gave it glowing reviews. I didn't LOVE it, but it did interest me enough to read it in about two days. I do like the current trend of flawed main characters, and it did keep me guessing until the end. I would recommend it to anyone who is into the ""Gone Girl"" genre."
"The narrative made the story interesting, but many characters were underdeveloped. The twist was predictable, but once there was revelation the story closed without fulfilment.  Worth the effort.  I think the movie will be grand, but don't read the story first."
"Intriguing character development, well written.  You could sympathize and imagine yourself as one of the characters.  Though I figured out the ending it didn't ruin the story , which was chilling and believable.  Kept my interest throughout."
"I liked the character development of each woman in the labeled chapters. The men were a little more vague but that helped sustain the mystery. I did guess ""who done it"" correctly about half way through but the ""why"" was harder to figure out. Even with knowing, it still held the suspense and my interest. I'm undecided about how it ends. I will probably go back and read the last two chapters."
"I didn't particularly like The Girl On the Train, although it kept me reading to see what might happen in what was a not very satisfactory end. I didn't like it because I am absolutely sick and tired of reading novels with totally dysfunctional characters. I know a lot of people are dysfunctional in the real world: I just don't find it enlightening or entertaining to read about them. Nola Shelley."
"The book starts out slow, sometimes painfully slow, going through the main character's thoughts & struggle with alcoholism. The book is reminiscent of Gone Girl, only Gone Girl wasn't as slow; it was also more twisted than this book. Overall a decent one time read."
"While I might normally give this book 4 stars, I'm giving an extra star due to the well-developed characters. The author has the courage to delve to the darkest places of people, in all characters. It is in that darkness that even a small flicker of light can be seen and even nourished. A great mystery read with strong and interesting female characters. Highly recommended."
The beginning was a little difficult to grasp being that its a different kind of read that im used to but once i dug into it i thoroughly enjoyed it!
"When I first started the Girl on the Train, I thought I wouldn't  like it because it was written in  first person, but boy was I mistaken . Each page I turned took me deeper into this , suspense filled  thriller . Paula Hawkins does not disappoint , a must read!"
"Recommended by a friend and having seen it all over book stores etc, I figured I'd give this book a try.  It seemed a little hard to get into but having persevered it is sustaining my interest but I would not call it a page turner.  Both the violence and the sexual content are inferred not in your face.  It is just somewhat a contorted story seemingly just because."
"Intriguing characters and story that hold your attention but have a quirky common thread. This story could be placed anywhere where commuter trains, buses, trolleys feature into daily lives. There is a observed (watchful sense of possession) and longing by Rachel that makes the reader wonder about her sanity. is she stable? She needs help! Anna what a sorry piece on work. Enjoy!"
"I found the first half of this book to be very compelling and suspenseful...a real page-turner. But mid-way through, as more was revealed about each character, I found myself not wanting to read this book or just read a few pages at a time. The main character Rachel, was a mess, but in an intriguing, unique sort of way. But in the end I found all the characters to be despicable!"
"After seeing the reviews on the Today show, I expected more than this book delivered. It was disappointing, at best."
"I did not enjoy it as much as I expected to.  I found the heroine to be weak and uninspiring.  I could not see much hope for her, as she let her failed marriage define her life, and in spite of urging from  those around her, she made no effort to change the destructive path of her behavior."
"I read when I go to bed and this one put me right out.  The book starts very slowly, but I kept reading trying to understand how riding back and forth on a train could develop into a story.  Very dark characters that are difficult to identify with.  I finished it, but was less than satisfied."
I very much enjoyed the book.  There were twists and turns enough for anyone.  Every time I thought I had it figured out. something else would happen.  I enjoyed it and would recommend it.
"I had trouble putting this book down.  At first, it was hard to follow with the different view points, but once I figured out the flow, it was riveting.  It leads you down one road only to push you down another at the end."
"This book was fast paced and well written. Told from the point of view of three different women, it was engaging and hard to put down. I would recommend it to those who enjoy psychological thrillers in the style of a Hitchcock story."
This novel follows an alcoholic woman struggling with her broken life that is the result of her drinking. I found the vivid and real portrayal of feelings and situations an alcoholic many times finds themselves in the best feature in the writing. There is a little suspense following a character's murder and a who done it story line. I gave this novel 3 stars because it entertained me however did not captivate me.
"I found this book to be boring, confusing and contrived. A story mainly about alcoholism and how it can destroy people's lives. The women in this story are all dealing with some kind of loss and they all seem to be searching for something but they don't know what it is. The author did not make me feel sympathetic towards these women and at times I felt I was wasting my time reading this book."
"It creeps up on the reader, this book. You drift along as if you were on a train, stopping at the odd signal, and then suddenly you realise that the structure is much more complicated. The book is written from two directions, designed to meet in the middle. And that the narrators are the three woman central to the plot, including the victim, who is still there at the end having died much earlier. No men's voices, no police in strains. It is occasionally bland, there are gaps, but as the train speeds up so does the story, 'till you can't wait to confirm what is starting to become evident. Oh yes, this may be called a page-turner!"
"For the first time in ages a book with a new approach has come along and I have been captivated. The protagonist is a mess, breaks all the rules, but is so sadly real you just can't turn away. I bought the book from an Amazon seller, willing to give it a try. Now I tell all of my friends who read about it."
"What Alfred Hitchcock does with camera pans Paula Hawkins does with words in this psychological thriller of character development. If you were a fan of ""Gone Girl,"" you will be a fan of ""The Girl on the Train."""
The novel left me depressed and in a bad mood. I can understand the way it is built but I feel it insists too much on the situation of the main character and it is very confusing for the reader. Maybe it pleases some readers but not me. I made an effort to finish it.
"Really enjoyed this book, especially the way the author played with time.  I thought the arc of the villain was a little too quick, which made the ending somewhat predictable, but overall, I totally enjoyed this book."
"Since the moment I started it, I could hardly stop.  I finished it in four days (and I went to work and everything) It is very original, the characters are well developed and you know there is something more, but it is hidden very deep.  Some things are difficult to believe, but you will dont care.  The story is interesting, and it has plot twists all the time.  My feelings for the characters changed all the time, sometimes I understood and supported them, sometimes I got very annoyed with them.  Rachel, the girl on the train, is a real mess, and sometimes you will want to punch her!  Read it, you will not regret!!"
"This book is a certified page turner. The story revolves around 3 women who all share the same life but seem to be at different points in it. Anna the former mistress turned happy housewife who is struggling to convince herself that the family life is everything she needs. Megan, the tamed runaway converted into a suburban slave who will do anything to feel the freedom of her former life. Then Rachel who spends her time drifting between a bottle and her past life, unable to move past her wine and gin induced purgatory.While the writing and the ending could have used some more thought it was overall an entertaining and easy read."
"It was a different but interesting read. People will never operate as you want, as you envision them, or even operate in their own best interest. Sometimes you think that you can separate the good from the bad but not in this book."
"I purchased this book based on a pre-release review I read in a newsletter. It was downloaded to my Kindle on the release day and I started it soon after. The beginning was slow. It didn't hook me at all. I put it down and only came back to it a couple of weeks later when I didn't have anything else to read.I am glad I did, too. This was a good story. It has been compared to ""Gone Girl"", something I disagree with. It is better than ""Gone Girl"". At least ""The Girl On The Train"" didn't leave me feeling cheated and Rachael was a sympathetic (if somewhat messy) narrator.Stick with the book through the first twenty or so pages. You'll be glad you did."
"I was intrigued by this novel, especially the manner by which it was organized and told. The characters were very well developed, and their problems and idiosyncrasies offer great insight into their thoughts and behaviors. I must say I found this a somewhat difficult read, though."
"It took a while to get into this book; I found it very depressing initially and put it aside, but picked it up again later and did finish it.While I certainly would not categorise ""The Girl on the Train"" as a must-read book, it is quite entertaining and does have a couple of suspenseful moments; I was quite surprised by the ending.  It is rather more a borrow from the library or a friend book, than must-buy to read again.  Having said that, it is probably not a bad way to spend a rainy Sunday afternoon."
This was such a great book! I love murder mysteries and this checked all of my boxes. I couldn't put it down and even listened to it on tape while I was driving to and from work because I was so hooked! Can't wait for the movie!
"I tried liking this book, all the reviews made me want to like it.  I tried reading it, I usually don't care for 1st person books, I tried listening to it, I had to turn it off after the 2nd chapter.  It may get better but it was so slow and boring for me the first two chapters.  I'm sure there will be a movie coming out with all the reviews but I will not be seeing it."
"I read this book on my Kindle, and unfortunately, the chapters were headed in very light printing. I didn't notice the headings at first, and was very confused. When I finally realized that the order of events kept jumping forward and backward and from person to person, I figured it out (FINALLY!) Didn't mind reading chapters about each person, but the way the order of events was presented was not my favorite way to read a book. Other than that, I kind of liked it.....I think if I read it again, I will like it better!"
The older I get the more difficult it is to find something that holds my interest .  A psychological love triangle that goes beyond what is happening into why it is happening.  Lots of  twists and turns that you  see coming but are still startled and shocked when it happens.  Spending time inside the minds of the main characters you begin to see parts of yourself...and may even gain some insight into how you have gotten to where you are in life.  Good old fashioned read.
"Can I put 3.5 stars?I DID like this book. It's good. It pulls you in. It's entertaining and you feel for the main character.I was a little surprised at just how many positive reviews it received because the quality of the writing belonged more in the genre of pop culture quick fiction. Which, I guess that's exactly what that book is.As for the deeper subject matter of alcoholism it does a nice job of showing the reader who is unfamiliar with that struggle what it looks like inside the mind of a woman who ended up there slowly and as a result of grief."
"The first two-thirds of the book were a cross between tedious and enticing. The detailed experiences of the three women and their inner turmoil left me drained, and questioning why I kept plodding through the pages of these screwed up lives. At the same time, I didn't want to take a chance that I'd miss a clue so I'd ""chew"" on every word thinking it's got to reveal something I will need to know to help solve the mystery. The last third of the book proved to be a downhill slide where I no longer had to work at analyzing content and just got to enjoy how all the loose ends cleanly wove together. I'm glad I stuck with it!"
"Loved book. Can't wait for movie, but understand that it is America not London. Looks like from tidbits it's a big White House she is looking at, don't know if I will like that either. Will make judgment after I see the movie."
Wow!  What a great story with so many twists and turns....I couldn't put it down!!! and spent a couple of afternoons sitting outside with my dog who wanted to go in and I was so into the story ...he was out longer than he expected.  The story kept me intrigued to the very end....my kind of book....
"I thought the plot built way too slowly. It felt like it was being purposely stretched to fill some kind of page quota. However, it is well written to fit the main character and the angles move together simultaneously from the edges to the center of a very interesting spider web."
"This book is as addicting as advertised, but I found almost every character unappealing. The prose is simple, if uninspiring. The two books I'd compare it to are Gone Girl (which is more clever) and Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter (which has more spectacular writing).  For all that, I had to deduct one star - but again, it _is_ an addicting read; I finished it inside 24 hours...."
"The well constructed, intricately stitched plot keeps you reading ""The Girl on the Train"" through as fast as you can. I have some quibbles, though. Not being a mystery reader, my criticism maybe unfair. Maybe it is acceptable for readers of the genre to put up with unimaginative prose and cardboard characters, but I found the three first-person narratives indistinguishable in voice. I needed to look at the headings to see who was talking."
"Not one character in this book is likeable.  The protagonist is a raging drunk; her roommate is an enabler and a push over; her ex is a cheater/murderer; his new wife is an aggressive bitch who is out for herself; the victim is willing to be taken care of by her husband but not willing to commit to him; she has no redeem qualities, and her husband is a physical and emotional bully, which may say much about the author--she doesn't like anyone."
"It took some getting used to, going forward and backwards in time. Once you start to make your own conclusions, it's hard to stop reading! And the actual conclusion is not what you expect, which to me is the best part!"
"Great thriller and an easy read. Although the ending was not a huge shock to me, it was quite suspenseful. The characters were interesting. Very well written and I would recommend to anyone who enjoys this type of book!"
"Much more of a thriller than I expected it to be. The characters are realistic and there are some u usual twists...the author throws in a few red herrings that lead to other possible suspects. It was a very fast read, the writing was solid and the dialogue was natural.. This is a story where everyone has some kind of problem, and everyone suspects someone else. It is a great book to take on a trip. The chapters aren't overly long so it's easy to stop and come back to it later. Don't make assumptions and don't overthink it and you'll enjoy riding along with The Girl on the Train."
"Finished this book in 2 days of almost non stop reading. Told by an alcoholic, rejected ex- wife, Rachel, the story and the solution to a murder are revealed through Rachel's obsessive watching from the train she takes each day to and from London. Two other women (Anna & Megan) also narrate their thoughts and struggles as they seek love & family. As Rachel tries to remember what happened on a Saturday in July when she blacked out after a drinking binge, the reader is kept guessing as murder suspects keep changing. A great read - very engrossing!"
"Well written with believable characters, all of which are flawed. And those who lie when they don't have to lie should be the most feared of all. The story is excellent and one of the best I've read this year."
"It started a bit sad, and I almost quit reading it as I was looking for something to grab me quick and keep my interest because my ""reading for fun"" time was limited, but I kept with it and it was worth it!  Very entertaining."
All the characters were so unlikable. And the plot was slow and then finished up abruptly like the author had a deadline and wanted to move on to her next project. I don't understand why this book is a hit and a motion picture.
Really liked the atmosphere and didn't expect the ending.  Very good reading. Even if I read a lot of these I really enjoyed the story. Don't understand the bad critics about the book as I read 10 in a row and 50 % of them disappointed me. Not this one.
"I finished this book in two days. This was a good read. The plot was engaging and the characters are well written, although not very likeable. While the mystery may not shock or surprise you, it will keep you thoroughly entertained."
"Just when you think ""why has this book been on the bestseller list for weeks"" and ""why am I reading a book about a woman who is traveling back and forth on a train and observing what she sees,"" suddenly you are sucked into an unfolding drama, and you don't want to put down the book. Paula Hawkins has masterfully unfolded the facts, the beliefs, the interpretations, and the misinterpretations of the characters."
I found this book to be full if twists and turns that I did not want to put it down. I enjoyed the storyline and the characters. Each character I could imagine in my head and get to know as the story unfolded.Glad we chose this book for our bookclub. Now we get to discuss!
This novel kept me on my toes and was thrilling from one chapter to the next. There was never a dull moment with any turn of the page. I loved it and am excited to see how the movie turns out but I can already tell the book is way better!!
Intriguing story told about a gal and her old neighborhood as she looks at it from the train. Can't wait to see the movie.
"The main character is clearly an alcoholic and the author's insight about alcoholism is accurate.  However, she did not capture the true reality of the disease and did not show how the one thing an alcoholic wants to do is to stay sober and have the compulsion to drink lifted.  The book was also too long for the story being told.  There was also nothing redeeming about the end of the story"
"This book was a facebook recommendation & I must say, a great recommendation it was!!! The characters were pathetic, devious, calculating, weak, love lost......... I'm not usually drawn to stories like this, but it's told so wonderfully & interestingly that I couldn't put it down!  There is so much of the feelings we all experience in the best & worst of times that I couldn't help but be invested in these ""people""."
This book is quite possibly one of the greatest books I have ever read. It is extremely well written and contains a complex and riveting plot. I would absolutely recommended this book to my friends!
"GOod first novel, but left dissappointed and the read itself was overly contrived. Will be curious as to how they handle it in the movie..."
I couldn't stop reading late into the night. There was a new twist around every corner. I felt I had the entire ending figured out and suddenly I was thrown for a loop. Such a great mystery. I'll not find another book this satisfying for some time I am sure.
"I'm going to see the movie soon. I have one question, you say that the baby or babies are pushed around in a buggy? I thought the English term was ""pram"" ? I just have family from there and wonder if they changed the wording?  Only curious and a little nosy."
So many twists and turns.  So many screwed up personalities. I felt it was depressing from the get go.  The more I read the more the personalities become more screwy.  Not a feel good read.  More like pathetic lives getting more pathetic.
"This was a very interesting book. The girl is definitely troubled, but it makes her real. I didn't realize it took place in London, which is pretty cool too. It took me a while to get into her character because she does make so many bad decisions - it was hard for me to relate to her. You also need to pay attention to the chapters and the date for each chapter - the chronology is very important in the story line."
"I did not care for this book. It was kept going back and forth between 3 different persons. The main character was an alcoholic, by the time I was halfway thru the book I felt like I had the hangover. Never could understand why it was on the Times Best Seller list. Guess it was just not my kind of book. All the girl did was ride trains and try to remember what happened when she was drunk."
The first 100 or so pages can be a bit long as the author takes a long time to develop multiple character plot lines. However once they do finally tie together the final 100 pages are hard to put down.
Good book but took to long to get interesting.  Wasn't gonna finish it but wanted to read the book before I watched the movie. Hoping the book would be better then the movie. I think the movie will be better.
"I enjoyed this book, I read it for a book club, I can't wait to discuss it. If you can get past the character flaws that cause the difficulties in the first place, then you will truly enjoy this book. It was a who done it to the very end. Although, I didn't overly get attached to the characters I didn't want to see anyone get murdered, but who knows what is in store for Megan, Rachel, and Anna....I guess you will just have to read it for yourself!"
"This novel kept me in suspense throughout the book.  As an avid reader, I generally rate a novel as good if I'm thinking about it during those times when I'm not reading it. I rate a book as very good when I have to put it down, and find myself not only thinking about it, but thinking about what the characters are going to do next and then I find myself clearing my schedule so I can get back to it.  The Girl on the Train was that book for me.  The plot was intricately woven in ways that kept me wondering and second guessing myself about what the protagonist was going to do next.  It was a very good read, and I highly recommend it."
"""The Girl on the Train"" was almost too much for me to read. The author's characterization is astounding. There we times when I wanted to shake the protagonist and slap her silly for being so annoying, but there were other times when I would see myself in her. This book is unlike most others because it leaves you with a weird intense feeling that is hard to describe."
"I enjoyed the story telling via shifting points of view among the three female characters but the story tended to drag after a while.  All in all, it was an enjoyable read and I think this story would make for an entertaining movie.  The author, however, disappointed me a bit when she chose the overused formula of having the antagonist confess all their wrong doings and motives at the end of the story.There seem to be many reviews comparing ""The Girl on the Train"" to ""Gone Girl."" I don't know why unless the publisher is trying to glean sales on the coattails of Gillian Flynn's success.  For the curious, both stories include a missing wife, a distraught husband, and of course a police investigation.  How all that happens and gets resolved are entirely two different stories that don't resemble one another at all."
"I liked the book, even though the characters were hard to like.  The author developed them well; I just thought they all had mental issues, except for the baby.It took a while to get into the book.  Seems like all she did at the beginning was ride the train and drink alcoholic beverages before the action picked up....kind of a slow start.  The plot was good, even though I guessed who the killer was before the twist came at the end of the book.It was a study in human nature and the way people relate to each other."
"I know that this book has been number one on the best seller list, but I didn't care for it.  I felt like the author was trying to copy Gone Girl.  I have not recommended it to friends."
"This was a pretty good read. It was well-written, and suspenseful--it definitely held my attention. It was pretty heavy, though. It deals with alcoholism, domestic violence, murder. Generally it left me feeling pretty sad. Not my best choice of books to read on the beach."
This book was great. I could not put it down. Took me about 5 days to read it. The plot moves quickly and you are engaged the whole time. From start to finish you will not want to put this book down. Great great read
"Being a thriller the book was captivating but the ending went so wrong. I didn't like the character development which is fine, it still would have been a good book anyway if the end didn't turn into a terrible B list horror film full of cringe worthy lines."
"I read a lot of books and I'd have to say that this is one of the best I've ever read. I know it's a cliche but you won't be able to put this one down. It will keep you guessing to the end. Told from different viewpoints, none of the characters are particularly likeable but this just adds to the story. Also addresses issues such as alcoholism and domestic violence, I have no doubt this will one day be a movie."
"It was a fast, easy read once you realized that the chapters were different characters viewpoint.  The publisher's heading the chapters with the names in such light type caused one to skip over them and created the confusion.  Seems to be a combination of Gone Girl and the true life situations in a couple of murders in the headlines in recent times."
"A great exploration into the flawed human psyche. The writer manages to paint a picture of action and characters without muddying the waters with cluttered vocabulary, or grimy sex scenes. An easy and enjoyable read; in my opinion, suitable for teenagers."
"I loved it. It started slow, but if you keep plowing on, it gets so good. Once I was part way through, I couldn't stop reading it till I was done. It is a mystery, but if you think you know the answer, it makes it all that more interesting! Enjoy!"
"This was very well written. I love mysteries that go back and forth like this. You hear about something, a detail that seems important; then, later, you understand how it came to be. I highly recommend this for the mystery/thriller lover."
"Starts a little slow, but a gripping tale that unravels the mystery of a missing woman. Every character is petty and broken, which makes for an interesting story. Though, it seems a bit lazy. Overall, it was entertaining and worth a read."
What a read.  It took me a while to get into the characters and the time frames but then I was hooked.  Pleased I read the book first now will watch the movie.  It's the sort of book you want to share with others so you can talk about it.
"I had been wanting to read this book for a while and I'm so glad i finally took the time to do it. Finished it in a day and a half! The book is intriguing and has you hooked from the very first chapter. Excellent read, highly recommended."
"I am amazed that this book was a best seller.  I found it slow going with no character with whom I identified.  I found the women vacuous and weak while the men were also weak but scary.  It wasn't even surprising or suspenseful, except when one of the men was beating on one of the women.  Goes to show that just because a book is a best seller doesn't mean it is worth reading!!!"
"I know this is a highly-rated NYT Bestseller - but I personally found it hard to follow for at least the first half of the book.  It jumps back/forth between the ""Girl on the Train"" and the individuals she sees from the train and later interacts with.  She is a troubled person and, for much of the book, this interaction seems like a series of delusions (is she just imagining all this or is she schizophrenic and these other people are just her other personalities??)-- until the plot starts to fill in.  No spoilers here.  Overall, it was OK - but lacked the intensity and story-line clarity that I seek in a novel like this."
"Entertaining...but basically just waiting for someone to get their memory back. I didn't feel like I was trying to solve a mystery, it just felt like I had to wait for the author to tell me what happened."
"Wow, an interesting well written book,  it kept me guessing until nearly the very end as to what had all happened and why.  Characters were all people who had trouble of their own now or in the past and it was hard to know who was good and who was bad.  Enjoyed this book a lot..."
"The writing is great, the mystery is mysterious and I can see this becoming another blockbuster a la Gone Girl. It's just that the characters are so dysfunctional and maladjusted that it gets awfully depressing at time. That makes you want to put it away and turn to something lighter. And yet, you keep returning and turning the pages because some miserable demon inside you wants to know if these idiots find redemption in the end. Not really."
I thought this was a very good book.  Held your suspense until the very end. I did not think it would end like it did. I read the book and also saw the movie. Recommend to anyone who likes a surprise ending.
"One of the best novels I've read in a long time. Mind you, not the best, yet worthy of five stars. For me, to give a novel five stars I have to love the main character(s), and I never want it to end. Although it was hard to like any character in this book (in fact, all are unlikable--at least until the end) I didn't want to finish this novel. It is definitely a ""who-dun-it,"" trying to figure out which of the unlikeable characters did it, and it is fun trying to figure out who did. When you do, the novel does lose a little of its punch, but not much. Therefore, to me, this novel earns the full five stars."
All three of the female characters seemed the same so I had to keep checking who was speaking quite a few times.  The last few chapters finally picked up and were exciting but seemed to be written by someone other than the author.
This is a really well written book and deserves five stars for the writing. But I rated it down because all but one of the characters are just so unlikeable and the book is really depressing. It does keep you guessing though. Really good murder mystery!
"At first I hated this book.  It jumped back and forth betwen times and characters, really hard to keep track.  If you don't like this sort of book then this book is not for you.  It took me half way through to start liking it.  It was a real whodunit mystery.  The character of the Girl (on the train) was not especially likable.  Of course I have a problem with alcohholics.  She was weak and annoying.  Not only was she weak but she wanted to go to bed with every man she saw.  They way I am talking you must think why did this reviewer give it a 4.  Well I wanted to give it a 3 plus but you can't do that.  The ending was good though or should I say the last 1/2 of the book."
I loved this book. It was full of suspense and had more twist than I am use to in a thriller. Even the last few chapters after everything is said and done have twist in them. Loved this book and would recommend it.
"Expected so much more. Good reading buddies said they couldn't put it down so I had to read it. What a total waste of time.  The characters are absurd, the twists are predictable, the writing is average.  Not sure what everyone else saw in this book."
"Unlike a traditional mystery in which a murder is the whole reason for the story, The Girl on the Train is even more so about the fascinating characters who tell the story. Maybe not the best book for right before you need to go to bed because you may find yourself unable to put it down; however, I opted to just miss sleep. Many twists and turns...and I'll stop before I give away any spoilers!"
Loved it! One of the few books I've read really quickly (1 day - only because I had to sleep!) It was that good. Interesting characters and gripping suspense which makes a perfect formula for a blockbuster.The ending got a little predictable about halfway in but the ride throughout was like a rollercoaster.Highly recommended.
I absolutely loved this book. I would honestly recommend it to anyone who likes a mystery. Someone who can literally just throw themselves into a book because this book is honestly one of my favorites now! It written really well and it was a definite shock.
"Read it in 24 hours, couldn't put it down!  Can't wait for the movie to be released and see Emily Blunt as Rachel!"
I think this book is over-rated. I like to root for someone and I just didn't feel that for any of the characters.
"The concept was clever, and as the narrators told their story we were drawn into solving the mystery of what the girl on the train saw along with her. It was a convoluted story, that jumped around in time perhaps inevitable with the main narrator, Rachel, being so troubled and often hungover! The resolution was satisfying but I thought there was a retelling of the back story at the end to make the pieces fit."
"I tried three different times to get into this book and I found it tedious with a boring plot.  In addition, it takes place in England and I really steer clear of book happening in some place besides the United States.  I would not recommend this book."
"I liked that it was a fast read, couldn't put it down type of book. It is a good mystery that was written in a clever way going back & forth amongst the characters. I struggled a little with the fact that I had a hard time feeling empathy for any of the main characters. It's not going to win the National Book Award or the Booker Mann but all in all it was a book that held my attention & kept me interested."
"I loved that the book was written with alternating persons/points of views. I found the characters to be very relatable, which got my attention and kept it. The twisting plot and unveiled secrets kept my attention and I finished the book very quickly. Great read."
"Rachell believes that she is the reason that her marriage failed.  Unable to get pregnant she becomes depressed and turns to alcohol. Now divorced, she rides the train to work and passes her former home seeing it now occupied by her ex, his new wife and daughter.  But that is not all she sees.  The perfect couple lives four houses away. Every day Rachell rides the train and hopes to get a glimpse of Scott and Megan, living vicariously in their perfect relationship, until...Rachell involves herself in a missing person case.  Many twists and turns in this who done it.  A fun read.  Loved the train ride."
"Over 20,000 people can't be wrong. Check out the sample, you'd end up buying the book. I needed a change in the category of novels I had been selecting and this was it. Suspenseful, a smidge dark, with pieces of surprises here and there. The plot and the characters are like something I have not experienced before. If you identify with the main character(s), the book is that much better. No story is perfect, with the exception of a few exceptional pieces, but I'm rating this a 5-star because this one make me want to pick up another suspenseful novel."
"This book required a little time on my part to easily go back and forth between the first person accounts of the story from the 2 main characters. I sometimes had to go back and remind myself of who was speaking at a particular point. I also found the psychological problems of one of the main characters not pursued enough to explain the reasons why she did what she did. Aside from those 2 things, I liked the book very much.  I loved the use of the ""train"" in telling the story. The ending was somewhat of a surprise to me which is good---I don't like to figure it out ahead of time. I would recommend the book for those who like to think versus be entertained."
"The heroine is sappy and predictable, and afforded little depth besides her trite ""daddy"" issues, unconditional romanticism of her dysfunctional marriage, and eye-roll inducing alcoholism. Still, she is not unlikeable as a companion for a day at the beach. The plot easily picks up from any distractions you may encounter. It reads like a summer flick, and the biggest element of this plodding mystery is what actors will play the leading roles. Cotton candy, summer reading."
"I downloaded this book this morning after hearing about the plot last night. I JUST finished, and I was ready to give it a four star rating because the men in the book get a really bad rap. Then I thought about Detective Gaskill, Andy, and others and changed my rating to a five. As a reader of this review, you need to know that this is a well-written, suspenseful, psychological thriller that will leave you loving every one of the characters as much as you want to hate their behavior. ENJOY!"
"I feel this book was hyped up by the media more than it deserved. It was a good summer read, but not anything that I would tell people that they had to read.  The characters were developed well, but the main character (Rachel) was actually becoming annoying to me. I felt that she wanted to play the victim and after a while I wanted to say just pull your big girl panties on and deal with it. I'm not disappointed that I read it I just would not say it was worth all the stars that it has been receiving."
"This was the most difficult book to read that I have read lately.  The story was just plain strange and lead you to believe the main character was a whack case with an immense drinking problem (which she has).  For all the reviews, top of the charts I was sorely disappointed in this book."
"I wanted so much to like the characters,  but found myself scoffing through much of this book.  They are all self absorbed, pathetic and just plain boring. I could not like, nor feel sorry for any of them.  Rachel drove me crazy with the mess she continued to make of her life.  Anna was a sorry excuse for a wife and mother.  Each and every character was dis-likable in their own way and I got tired of the phony dramas in their lives.  I could not wait to get this book over with and the only reason I stuck with it was to prove that I figured out ""who did it"" by mid book.  I was right by the way.  Why on earth the high ratings - I will never know."
"Paula Hawkins does an exemplary job at spinning a tail displaying human behavior. She has crafted a story that is suspenseful, full of detail...you get a clear look into each character...BUT...the pieces fall into place timely. The reader is like the detectives...puzzled. It's the intrigue that propels the reader to get to the end if the book.I found myself picking up the pace in reading just as the story climaxed...literally on the edge if my seat. Paula Hawkins is an excellent writer. It is beneficial as you read to pay attention to the dates. Happy reading, you won't regret it!"
I heard great reviews on cbs what a great book to read. I bought it and was very excited. I kept thinking thinking it would get better but instead worse. I hated that I spent 10.00 for it. I would not recommend it to anyone.
I would not recommend the book. So much repetition with the characters. The end came very sudden. And it was depressing. It was a thriller at the end. I usually don't read thrillers. Will not see the movie now.
"The ""girl"" proved to be someone I didn't like and couldn't get interested in.  I wasted my money on this book and could never finish it.  I will find someone to give it to as soon as I remember to do so."
"I bought this book thinking that it was going to be as dark and mysterious as Gone Girl like all the other reviews said. It is a page turner and you don't know what twists are going to be thrown in, but it doesn't have the sinister depth and complexity I was looking for. It reads like a very random journal by the three women and you try to piece the story together but the women are all so similar and you get confused, especially the main anatongonist she doesn't even know whats going on. All troubled and looking to the man for help and sympathy. It was okay, but not Gone Girl hype."
"This story is just crazy.  Rachel is such a mess and if you've ever thought someone's life is perfect, most likely it's not!  Once I started reading I couldn't put it down.  Then the conclusion, that sure surprised me.  A good read.  You definitely can get caught up in their lives!"
"This was the first time I ever read Hawkins, but I was certainly intrigued. At the time that I read this book, I was on a big psychological/mystery binge combined with a bit of  contemporary chick-lit. This book balances all the genres beautifully! I love being unable to predict the end of a book, as it keeps me humble and engaged.I recommend this book to anyone who is trying to branch out of being ""stuck"" in one type of genre. This book will make transition easy!"
"A brilliantly told story of love, betrayals, obsession. Rachel lost and lonely tries to surmount her deep depression after loosing her husband to another woman. She looses her grip on life becomes a drunk but believes firmly that Tom will come back to her. Against this repetitive background of ""self abuse"" a much darker story emerges slowly on a quiet out of the way residential street under the gaze of the continually passing trains..."
"I saw a brief review of this book somewhere and read a free chapter - and was hooked.  The train rides and house-peeping were filled with mystery and imagination.  Rachel fantasizes about the people she sees and then - as she bottoms out - drinking alcohol, losing her husband, losing her job, she is thrust into the reality of those she has been watching.  The descriptions of her late night walks, her black-outs, her pleas for help - meander down dark paths and emerge in an unanticipated place.  The beginning of the book made me think of Hitchcock - but then it took some unexpected turns.  I'm not entirely sure how I feel about the ending - having just finished it at 3:00 in the morning - not being able to put it down when I should have been sleeping.  The morning alarm sounds in 2 hours. Perhaps I'll have come to terms with it by then.  Worth the read!"
"Starts slow, builds evenly and is pretty compulsive reading in the middle.  The twist is a little thin and the clues and reveal are muddied together in this memory-meets-diary format, so it almost felt like the climax was somehow off the beat, or ill-timed, even though I guess it wasn't.  But it fell a bit flat for me at the last.  That aside, it was the best read I've had in a long time and I'll definitely look for more from this author."
WHY is there so much praise for this TERRIBLE book?!!!  I cannot BELIEVE that anyone thinks this book is so fantastic!!  It's DEPRESSING and poorly written.  Don't waste your money!!
"It is a very intriguing way or writing a book.  Rachel, the lead character has a very sad life driven by alcohol and despair.  I must say that I got thrown off by the character switches and the going back and fort in time.  But it was very hard to put down, I had to go on reading because I wanted to know what happened, why it happened.  The two couples that lived on that street, in those aligned houses that Rachel saw everyday seemed picture perfect.  Nothing bad could ever happen, they had it good.  Things aren't always as they appear...A very good read."
"This book is written from the point of view of 3 different women and goes back and forth on timing, if that annoys you then you might not enjoy this. I typically don't like that but I loved this book. Can't wait for the movie"
This book felt like it was written quickly with the rhythm of the train grinding to and fro between London and Witley always rumbling past in the back ground. The persistent English rain relentlessly drenches the suburban street where the action unfolds between two sets of couples all of whose lives and in some cases deaths are intertwined with Rachel - an ex-lover - the unfortunate jilted lover watching it all happen from the passing train.Quite similar to Gone Girl in style of writing - maybe they'll make a movie of this one too.
"The reader must keep track of the dates written at the beginning of each chapter. Otherwise, it gets confusing! I could not put it down, once I got ""the hang of it"", so to speak.  Very clever plots and twists."
"I really enjoyed this book from beginning to end. I didn't find moments where I was bored or distracted and felt the story and characters continued to build throughout - the individuals were believable, as was the story, and I would recommend the book to anyone who enjoyed Gone Girl and other novels in that vein."
"Keeps you intrigued as the story evolves. An intent to voice middle class women's relationships and interior life, not really accomplished falling in common place predictable lógic.Not great narrative or outstanding prose. A good read for a boring long trip."
"This is a constantly evolving story which is why it keeps you reading. In fact, it was very hard to put this book down. It starts off seeming like the story of a woman who happily lives vicariously through others. Then it evolves into a story about relationships and how hard it is to let it go when it ends and then evolves yet again into a murder mystery.  And that's just from the point of view of the main protagonist. It's written from the point of view of 3 different women which gives it wonderful texture.  It also provides wonderful twists and turns.  I didn't see the ending coming. It's an excellent read that I'd recommend to anyone."
"Excellent book!  It grabbed my attention from the beginning, and I could not stop reading until I was done.  The weaving of the characters, as they collided into each other, was startling and engulfing.  The style of writing in this book seemed to tantalize my desire to know the truth, and thus added to the atmosphere of its mystery."
"I love a good thriller and this did not disappoint. You think you've figured it out or know what's coming next, but you soon discover you're wrong. The different points of view from which this story is told adds to the intense drama of the story, and there is a spirited pace to the story that makes the action come alive as the last few chapters whizz by. The dates and timelines of the story are all relevant as you see the story unfold and have many moments of ""aaahhhh"". Good stuff!"
"This book was a thrill to read so much so that I finished it within 48 hours of starting it. It's fast-paced, smart and very surprising in the end. I highly recommend it. Definitely looking forward to seeing the movie in October!"
"I couldn't put it down! It's the kind of story so close to reality that you become engrossed with it's characters lives. It was difficult to determine what was to come next, it keeps you interested and leaves you in awe, wanting more..."
"This book is often compared to Gone Girl, but I liked it much better than the latter because it wasn't as bizzare but still it wound around and surprised me sometimes - actually, farilhy often.  I thought the characters were well developed and the action in keeping with the convoluted plot.I could relate to many of the characters and understand their ""take"" on events."
"This was supposed to be this year's Gone Girl, but it didn't come close. Has some similarities, 3 different narrators, but it doesn't come close. A decent mystery, but not the shocking twist at the end that had been promised. Too much of the plot depended on the primary narrator's loss of memory on a single night, which came across as a little contrived. And I saw the twist at the end coming half way through."
"Not a bad book. It definitely isn't on my list of favorites. I hate when I figure out the ending half way thru. Writing is decent but the story wasn't as clever as it could of been and there were absolutely no redeeming qualities of any of the characters. Nevertheless, quick read, and I guess, it's good to say you read it."
"I loved this book. It was a little slow going at times, but worth the effort. If you liked Gone Girl, you will probably like this. And it has a happier ending. No real spoiler there. Any book would have a happier ending than Gone Girl."
"Every mystery has u guessing the possible ending that is waiting for the reader, waiting for the characters. The girl on this train has you guessing what happened in the beginning, what really occurred in the middle, what does each chapter insinuate...guessing till the end"
"Good thriller, could not put it down. I was worried I would be confused with the changing of the characters, but it is important to know what is happening to the characters.  It's easy reading with a surprise d ending.  I give it four stars."
"I didn't hate the book. It was written like Gone Girl going between characters and dates. The writing was fine, I was interested in what was going to happen next. By the end, the main character was getting on my nerves. I feel there were many ""clues"" to lead you to who it was. Had there been a twist I would've liked the book.  I don't usually try to figure the ending, but this one slapped me in the face."
"After all the advertising and buzz re: the book and movie, I found the plot to be slightly predictable. I won't say more so I don't inadvertently make a statement that becomes a spoiler. Ok read, but not as good a I thought it would be."
"This book was a welcome surprise,it kept me on edge and I couldn't put it down.  I would highly recommend  this book. It is a long time since I have shut the doors and closed off from everything to dedicate myself to two days of self centered reading time."
"while this book had a good story line, I found it a bit long. I read it in two sections and would not have gone back to the second half but for the urging of friends who had read and enjoyed it.  I am pleased their recommendations were successful because it turned out to be well worth it.  The story is told by several characters in separate chapters, all leading to the conclusion."
"Excellent story, and a book I couldn't put down. BUT since I read it on my Kindle, I found it hard to get the time sequences. My only complaint is that by going back and forth in time, and in narrators, I found it hard to follow - at least in the beginning chapters. After I caught on, I realized I had to look carefully at the first page to see who it was and when it was. A really good story and written well."
"For a book to be on a best seller list for so many weeks,  I had hopes of more entertainment. Instead it was confusing, and dull to say nothing of boring. I predicted the killer from the get-go and was not disappointed. Not a great read at all. Try another 'train' book."
"I was a little unsure when I first started reading the book - a totally different style than I'm used to reading but was recommended the book after reading Gone Girl.  As i got through the first couple chapters, I was hooked and couldn't put it down!"
A novel where the author did an outstanding job making every single one of the characters not only flawed but universally unlikable. I enjoyed the authors style and they do a good job at setting up a whodunit they might keep you guessing until the end.
"I love easy and lighthearted reads, but this was neither.  I had to keep referring back to make sure I following along as it was told in the voice of 3 different characters over a period of time.  So knowing who was ""talking"" and when was important.  But I found that made me pay more attention to the content.  It was hard to put the book down.  I loved the book!"
"I decided to give this book a shot since it's coming out as a film soon. I went in to it knowing nothing about it-which I think was a good way to go. I didn't read a summary, any reviews, just hoped my friend made a good recommendation. I would definitely recommend it. Give it a shot."
"I did not enjoy reading this book because the main character was a drunk and was prying into other's business. She seemed to have many mental issues as well. The ending was a surprise and may justify the means of telling the story the way it was told, from the point of view of 3 different women whose lives are entangled. I would not recommend this to others unless they enjoy dark drama."
Wow I couldn't put this book down. I needed to know what happens with an intensity I hadn't felt in a while.  I love this genre.  This cast of character is really hard to like in any scenario almost like a reality show (I.e kardashians) you hate that you love to want to know what happens to the miserable lot. But this is better cause Paula Hawkins is really a talented writer.  Can't wait for her next one!
"I was somewhat disappointed in the book what with all the rave reviews. It seems like to took too long to get to the climax and then it was over too quickly. I feel the author could have done more with the development of the main character. There was too much redundancy in her behavior, as one would expect in someone with chemical dependency issues but her behavior became boring after a while."
"This is hands down, one of my favorite books ever. The plot twists are crazy and every single character gets their own personality. I am not going to spoil anything about the plot, but I would definitely recommend this book to anyone."
"I don't particularly like leaving unpleasant reviews. However this book just wasn't to my taste. Its written very well, and has enough suspense to keep you easily entertained. However I only finished it because I paid for it. It was emotionally dark if I may say so. However, given you don't mind that, you'd find a very delightful read."
"i found the book difficult to read.  I  was about 35% through the novel before I began to understand that it was 3 different women telling their story.  I do think that this is when reading the actual book, not the Kindle version, is easier.  It continued to go back and forth in time.  The 2nd part of the novel was much better than the beginning.  It will be interesting to discuss this in our book club."
This book kept me guessing the entire time. I definitely needed s one wine at the end. Great book and can't wait to read more of her books.
"This novel began as a page-turner. I kept reading in the hopes that something would actually happen to surprise me. I figured out the ending well into the first few chapters. However, it was a quick and entertaining read. Won't see the film adaptation."
"Great novel, I couldn't put it down, can't wait to see the movie with Emily Blunt, one of my favorite actresses"
IT took a while to get into but it was worth it in the end.I Look forward to the movie
"I enjoyed the storyline, the characters felt real and messy. The switch between the povs was well done and not over-done. Reviews are all subjective but this book was well written and made me feel something and that's what I look for in a reading experience. So, overall, I highly recommend."
story alternates between the 3 female characters revealing brilliantly thru each ones eyes at the end. I honestly had to read the first 20 pages three times as it started off slow but once I got past last the book was a page turner. Can't wait to se the movie.
"I must commend the author for writing a character one really doesn't like. The protagonist consistently makes bad decisions and gets drunk, but the reader keeps reading. I don't understand the hype and praise for this book. Though well written with some mystery and suspense, the story wasn't very appealing to me."
"I dont get the hooplah...this is written in a very simplistic style, and its just not that compelling.  Furthermore, the plot is just untenable.  The comparisons to gone girl are undeserved.  While that was no masterwork either, it was much, much better than this book.  I was very disappointed."
"Although I hesitate to make comparisons, The Girl on the Train is not quite as compelling as Gone Girl but still a very good read.  It had me guessing until the end.  To see it through the eyes of 3 different narrators, though not a ""novel"" idea, kept me included.  Though the main character, Rachel, is a lonely, dysfunctional alcoholic, I cared about her.  That in itself helps make me want to root for her."
"This book kept showing up on suggested books for me because I loved All The Light We Cannot See. The problem is, this is a fun, vacation read thriller and not of the same caliber of the other book. It's more like a book written in hopes of becoming a movie- entertaining but not great literature."
"This story is narrated from the viewpoint of three women. The author jumps between them and time frames sliding from the current time to past. I found it rather cumbersome but, at the insistence of my daughter, I kept reading. It did get better around the middle of the book. Unfortunately, by then I had a really good idea who caused all the havoc."
"Paula Hawkins scores a huge literary and commercial success. Loved this very cleverly written whodunit..... did not want it to end. Kept me guessing almost to the end. Hoping a movie will be made, but not sure how they could possibly capture the mood and use the various narrators to tell the story as the book does. Highly recommended."
Honestly had to force myself to get through they first few chapters because they were so depressing but the story gets really good and you have to keep reading because you can't wait to see what happens next!
"Why are negative reviews so NASTY? It's really okay to not like a book but why take the time to rip it apart? Why all the anger? We are all looking for a more civilized world and people (women...more women will read this book) PEOPLE - IT'S JUST A BOOK. This women sat down, put the effort in, wrote a story, and sold it. Even if you didn't care for it THINK about the entire process and give your honest opinion without the snide comments.My opinion: The book was fun to read. The ending wasn't spectacular but it fit. Book clubs would have a great discussion with this one.Easy read, page turner, and clever plot. Take a chance and read it."
"The book was different, and that made it good.  Strange basis for a plot, it kept my interest.  The ending was a bit anti-climatic.  With all the drama taking place during the story, I expected it to end with a bigger bang."
"Read it in 48 hours... The first book in months where I could not put it down. I love how it encases the lives of three women and how their stories intertwine. It's a must-read, page turner - a book I would definitely recommend. It's been awhile since I've read a wonderful book like this, and it reminded me of my love for reading, once again."
Amazing twists and turns and just a read I could not put down. I read it in four nights which is unusual for me. I would highly recommend it for great narration and thrilling plot- can't wait to see the movie.
"Should have been entitled ""I know it's stupid and I shouldn't do it, but I just can't help myself!""  Never read a book with so many crazy, neurotic women in it.  No empathy nor sympathy with any of them.  Poor thing, she can't have a baby (which the world really needs) so it just maked her not so right in the head.However, to be charitable, not really bad writing, did keep one's interest wanting to know what happens next and who the killer is."
"I’d initially been on the fence about buying and reading The Girl on the Train, not because I was put off by the content but because it reminded me of so many other bestsellers I’d already read. But I gotta tell you that I’m a sucker for taking a walk on the dark side, so I eventually caved and made the purchase.Despite the formula, the storytelling and style is unique so I’d still suggest you give this a go if you’re into a psychological thriller that digs very, very deep. It’s not a book for the faint-hearted or those looking for happily ever afters, but it’s a solid one if you enjoy reading about humanity’s more sinister side."
This isn't great literature but it's a very good read.  I read it on vacation in a matter of days which really helped the time pass during the travel time.  There are constant plot twists and the pace of the book is fast which I appreciate.  The lead character was a little hard to like at first but her kookiness & irrational thinking grew on me.
"Not that big a deal. Story felt like it could have been 10,000 or 20,000 words shorter. Too much of it felt like s t r e t c h i n g.Characters just fumbling around in a deliberately unclear story felt annoying to me.Depressed drunk stumbling around in unclear memories just got irritating.Best part of the story was trying figure out the various possible story lines, possible ways it would play out.The ending is one of the endings that will occur to you.-To be honest it's a mystery to me why this book is so popular."
"Great read, finished it quickly and looked forward to my scheduled reading sessions eagerly! Had a twist, which I appreciate because typically, I can figure out ending early on. Boy was I wrong ! I liked it !"
"At first I thought The Girl on the Train was slow, but then once I got into it the story got more complex.  The story lines changed slowly.  Each character had different layers in their personalities and in their perspectives of reality."
"Rather bizarre, but once you understand that chapters are written from the perspectives of the main characters, you'll enjoy the story more.  Looks like the movie, coming out in October, will be even better than the book."
"It dragged a little in the middle and I felt like the author spent too much time with the lead character wringing her hands about how she can't remember.  She was a complex and flawed character, which I liked."
"""The Girl on the Train' by Paula Hawkins is an interesting book to say the least.  The chapters are not numbered, but each chapter is titled with the name of one of the three main women characters (Rachel, Megan, and Anna) and is told from the words of that character.  The male characters are, of course, important as well, as one of them turns out to  be a murderer, of one of the main female characters.  You'll have to read the book to find out who the victim and murderer are.  Suffice it to say, that your suspicions will switch back and forth as you read the book.  Despite of some strong language the book is worth reading."
"Loved this book, I am a big fan of Gillian Flynn and Tanya French and this read met all of my expectations.  The depth of the main character developed by this author underlines the flaws and frustrations of the human experience, with the backdrop of a truly mesmerizing and creepy murder mystery."
"Takes a while to get into the plot, but after I read awhile, the suspense captured me. Writing in first person reminded me of Gone Girl. Recommended reading for those who enjoy detailed, emotional descriptions."
"This book got me hooked quick, it's written in that 'can't wait to find out what happens next"" fashion so it started as a real page turner. I liked the premise. That being said, about 1/3 of the way into the book all hell broke loose as far as character development/motiviation/etc. The main character began doing incredibly stupid and non-sensical things. It was all very contrived. I figured out who the killer was half-way through (I kept hoping I was wrong because it seemed too easy but I was right) so the ending was disappointing. It was a quick read so if you go for it you won't waste too much of your life."
The writing was just okay.  Very slow at times and I kept finding myself thinking there was too much unnecessary detail and I was wishing the author would just get on with it and get to something interesting.
"The girl on the train is an alcoholic who is fired from her job and hides that fact from her caring roommate for fear of being homeless.  She observes a couple along her daily train trip, who live in her old neighborhood and makes up a story, in her mind, about them.  She becomes involved in a twisted story about the murder of the wife but what is true?  He ex-husband lives down the street with his new wife, ""the other woman"".  How are they involved?  There are no reliable characters in this story and that is what makes it so intriguing.  It is a good read with surprising ending."
Well written and deeply engrossing. Perhaps the best passages are those in which the despair and embarrassment of  Rachel's addiction are so acutely felt. Hard to imagine the author hasn't been there herself.
Wanted to read before seeing the movie. It would have been better had I read all in one sitting but was unable to do so. It seemed a little slow and confusing going back-and-forth in time. Liked GONE GIRL better.
"Really engaging, and intriguing all the way to the end. Created a real sense of images that came and went and were hard to integrate. You got the same feeling that Rachel had -- that there was something she could not put her finger on. Very interesting structure. Would make a great movie."
"On a whim, I decided to purchase this as an ebook. I wanted to read something mysterious and captivating. The reviews seemed so good that I couldn't pass it up.About halfway through I was saying to myself ""Oh I definitely know what's going on now. This is SO predictable.""But no. The further you get into the book, the more you're drawn in and the more you get to see each character's story and point of view.One of the better mysteries that I've read."
"This book dragged for me and did so for a really time.  Rachel was stuck for such a long period of time that I began to lose patience with - and then interest in - her character.  However, since I was reading this for our Book Club, I continued to slog through and I'm SO glad I did!  What a wild ride to the end.  The author grabs you by the nape of the neck and won't let go until the last page. Don't miss this one!"
"This rather short novel starts off in an intriguing way, a woman living vicariously through the imagined lives of strangers she sees on the way to work. Unfortunately, it devolves into a rote thriller with a rather tedious conclusion with the villain explaining everything to the hero. The main character Rachel is quite interesting, and her struggles with depression and alcoholism deserve a better story."
"I was in a reading rut and needed something to re-ignite the flame. I had heard a lot of positive comments on the book and had people give me personal recommendations for it. In my opinion, the boom started a little slow. But once the action started I couldn't put the book down!"
"I bought this book because of all the great reviews and the comparison to ""Gone Girl"" (which is the only Gillian Flynn book I liked) but this book surpasses it. The plot is intricately woven with the narration of three women and their intersecting lives. The story is suspenseful, smart and I couldn't put the book down until I was finished. There are twists and turns and though I did figure out who the killer was and why, it was still exciting and even more twisty than I imagined.Truly, I don't understand all the negative reviews but so many seem to be based on the characters' personalities and weaknesses. I'm sorry but this is a murder mystery filled with flawed people which is truly realistic. What were readers expecting? Heroes and perfect, moral characters? How boring would that be as well as unrealistic. So many main characters in literature are flawed, imperfect, weak, tragic, and broken. It's sad that so many people think a character who was abused or who has a drinking problem isn't work reading about or listening to. Each character in this book has their flaws which come out here and there throughout the book, making you realize that what you thought you knew, you didn't know at all. It's also incredible to me that the same people who complained about the flawed characters were also offended by the comparison to ""Gone Girl."" Because the characters in that book weren't flawed with infidelity, psychopathy and more? The characters in this book are far more redeemable.I loved this book. I would recommend it to anyone and I can't wait to read the next book by this author!"
"A very good read, and the twists are fantastic. The characters are so different and complex but so flawed and yet strong in an amazing way. The women were strong, determined, yes flawed, human and this an extraordinary book. I cannot wait to see the movie!"
"This book is slow to start and from the beginning you question why it was on the best seller list for so long.  The main characters are depressing and seem to never truly develop for the reader.  Although the last third of the book starts to pick up, it was not worth the wait.  Unless you have nothing else available, I would look for another book to read."
"The book's popularity gave me hope that I, too, would love it.  But I was a bit disappointed in it.  It did, at least, hold my interest long enough to finish it.  I had a real problem with liking the main character, which always makes it more difficult to fully enjoy a book like this.  And I did guess who the bad guy/gal was about halfway through, so no surprises there."
I read a lot of mysteries but apparently not so much this style. I found it creepy as I read but I couldn't quit reading till the end. It was very well structured and written. I kept wondering how it could be made into a movie because it would be great! Sort of a British Gone Girl with peeks into private lives and twists and turns. I still think about it!
"If you hated Gone Girl, you'll hate this. If you enjoyed Gone Girl, as I did, you still might not like this. Other reviewers have done a great job reviewing the weakness of the characterization in this novel. One loses patience for the lot of them. Interestingly, though, I felt compelled to read to the end to find out if my (eventual) guess was correct. If I had to do it again, I'd skip this one."
"This was the most difficult book to read that I have read lately.  The story was just plain strange and lead you to believe the main character was a whack case with an immense drinking problem (which she has).  For all the reviews, top of the charts I was sorely disappointed in this book."
This was an excellent book. It keeps you guessing and engaged. It was a great story line and love the way the author takes you from past to presences to fill in the gaps and set the plot. I really enjoy it.
"Just finished this and found the book to be excellent. The usage of ""first person"" story telling with several shifting characters provided great understanding of each. The conclusion of the story was a surprise yet not a surprise. Highly recommend!"
"It took me a while to get into this book and to care about the alcoholic, depressed girl on the train.  Then I got pulled in and enjoyed it to theunexpected and satisfying end.  If you find it going slow for the first few chapters stick with it is worth it.  Actually, I found myself thinkingabout the story for several days after finishing the book."
"So readable! Easy to keep characters straight and pick up the story after a few days absence -- both important for the older, fading memory crowd! Keeps you guessing, surprises you, touches your heart strings even for the most unlikable traits of characters. The rare book that I couldn't put down and didn't want to end. No wonder it's staying at number one for so long!"
"Without going over the storyline I just want to say I loved this book, started it and finished it in one night I couldn't put it down. Author did a great job at making you wonder who did it, just a well written book!! Highly recommend :)"
"Good story, but something was missing.  It moved quickly and held my attention.... but....I wasn't passionately connected to any of the characters. I think because the voice of the three women sounded the same, I didn't really connect more with one than the other.  I had to often look at the chapter title at first to see who was speaking. But... overall good plot."
"Excellent book!  It grabbed my attention from the beginning, and I could not stop reading until I was done.  The weaving of the characters, as they collided into each other, was startling and engulfing.  The style of writing in this book seemed to tantalize my desire to know the truth, and thus added to the atmosphere of its mystery."
"This was a fast read for me, it kept my interest throughout but I did not like any of the personalities of any characters. They all drove me crazy in some way. I kept reading it just to find out who did it.  This won't stop me from any of Paula Hawkins other books, just did not like this particular book."
"I was so excited to read this book.  I really enjoyed the book overall, but the ending became predictable too soon.  I really wanted the shock factor that so many speak of, but it ended in disappointment for me.  A great read overall."
"This book started slow but developed quickly. I myself have had issues with drinking, uncertainty  and confusion ....and this really worked as a representation of that.The mystery is fantastic gripping you until the end"
This is not my genre of book at all but it was SO GOOD!!  I could barely put it down once I started reading it.  There were lots of interesting things about it to discuss with my husband and my friend who also read it and loved it.
This book had me thinking about it and excited when it was time to pick it back up. The characters felt very real and the way the chapters were broken down made it easy to bond with each individually.  I highly recommend this book.
I don't know what the hype is about this book. It was actually kind of boring until maybe the last 10%. I wasn't rushing back to it to read more each night. Kind of slogged through it. I'm curious to see how they will execute this plot in movie format.
"Started off way to slow. I had decided not to finish and then a friend said how much she loves the book and movie, so I picked it back up. Once it got going, it was really good. Love surprise endings."
"meh.... I liked it. I liked the writing style - felt it was solid. I didn't like the characters and suspected the killer. I felt the ending was too unavailing. But really, given Rachel's personality, I cannot see the story ending any other way. The story is plot-driven. There is not one likeable character in the book but sometimes that is okay. Sometimes, that's just life. Although, The Girl On the Train was a thrilling read, it had too much hype surrounding it and therefore, the book did not live up to my expectations."
"I read this book first, and then my husband read it.  He seemed to have some trouble keeping track, as each chapter followed a different person's story, but I thought it was good.  It held my attention, and although I guessed the ending, I guess you could say that it ended with a twist."
I did want to find out who committed the crime and isn't that  the test of any good mystery? Still I would have liked this book more if any one of the characters was likeable or more redeemable. Every character was significantly flawed which made you somewhat less invested in wanting to see the guilty person face the music. You almost felt that lying and cheating in a marriage was so common place as to not be reprehensible. The three women who narrate the story are all victims of their poor decisions. I would have liked to see one of them find a light at the end of the tunnel.
"I regret buying this book, the plot seemed to be interesting and the positive reviews made me think it was worth reading, well, that was not the case. The  way the story is written is really boring, very repetitive, I didn't care for any of the characters. The main character was a drunk looser I struggled to like her but the writer made it impossible, she just kept making the same mistakes over and over again. I kept reading hoping that at some point the story would have a twist, that it would get more interesting... that never happened, at some point you just guess the ending."
"My problem with The Girl on the Train was not the ""unreliable"" set of narrators, it was that they were interchangeable.  They were all neurotic, hiding things from their pasts and their ""voice"" was the same. The men could have been interchangeable as well. The men, likewise, were similar, sometimes tender, sometimes not, messy, sneaky and they liked beer.  This may have been a plot device to enhance the suspense, but it wore thin.  I was longing for someone to root for, but the sorry set of characters turned me off.  (I confess I had the same reaction to Gone Girl.) Good literature has memorable characters.  This book didn't."
"Pulled me right in. Despite issues of the protagonist, I was rooting for her right away and all along. I liked that I wasn't able to figure out the ""truth"" until the very end. Even though some of the issues were everyday issues people may deal with, they were handled in an way that didn't make them cliche. I also felt the premise was unique and interesting. I would say if you're looking for high literary writing, this is not it, but it was satisfying to me because of the premise, suspense and lack of cliche."
"I enjoyed reading this book which is why I gave it 3 stars.  Yes, it is something of a page-turner.  I had to finish it just to get to the climax and find out ""who-done-it.""  But, it is not on par with Gone Girl.  It's failings prevent me giving it a 4 or 5.  Nor should it be compared to a master such as Hitchcock.  Ms. Hawkins may aspire to and strive for such greatness, but she didn't achieve it with this - her debut novel.  And one shouldn't expect her to. The plot and structure are clever.  The characters, however, are unbelievable and unrealistic and their actions and choices are convenient for the plot."
"It was good, but the number of characters became a little confusing, since the majority of the book is written in first person, and it will jump from one female character to another female.  You need to get the main characters in your mind first, and then you can get the story line.  It will be as good movie, since it does have a little ""mystic"" feel in the story, and you are not sure who did  the crime and why.."
"The story is interesting in the beginning but it sort of drags on too long. I felt myself getting tired of reading the same stuff over and over again. I also found it a bit confusing as the author goes back and forth with a chapter on one character and then the next chapter on another. Also, the times are confusing. I wasn't sure when she is talking about the present verses the past. The end does have a nice twist to it. I don't think I will read books by this author again knowing how she writes. Too bad because this book was highly recommended and I found it a little disappointing."
I was so disappointed because the reviews were good. Have just come back from a Book Club meeting an everyone had the same opinion. It really made no sense. This is he first time in years I did not complete a book I had downloaded. Would give it no recommendation at all.
"I loved the way the author played with time in the book, jumping between narratives and months/years. The development of the characters, particularly Rachel, gripped me from the get-go. This isn't a book to read bit-by-bit...it's made to be read in BIG gulps. The ending was a bit of letdown, as it seemed a bit too on the soap opera side... but I still really enjoyed this book overall."
"Can hardly wait to see the movie!  Fantastic reading, kept me hooked the whole time from start to the finish"
"I wanted to like this book, I really did. It got great reviews, and I was excited to dig in. What a disappointment. I saw myself in some of the characters, but they became stupidly predictable and unrealistic. The whole plot was unrealistic, to be honest. I also had a hard time just getting into the book. I took frequent breaks while reading it because I just kept getting bored with it. Oh well."
Marilyn T EdwardsAmazon recommended this book.What a thriller! I was doubly pleased that I couldn't second guess the author.I will recommend it to all my friends and familyI don't belong to a book club but they do.
"I wouldn't recommend this book. It sits and steeps repetitively in unhealthy minds with little variation, plot or interest. The end is predictable and the writing and vocabulary are on a 3rd grade level at most. How much did the publishers pay to get this on the bestseller list."
"I'm a reader not a writer so my reviews are normally brief . I don't think this book lived up to all the hype . To me it was just another mystery with a lot of improbable parts in the plot .  I would not recommend this book because there are a lot of other better mystery novels out there . Read ""The Girl from Kraków"" instead."
"This suspenseful book is great ! It keeps you staying up late to read this page turner! If you loved Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl or Dark Places, you will love this read! It is worth the read even with all the hype surrounding it. Enjoy your next read!"
Better than the movie.
"Holy schnikes, y’all.  I’m speechless….I don’t even know where to begin without giving anything away, so for the sake of this review, I’m not going to recap anything and just let you know what I thought.  I’m a little late to this party, so my thoughts may not matter, but let me begin by stating that this book was simply AMAZING!The Girl on the Train is an intriguing and an utterly compelling literary masterpiece that has become one of my favorite reads this year.  What started out as a slow burn blazed into this fire – this raging desire to continue reading this twisted tale that kept me guessing throughout.  This whole story sucked me in – keeping me on the edge of my seat and captivated with each word. This is one of those books that I am not quite sure why I waited so long to start and in the end I was kicking myself for putting it off for so long. This book consumed me and I found myself not wanting to put it down for even a second.The Girl on the Train will entrance you with the almost lyrical prose and challenge you as you try to peel back the many layers of the complex story.  The story is told from three POV’s and the author switches perspectives flawlessly throughout.  It is extremely well-written and the plot flowed smoothly and effortlessly.  Ms. Hawkins is a new author for me, but one that I will be on the lookout for in the future.  This book is some seriously good writing and one that will appeal to anyone looking for a suspenseful and thrilling read.  But be warned…once you start, you will not want to put it down, so just be prepared for life to be put on hold until the last page is turned."
"Awful, degrading and boring"
"It definitely kept my attention as I couldn't put it down but, I couldn't help thinking I had read this before. Both of Gillian Flynns novels, Gone girl and Dark places I feel were the muse behind this one."
"I had read so much about this book that I was expecting great things so I was a little disappointed at first. But then, the more I read the better the book got and I hope I'm not pushing this too far, but it moved along faster and faster the more I read - like a train gaining speed. I have to say there were some elements of Gone Girl, but only fleetingly. The best part was I never guessed the perpetrator so it was a big surprise. Overall, really enjoyed this book."
"Loved this story.  I don't sit down and read a lot because of books like this.  Once I got started, it's all I could think about.  I sat around reading and getting nothing else done until I finished the book.  What a nice relaxing time that was."
I read this after it was recommended to me by Kindle First. At first I was a bit confused as to how it was written and took a little bit of pages to get the hang of the style of writing and the flipping back and forth of character writings.  It was very twisting and turning and you didn't know who or what the outcome was going to be.  The ending was definitely a shocker to me and I did not expect that to happen. But thats the beauty of mystery novels is some of them you can predict and others you just don't know until you finally finish the last page.
I finished this book minutes ago and it was just okay. I am 31 years old... It took me 5 hours over 3 days to read it. The first third of the book is slow. The middle of the book is okay and the final third was a bit more entertaining. I am surprised this title became a bestseller. It might be a good read for a teenage girl in college. The vocabulary is simple and boring. I am an avid reader and I am not impressed. It was okay for a simple book if you are really bored or need to pass time on a flight.
"I can't tell you how much I loved this book.  I love suspense, drama, twists, and this book delivers.  I'm not one of those loathsome people who write praise reviews for a living.  This is really good!!!!"
I was led to this book by the buzz of the ladies at the book club and the new movie trailer. Good story but it did drag a bit in the beginning. The twist at the end was not as shocking if you paid attention to the bread crumbs.  Solid reading.
"In order to understand how the story unfolds read the synopsis first.  I was confused until I immediately went back and did just this.  I didn't want my confusion to delay my understanding of the character development.  Once I did this, I couldn't put my kindle down.  I love books like this because you can forget all else and enter the world of the characters and all else in your life disappears.  In the same fashion as ""Gone Girl,"" there are twists and turns and a surprise ending.  I wasn't able to guess what was coming until the very end.  You'll enjoy this book immensely.  This book will be a good movie if screenwriter gets it right."
So many people living a lie. The characters drawn into the story and the twist each character adds to the story. I had an idea as to how it would end but the storyline. Kept me from being sure until the end
I could read this again and again.
"This was a mesmerizing read. Each plot twist and development compelled me to read more of the book. The story conjured echoes of Gillian Flynn's ""Gone Girl,"" but they are distinctly different works. Rachel is a confounding narrator, and equally infuriating character. Her personal flaws and repeated misinterpretations of other characters' intentions are key to the novel. If you can't accept Rachel, you probably won't enjoy the story. The chapters told from the other characters' perspectives enriched the storytelling and mystery. An entertaining, escapist read."
"This book was recommended to me several times and it did not disappoint. I couldn't put it down and finished it much faster than I've finished any book in the last few years. If you're a fan of Gone Girl, you'll love this."
A very enjoyable read. Characters were well developed- I enjoyed the 'autobiographical' approach by the author. Kept me guessing until almost the end of the book as to the villain. I felt the end of the story was a little abrupt and found that disappointing .... guess I wanted the 'happy (or at least sober) ending' to be spelt out a bit more!
"Addictive behaviors,dysfunctional characters, lies, substance abuse.  Seems like this book has it all.  The plot thickens with every chapter. This is definitely not light hearted reading.  The ending was a bit of a surprise, and although I would say that this was not an enjoyable read, I found myself caught up into the character's lives and anxious to find out how it would all end."
Well written and liked the idea of telling the story from the perspective of 3 different characters in the story. There was something about the setting and the description of the street that evoked life in Britain for me even though it is 15 years since I left the UK.
"This book had me hooked almost immediately. The craziness of Rachel's drinking and her obsession with her ex husband, the mystery of Megan, and all the drama that surrounded Rachel kept me up late wanting more."
"Holy. Cow. What an incredible, edge of your seat kind of book. This book reminded me somewhat of Gone Girl, but it was not as vulgar. If you love thrillers or mystery books that continue to keep you guessing then you should read this book! It was incredible! The first couple chapters were confusing for me, but I finally figured it out. Pay attention to the dates and also who the chapter is focusing on, hint: the name of the chapter is the name of the person that chapter focuses on. :) Great book! I loved reading this and would recommend it to anyone who loves a little psychological thrill!"
"It was a great book,you would never have guessed. I wish there was closer for Scott. There should  have been some justice for Rachel,some way of her not seen as not so attractive. All in all a must read."
This book kept my attention from start to finish. The writing was so vivid that I felt my pulse quickening as I read. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys suspense and psychological thrillers.
"This was an excellent book, I couldn't put it down.  In the end it became somewhat predictable, but I am not sure if that was the intention, nor did it make it easier as I was still waiting for the next twist.  Well worth reading."
I could not put this story down. It was so haunting! I was even compelled to purchase the audio so I could continue listening to the story as I drove to and from work and running my errands. Moral of the story: Don't trust anyone.
"Great suspense novel, I literally couldn't put it down and read the entire thing in a few days which I never do. It did remind me a little of Gone Girl, not quite as many twists and turns but sucked me in just as much if not more."
"Very similar to Gone Girl, not as dark but still a page turner. I liked how the author stuck to fort person accounts but it did become confusing keeping the dates straight. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a quick thriller read."
"A very good read.  Sometimes hard to follow, but still held my interest.  I found it difficult to remember who was narrating when.  I found I needed to often go back to the beginning of sections to recall who was then speaking."
"I just didn't think this book was that great.  I wasn't crazy about the author's writing style and found the characters extremely unlikable.  I only finished it because I kept waiting for it to get better, because everyone loved this book. Then again, I absolutely hated Gone Girl and everyone said this book was ""the next Gone girl""; so I probably should have know better."
Mediocre. I read this out of curiosity and was highly disappointed. Yes it'seems similar to Gone Girl in the sense that it's a mystery story and all the characters are terrible  people but the similarities end there. Not remotely as exciting.
Very interesting story with lots of turns and twists. I do think that Rachel's character was a bit over developed and at times it seemed like a task to listen to her drone on about herself. But once you get over that hurdle (about half way through to book) it's hard to put down.
"I lost hours of sleep reading this book.  It was recommended by a friend, and I was a bit skeptical. Overall, it's one of the most enjoyable books I've read lately, and I read 2 to 3 books per week at times.  Hope this writer continues to grow and develop twists and turns to keep you turning the page."
"I was immediately swept up in this book. The character development was believable and thorough. The insight into their lives was creepy and real.  Real lives are messy and unhappy sometimes. I thought this book brought that to light and then preceded to twist it and distort it till you were on the edge of your seat. I was slightly disappointed with the ending,but I would totally recommend it."
A surprise around every turn. Love a thriller that keeps you wondering if you will ever get an answer. Couldn't put it down.... read till my eyes were blurred! Loved this book. Can't wait to see the movie.
"I enjoyed everything about this book. The characters were interesting, the premise fascinating, and the descriptions vivid enough so that I could see what the girl on the train saw. When I read this, I had no idea that it would become the spectacular hit that it is. I just knew I thoroughly enjoyed it and couldn't put it down."
"The first half of the book was overkill with the drinking problem,seemingly mental problems and self pity. Itt became tiresome. It wasn't until 50% of the way through that it became more interesting and I decided to hang in there to find out the ending."
This is not a happy story.  And you have to pay attention to what the characters are doing.  I found myself lost a few times.  I'm glad I read it.  It was interesting.  But it wasn't my favorite book.
"The quality of writing keeps the story from just playing like a Lifetime movie of the week. I loved the characterization of Rachel. Very descriptive on what it's like to be a depressive alcoholic. Predictability was about 55% since there aren't many characters, but that doesn't stop the momentum. Good beach reading."
"The book keeps you engaged switching from one character to another throughout the book.  There is no twist, just a mystery that most readers should be able to figure out about halfway through the book."
"I'm not quite sure whether I liked this book or not.  It was profoundly disturbing with its twisted plots and characters.  It held my attention and was deftly written, which is the reason I gave it 4 stars.  However, it was difficult to follow and often difficult to absorb.It was definitely not a genre I particularly enjoy, having read it only as a book club assignment, but it's challenging to read outside ones comfort zone occasionally.  I just prefer a diversion from the sordid sadness in our society...rather than a reminder."
"Very disappointing. I found myself skipping pages hoping it would get better, but it never did. Reading the story from a pathetic drunk's perspective made for a painful read."
"A. Book with a slow start that can only pick up as more lives are involved. In our book club someone called it Hitcockese, but I'm not sure I would. I gave it five starts because I thought it always had a story with a purpose."
"It was just ok for me. A bit slow moving and never really had the urge to NEED to read the next chapter. I don't feel my time was wasted on the book, but it's not something I'd read again. At the risk of sounding sexist, I think females would typically enjoy this one more, as I like a bit more suspense and action than this provided. It was a bit more like a Lifetime story if you prefer that sort of thing."
"Redundant, whiny, slow, pitiful and uninteresting characters. Flashbacks, more flashbacks, different dull character point of view. I am 34% in on this book and dread picking it up. Trying to figure out HOW there is a movie to be released. There is NO substance."
"After enduring my wife's prodding to read this book hovering atop the best seller list for so long, I read it, and marvel with great admiration at the superb marketing that propelled a middling story of totally screwed up people to make so much money. It's not that there is anything wrong with it--after all I kept reading,but wonder why. I still recommend it if you have nothing better to do."
"Too weird for my taste in novels. There is great character development & detail, but it is all so bizarre. The entire book is sad, depressing & gloomy.  It rains all the time.  There is never hope. Most of the novel is unbelievable. I had a hard time imagining that this could actually happen."
"I didn't realize it was about murder and abuse and pathological liars.  Had I realized, I would not have chosen to read it.  Now that I am finished I appreciate The character development and story line as being very well written."
"I thought this was a fabulous book.  Could not put it down.  Reminded me a lot of the ""Gone Girl"".  It definitely kept you on the edge and it had a great ending.  I liked that it was written in alternating persons, so you saw it from each one's view.  I won't go into any details as I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but it is a great book and look forward to more of her writing."
"I enjoyed this novel, with it's twists and turns throughout the whole novel. Just when I thought I had it all figured out, I would find another twist was in store for me. I had to remember to look at the chapter headings to see who was talking in the chapter. Otherwise, I would be totally confused. I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys a good read with a surprise ending!"
"This book for me started slow. I had a time keeping up with the three women characters. It soon picked up and was very hard to put down. Each woman we could all relate to. Sometimes life brings about changes that are hard to accept. We refuse to let go, so we hang on however we can. We also become allies with those whom we accuse of taken what's precious from us. Good read!"
Well done psychological type novel.  It's vivid and leaves lasting impressions of settings.  The characters were not likable but I don't think they needed to be when the main thing was the suspense and figuring out just what was going on after Rachel views what she does from the train.  Having the chapters be from the three women's views is very good and I had to keep reading to see what was happening!
"It was interesting, at times confusing, but now I know that was by design. I would recommend it because it's different than the other stuff out there, it's well written and you care about the characters. Once I got into it's rhythm it held my interest and I wanted to see it through. That says something since I currently have about 4 half finished books on tap!"
"Really engaging, and intriguing all the way to the end. Created a real sense of images that came and went and were hard to integrate. You got the same feeling that Rachel had -- that there was something she could not put her finger on. Very interesting structure. Would make a great movie."
The story is told through the inner experience of each of its protagonists and not always in a linear time sequence. The author develops real characters in ways that retell the events with surprising shifts - a wonderful read.
"The Girl on the Train is a fascinating, if a bit depressing, story of a girl who gets all tangled up in the lives of people she observes while riding the train back and forth to London each day. But her image of the lives of the people she observes turns out to be quite different than she expected. The girl is an emotional wreck, exasperated by addiction to alcohol. She deceives her roommate into believing she is still going to a job from which she had been fired months earlier. The story is full of twists and turns, enough surprises to keep me reading it with interest till the end."
"I have to say, once I picked up this book, I could not put it down (I lost some sleep over it).  It is very well written, with each chapter changing from character to character and also past an present.  It was done in a way that it was very easy to follow.  It has romance, betrayal, murder, mystery, self-destructive behaviors and more.  It has been compared to Gone Girl and I have to agree with that.  Fast, thrilling read."
The story has a lot about character interaction- it was a bit heavy on the emotional relationship side... The book takes a while to develop the complex characters and by the time all these complexities were added up... i stopped reading.
Great writing of a great story. Slow at times but the last 100 pages you cannot put down. I love the way she writes with each female receiving their own point of view. Great book! Can't wait to see what they do with the movie.
The story is great and it's a fast read.  My only issue is I think this could have been one book and not a 3 book series.  Read the second book now have to wait until book 3 comes out.  If I would have known that I would have waited to real all three after the 3rd one is released.  That being said I really enjoy the characters and can't wait to find out what is going on with them.
"An okay read; kept me thinking while I spent time thinking how the various characters related to each other and what all that meant. The ending sort of surprised me. Yes, the mystery is solved, but it felt like a very abrupt end without real closure. I probably wouldn't have chosen this book to read if it wasn't the next Book Club book."
"Seemed disorganized.  I was well into the book before I was able to connect the characters to each other and to see how their individual stories were separate, then intertwined.  The conclusion was swift and in just a few pages wrapped up everything in a satisfactory way. Reading about Rachel was very disturbing and having her roommate forgive and help in such forgiving and self-sacrificing  way seemed unrealistic.  All the female characters were severely flawed.  The men seemed to be untrustworthy."
"Okay. not as great as the hype. But engaging. Representing a coomon experience of the eay in which all this pieces fall into place once you know who is lying, and in retrospect the clues were all around."
i was given this book by a co-worker. i LOVE a good mystery and was intrigued by how this author wrote in diary form. it was an excellent choice for dramatic effect. read lots and lots of books and this was right up there with the best of them. bravo
I couldn't put this book down! It was an incredibly easy-to-read story and the storyline moved quickly. I enjoy books that are narrated by alternating characters and I found the characters to be well-developed.
"This is a decent book for the Kindle price of $6 or so, but I'm happy I did not spend more or I would've been very disappointed.  I wanted to see what the hype was all about and I do not believe it lived up to the hype.  Other reviewers had mentioned not liking any of the characters, & I completely agree.  I don't know if that was by design, but it didn't work for me.  It had some twists, but overall, I got bored with Rachel getting drunk, & both Megan & Anna hating their lives.  Rachel thinking with clarity at the very end seemed forced in an effort to end the book."
"Wow. Couldn't put it down. Even the first half, which moves slow, felt like it was building. Like the slow ascent of a roller coaster when you realize every click is promising a heart stopping descent."
Book was good but the paperback entirely fell apart...kinda makes it hard to put it back on my book shelf or let friends borrow it...contacted for replacement. Hoping the second doesn't fall apart. I read it in under 4 days.
"This is one of those books when you finish you just to have to ponder it for a few minutes.  I thought it was a good book because I had to finish it, but I can't say I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The main character is not exactly endearing--most alcoholics are not--but she had a willing and good heart.  This is a terrible pun but reading this book is like staring at a train wreck you just can't look away and therefore I just  to see how it all sorted out in the end.  While this doesn't seem like a favorable review I'd loved for my friends to read just so we could talk about the balance of the relationships between characters."
This was a page turning story but I gave it four stars because there were a few places that confused me and I had to go back and reread to get it straight in my thoughts. I can't wait to see the movie!!
The first ten pages made me wonder about the writing. Very choppy. But then it became quite engaging and you realize how well she entered into the character's psychology and personality. Very well done and a unique thriller.
"Well I was a little disappointed.  From all the reviews, I was expecting so much more.  By the middle of the story I knew where it was going.  I read the  the book in one day  hope the movie is better."
"This book cannot be put down. It tears at you to keep reading, to feel the disorientation that alcohol causes, to question what you think you know.  Just like Rachel questions what she knows, what her blackouts have obscured.  If you are in recovery, you fear each drink she reaches for..if you haven't had the obsession you might think her amusing, pathetic.  Both are true, but her disease and desire are robbing her of her sanity and clarity is too far away.  Read this book and think about the disorientation this author throws at you with her excellent perspective and knowledge.  It makes you what lies you might uncover in your own life."
"So did I love this book? I would have to say no. Not because it wasn't a great book. It was exquisitely written. And very much along the lines of Gone Girl as it stops you in your tracks and lingers long after the last page has been read. Unlike, Gone Girl which left me angry at the ending, the ending to this book was fitting because how else can you possibly end a book like this? But, now, I'm left with a horrible feeling of melancholy that I must deal with.Is it worth the read? Definitely. But I think my next book should be about rainbows and unicorns."
"Expected a better story from a NY Times best seller. Really hard to get into the story line and three first person confusing, repetitive. Kept waiting for something to happen then re reading the same dreary and depressing story from three very sick women. Only came together the last three chapters.Those chapters, however, were bizarre and ending unexpected. Wish I'd saved my money."
For me a great suspense is unpredictable and this book definitely fit the bill. I wasn't able to figure out who the killer was until the author wanted me to. The writing was impeccable and the story line was original. I gave four stars instead of five because parts of the book were a bit slow moving but overall this was a great read and I would highly recommend it.
"On the positive side, I was able to read through clear to the end despite the story not being nearly as compelling as I expected.  None of the characters were particularly likeable and it's hard to get deeply involved in a story if it doesn't have at least one person you can really care about. The book had some good moments but overall it just seemed like a lot of effort for very little payoff."
"As unreliable narrated stories go, this on is a doozie!  As the story unfolded I found myself following the twists and turns avidly, and reinterpreting the narrator over and over.  The basic set up required a stretch of imagination for me, but once I slipped into her world I couldn't stop.  This was one of those books that I found myself losing track of time, and I enjoyed it very much."
"Slow start.  Took me awhile to get the gist of the main characters.  My feelings for the main character were sympathy and empathy.  I felt like I was feeling her pain but then every time she drank, I was angry with her.  Excellent story with a surprising ending."
"Wow, an interesting well written book,  it kept me guessing until nearly the very end as to what had all happened and why.  Characters were all people who had trouble of their own now or in the past and it was hard to know who was good and who was bad.  Enjoyed this book a lot..."
"I may have hung on for about a quarter of the book. I got tired of the drug and alcohol-addled remblings.There may have been violence and sexual content, but I gave up before that occurred.  I kept waiting for something, anything, to happen. It didn't."
"I wasn't sure about this book after I read the sample, but I'm happy I ordered the full book. I ended up reading it in 2 days!  The intertwining of the characters was done in a interesting way. Very believable how this whole scenario could of take place. Makes your realize how relationships can make or break a person."
One of the best books I've read in a long time. WAY better than Gone Girl.  All characters a bit flawed but human.  Amazing how people can so easily become delusional when the reality of life collides with the expectations we have.  Some loose ends I would have liked to have been addressed in an epilog but I guess it's ok to leave some things to the imagination.  Will read more by this author I think.
"This story is just crazy.  Rachel is such a mess and if you've ever thought someone's life is perfect, most likely it's not!  Once I started reading I couldn't put it down.  Then the conclusion, that sure surprised me.  A good read.  You definitely can get caught up in their lives!"
"Although it got better at the end, this was a difficult book to motivate myself to read.  It moves slowly, and the reader has to keep flipping back to check the dates of the sections.  I could not identify or empathize or even sympathize with any of the characters."
"espite the alternating voices in each chapter, there is a similarity so that it becomes very boring---it seems that all the characters are covering the same time spans in the same voice.  It could have been done as a short story for what it revealed, or the depth of exploration and color.  And that  leading lady is an unlikable character"
"The main narrator is a very damaged woman: alcoholic, unemployed and still suffering from a divorce. There is a missing woman and this character thinks she knows something, but is so unreliable as a witness the police dismiss her.Already being made into a film. And it could be a very good one."
"I heard that this book was great and I would be unable to put it down. A little slow at first, itwas hard to follow, but as I got further into it, the story proved to be a good one and I did finish it quickly.Should be a great movie !"
"A superbly written suspense story with incredibly intricate psychological insights into various human conditions.  I found it more engrossing than Gone Girl with a plot which is both believable and riviting. I am amazed at some of the poor reviews, these reviewers revealing a great deal about their own naivete and lack of psychological mindedness."
"Started it. Depressing. Haven't finished it because the idea of a divorced, out of work woman who just can't get it together was sort of a downer. I wish I could get past that part to the mystery, but it just drags on too long. . .Spent way too much on the pre-order, Not worth the hype and I can't imagine how they are going to make a decent movie out of this.  Pass for something by John Grisham!"
"I thought this book was dark, depressing and ended poorly.  I also do not think think the author described the characters at all.  I had a hard time connecting to the characters and getting a visual image to go with their story.  I wasted a few hours of my life...."
I really enoyed the book. It was fast moving and kept me wondering what was going on.  If your looking for something to read I would recommend this. It's not to heavy in details but not skimpy. Good for an easy enjoyable story.
"I didn't want to read this book, but my book club selected it and I want to be part of the discussion. Has all the earmarks of the giant best seller it is - short chapters, no challenging vocabulary words or complex ideas, and just enough sexual references to satisfy those who require that. An unsatisfying read about damaged, unlikable people. Time wasted..."
"I had a lot of lead up to this book before reading it. I finished it through, perhaps personal preference but I never fully identified with Rachel and it made it hard to be empathetic to her character. The whole Jess and Jason thing was a little creepy to me as well. Because I could never really identify with some of the key characters it made for just an OK read."
"I hated this book a lot less than I thought I would. I read it for a book club, and thrillers are not generally my genre of choice. During the first couple of chapters, I thought I wouldn't be able to finish it because the protagonist was so whiny and annoying. While she remained somewhat of an unsympathetic character throughout and I don't know that I found the ending entirely plausible, the plot was compelling and the writing was strong throughout. It was a good quick read - a true page-turner."
"I have enjoyed enormously reading this book. The way the story is told, like in a journal, through the words of 3 different characters, made me see everything happening not like a spectator but like I was also invoved."
"The real shame is that Alfred Hitchcock is dead and therefore unable to film this book. It echoes some of his classics - you will find touches of ""Rear Window,"" ""Spellbound,"" and ""Suspicion,"" mixed with a heavy dollop of a famous non-Hitchcock work, ""Gaslight.""Other reviewers have given summaries, so I won't attempt to do it here; I would be too afraid to leave potential spoilers. All I can say to those idly picking it up is to stay with it: for quite a few pages I just wasn't, as they say, ""feeling it."" Suddenly it snapped on me like a mousetrap and I couldn't escape its grasp."
"The book reminded me in some way of ""Gone Girl"" another story with unlikable characters.  I found this cast of characters complex but not people I would like to know.  The chapter shift of characters was confusing at times and difficult to move easily from one to another.  Not highly recommended, but a fast read."
"The comparisons to Gillian Flynn's style are spot on, though Hawkins tries to up the ante by using three unreliable narrators and planting obvious seeds of doubt in just about every character, major and supporting. The book is well-written, but where Hawkins falls short is in making Rachel or any of the main characters likeable - or even relatable. It's hard to to remain riveted by a mystery in which the protagonist is so weak, that you just don't really care what happens to her at all."
"3.5 rating this book was a page turner and it was very reminiscent of A Hithcocks Rear Window' I like it better than Gone Girl , the characters similar to the characters in Gone Girl....all pathetic and UN likeable' . This genre does not lead to up lifting thought regarding humanity--no waxing nostalgic regarding the depths of beauty within the human spirit! No no no it's good old fashion film noir and don't be surprised if you see the ungainly profile of SIR ALFRED HITCHCOCK as you close the last page (that you have stayed up till 3:00AM to finish)Happy Reading!)"
The writing is so good I can't describe it. I literally put the book down several times because I was feeling so caught up in it and I didn't want to see what happened next.... but I did at the same time.
Incredible.  Quite a feat for what I understand to be the author's first novel.  The ending was a real shock.  DO NOT see the movie until you have read the book!  It would be a shame to spoil the surprise
"Wanted to read the book before seeing the movie. Basically it's a very interesting, gripping story. My complaint is that the ending seems incomplete or rushed. Maybe the movie ending will be handled better."
"I initially bought this book 2 weeks ago to read on a cruise. I didn't end up reading the book on the cruise but decided to actually pick it up about a week ago.I found it to be fast paced without the use of any deep thinking. I enjoyed the un-reliable narrator aspect of it which definitely kept me turning the pages.Although I had my suspicions of the actual perp about halfway through the book, I kept wondering if there would be a big turn all the way up to the big reveal.Good read on a rainy day."
"Ha!  What a great book for psychology majors.  How in the world do women with low self-esteem create their own inner drama.  Well, here you are; three women creating seemingly logical murderous drama making themselves and the men they love nuts.  Very well written from the moment you step on the train with the first girl and you can't put the book down.  An interesting therapist is part of the tale.  I'm not sure he helped anyone. On the other hand perhaps he gave some subtle help for a memory blocked by an alcoholic blackout.  Get on the train if you dare and let these women take you on their flawed mind-game trips."
The ending was the best part... If you can make it to the end through the long back and forth readings. It reminded me a lot of the book Gone Girl. It's worth the read but I like a page turner and his just wasn't that for me until the ending .
I found myself completely mesmerized by the descriptive storytelling in this novel.  The author was able to truly convey such amazing detail in her writing that I am actually upset that this book had to end!!!
"It was a great story. I can't believe I finished it. I want more. I'm still in shock at the twist in the end. I don't like disturbing story lines with lots of blood or heart wrenching topics. It's a smooth read with a great story line. Not too disturbing, not too much blood or sex. You'll only stay up at night from being unable to put the book down, not from nightmares. I just loved it. I can't wait for the movie to come out."
"Interesting story but a number of elements seemed highly unlikely.  From the beginning, the characters were presented as highly dysfunctional. I suppose that was supposed to add to the mystery of identifying the person responsible for Jess' disappearance. As a reader, I felt that they all needed intense therapy. It was a very creative and clever plot that could have evolved more realistically. I would recommend you read it as many people have not been as bothered by psychology."
"This book draws you in. It takes you into a sea of emotions, up and down, love and hate, pity and disgust. You will feel for each of the characters. You won't be sure of the killer until the last page!"
I found this book to be very captivating.  The author was able to take you into the mind of the characters as if you were living the story along with them.  It was very hard to put this book down once I get started.
"Loved it. Great thriller, didn't figure it out till close to the end. Not predictable like most books. My coworker read it too and we laughed because in the novel the main character is supposed to be fat but in the movie Emily Blunt is more famished looking. Typical Hollywood."
"This was a good book with good characterization. The authors movement from scene to scene and character to character kept the pace quick. The ending was easy to anticipate, what the journey to get there was a good one."
"Overall, a good read. The plot and they way the book/chapters were formatted were interesting and kept me wanting to read in and figure out what happens. However, at times I found my myself simply wanting to continue reading not because I was enjoying the story, but more because I just wanted to know how it ended and ""who did it."" Being a fan of more complex writing styles and literary-type books this was not a book I'd normally read, however for those who enjoy a good mystery/drama with a primarily female-focused storyline, you may like this."
"Could Not Stop Reading This Book! Whenever I had to stop, I was thinking about the characters and the recent events. Devoured it in a day. Cannot wait to read her next novel. I haven't seen the movie, but I intend to watch it."
"The flow of the book was choppy and somewhat hard to follow.  The characters were not conducive to empathy.  However in defense of the author, maybe this is the what she wants.  The last third of the book was was a page turner.  The ending however was not unexpected."
"Did not see the end coming. Great character development, they were believable and grew throughout the story. Rachael was a great character and the nuances of her  were believable and we all know one or have known a Rachael. I enjoyed the read and it was for our Book Club, my pick. I think the characters are deep enough for the ladies to pick apart and discuss."
It took me a long while to get into the story but then bam all of a sudden couldn't put it down until it was finished.  Great book has your mind twisting and turning.  Glad I read the book and did not go see the movie.  Excellent.
"The author writes very well.  It was a little tough to read, not because the writing style isn't great, but because the character is not in a good place and she made me a little uncomfortable because of her bad choices.  It was essential to the story to be written that way.  Interesting story and the plot is carried out very well.  I enjoyed the book very much."
"If you enjoy well developed introspective, psychologically edgy mysteries, this book is for you."
"The book is absolute gripping, I couldn't put it down. The best book I read in a very long time."
Great read.
"Get 47% through and then it will be worthwhile! Finally, a story with a believable ending! (Four more words required)."
"An unreliable blackout alcoholic narrator. She can not stay away from her ex. She doesn't remember details, but she was in the area when the second wife disappeared. She keeps having sex with suspects. She blabs what she thinks she knows to the wrong people. She's an every woman in search of what went so terribly wrong to this woman and to herself. I really enjoyed this book!"
"This was a crazy ride!  Told in the voices of three women whose lives become entangled with disastrous results.  One is a drunk, one is a little crazy, and the third is obsessed with jealousy over her husband's first wife, although this is somewhat justified.  Once you're into this one it's hard to put down.  What are these people going to do next?  There is some depth of character as the women ponder how they ended up where they did; why they made those choices that got them to the frightening place they all end up in.  This puts this novel a bit above your run-of-the-mill suspense/mystery."
"Ok, so I read that people were comparing this to Gone Girl.  Too bad, because although I loved gone girl, the ending sucked.  I liked this book, the beginning was slow. Rachel was not a likable character. I just can't sympathize with a drunk who constantly lets herself go.  But that's the whole point of the book. To make the bad characters... Good.  In the end, everyone that annoyed me came out on top.  Good job.  Read this book, you'll be happy"
Very engaging story.  I couldn't put it down.  Every new page presents you with a new idea of what really happened.  I enjoyed the fact that at times you weren't really sure whether the narrator was really reliable or not- it added another whole mysterious level to the tale.
Pulled me in right from the start. I'd been putting off reading this as I sometimes find that books that people rave about are often disappointing to me. Not this one. Highly recommended. Amazing first book ... I look forward to more from this author.
"Very intriguing plot/story, if you can look beyond the main character's many flaws. It was often very difficult to read from Rachel's point of view, but the suspense in wanting to know what happened to her and Megan will compel you to continue reading."
"A pager turner from the beginning.  I thought the author did an excellent job developing the characters.  I actually thought that the characters were more intriguing than the plot.  I was a little disappointed with the ending... it was not all unexpected, and the final confrontation was a little extreme.  However, even with that said, I thought it was an excellent read and highly recommend the book."
"Surprisingly I loved Girl On The Train.  I usually only like books where at least one of the character has redeemable qualities, but in the book everyone is kind of pathetic.  However, Paula Hawkins develops these pathetic characters in a way that makes you feel sorry for them, and actually relate to some of their characteristics (or should I say flaws).  I think we've all at some point driven/ridden down the road and wondered what the people we saw were doing, and this book takes that type of voyeurism to the extreme.  The mystery draws you in and the twists keep you moving steadily along."
"I absolutely loved this book.  It was a real page turner!  I had all sorts of emotions from both liking and hating Rachel, then feeling sorry for her and back to hating her again for her weakness.  At the end I was totally relating to her and pulling for her to have a good future.  In fact, I still think of her almost as if she was a real person that I know and I find myself hoping that she is happy and doing well.  Now, I call that a good book.Barbara Miller Whitton"
Whaat? A contrived plot with not much substance. Not enough detail about characters to elicit emotion for them. Except the alcoholic; and the emotion I felt was disgust..
"This novel captivated me from the beginning. Maybe it was how normally flawed the main character was? How realistically she was portrayed? How easy it was to believe she was real? This novel wasn't deep or life changing, but it was very readable and entertaining. For me, I'd describe it not as the main course, or even the vegetable or potatoes. No, it is more like the popcorn in the movie theater, that has just enough butter and salt to make you take long drags on your soda and lick your fingers from time to time."
"Page after page, each person's mind is revealed in all its complexities.  Since you are experiencing events the way each one perceives them, you, the reader, have a fascinating time figuring out what's real.  Exciting!"
Thanks to the heat wave I got to read this page-turner in 3 days.  Three very flawed women and one lying bastard-all unhappy with what they had and thinking something better was either out of his/her grasp or belonged to someone else.
"I lost hours of sleep reading this book.  It was recommended by a friend, and I was a bit skeptical. Overall, it's one of the most enjoyable books I've read lately, and I read 2 to 3 books per week at times.  Hope this writer continues to grow and develop twists and turns to keep you turning the page."
"Engaging read. Couldn't put the book down (except when I absolutely had to). Read it in two sittings. Now, I'm going to look for more books by this author!  Excellent writing! Kept me on the edge of my seat!!"
"Written kind of in a strange way, but once you get past that, it's a page-turner. I guessed the ""plot twist"" almost halfway through so it was fun to discover that I was right. Ending was slightly disappointing"
This sounded like my kind of mystery book.  What ruined it for me was the main character.  I couldn't sympathize or empathize with her at all.  I know she had some issues but she was constantly getting hit on the head and/or drinking herself into oblivion.  It wasn't until the end that she finally did something about her situation.  I liked the authors writing but not the story - I found it very depressing.
"This was a fast read for me, it kept my interest throughout but I did not like any of the personalities of any characters. They all drove me crazy in some way. I kept reading it just to find out who did it.  This won't stop me from any of Paula Hawkins other books, just did not like this particular book."
"This is a very, unsettling, thought-provoking novel, and quite the thriller. I. Could. Not. Put. This. Book. Down. The stories of the same event are told in the voices of the three main characters: Rachel, Megan, and Anna. There was so much in Rachel's thought process I could relate to, not necessarily her same issues, but the way she talked things out in her head seemed so much like I do. This is really a dark book about three women finding themselves in very different ways. As much as I loved the book, I hope the next few books I read aren't so dark and heavy."
"I could not put this down! The train ride of your life within the pages of this novel. Lives are so entwined in this story of cheating, alcoholism, and murder. Rachel is the barren Ex, who loses her husband because she lets depression lead her to alcohol. He moves his mistress into her home and marries her and they have the baby, Rachel always wanted. Now everyday, Rachel must pass her old home on the train and see her once happy life being played out by her ex-husband and his new wife, Anna. Two doors down she also watches her imaginary couple, who she knows must be living the perfect life, a life she longs for too."
"A disjointed story about a delusional alcholic told in a rambling nonsensical fashion. If I could find a way to return this book, I surely would but I already paid for it. Why this book went to publication or received glowing accolades and sales defies logic. Do not be taken in. Go to your nearest library, and save your self 13 dollars."
"I had heard mixed reviews about this book, so I wasn't sure how I was going to like it.  I did enjoy the book and never would have guessed who the killer turned out to be, so that was a plus.  It reminded me a bit of Gone Girl, but I liked the characters in this book so much better.  I can pictures Melissa McCarthy starring in the movie version!"
"I am not into reading all that much, but this book is so suspenseful! I could not put it down. Girl on the Train is very well written and keeps the reader on the edge. I have three kids under 14 and I was able to put this book away in 3 days. I loved it! I hope this author writes more books like this."
More entertaining and fun than I ever expected. I just kept thinking 'what's is she doing!' Though out the whole book. Moves along and I just had to keep reading it every chance I got. Of course a murder mystery isn't supposed to be humorous but I had to chuckle a number of times. The absurdity I guess. I am not big on fiction but I do enjoy an entertaining read. Very recommended as such.
"This was not worth the time, even though it was so easy to read it didn't take up too much. The characters aren't likable in any way, just pathetic and badly behaved. The murder mystery aspect is so drawn out as to make it a chore to get through, instead of captivating & thrilling. It was unoriginal, the writing was just okay, and the characters sucked."
"The Girl on the Train is a thrilling book packed with mystery and intrigue. It gives readers insight into the minds of three separate women and how their lives and choices impact who they become, what they do, and how they survive all the while exploring the dangerous disappearance and death of one of them."
Ms. Hawkins did a super job of leading you deeper & deeper into the heroines troubled world.  You can't help but feel sorry for her but annoyed too as the choices she makes never seem the right ones. I just had to read that next page to find out what she was going to do this time.
"Twists and turns are what made this book. I thoroughly enjoyed it, as well as all of the members of my book club. I did not suspect the murderer until the author wanted me to. There were clues, but they were very subtle. I would definitely recommend reading it, especially before the movie comes out."
It is a good book- switches from three different women's perspective. I thought some parts dragged on a bit and could have been cut short but over all a great read. It keeps you guessing until the end. I would recommend reading it.
"I keep reading that we MUST read this book and it's on the best seller lists.  I just didn't get that.  I thought the characters were stupid,shallow and not to be believed.  It just was something that disappointed me from the get-go.  A waste of money."
"This was a pretty good read. It was well-written, and suspenseful--it definitely held my attention. It was pretty heavy, though. It deals with alcoholism, domestic violence, murder. Generally it left me feeling pretty sad. Not my best choice of books to read on the beach."
It was interesting to see the book written from the perspective of three different women. It was a somber look at alcoholism and relationships. The book kept you involved and anxious. It's a great read!
"I enjoyed the suspense in this novel,  but came away feeling quite let down because of  its over population of negative characters., starting with the narrator, an unattractive, depressed alcoholic , fantasizing her intrusive way into the private lives  of any body and everybody who catches her  invasive attention. Reading  further, one character after another  joins the ranks of residents of this moral wasteland.  . When, at last, our thirty-something ""Nancy Drew"" comes out of her blackout,  the gory, rather contrived ending leaves us feeling rather unwell..  I love a psychological thriller, but...........?"
"This impressive novel starts a little slowly, with chapters alternating between the two major characters.  Rachel is an alcoholic and has been admiring the lives of two people she sees daily while commuting on a train.  The tension builds with a stunning ending, which proves we cannot always know what is going on, either on the outside or certainly the inside of characters, or people.  The train setting was terrific, as I think we always imagine the lives of those around us, whom we do not know, but only see."
"It was fairly predictable, but I still found myself wanting to read it quickly to find out what happened, so the suspense was there. Overall a fun read, since you weren't exactly sure how they would get to the conclusion, but the plot twists were all a bit anticipated."
"It is such a gradual approach, the reality of this book. At first watching the troubled behavior of an alcoholic woman made more real by this author's absolutely astounding grasp on alcoholism and how it affects one.  I thought that was to be the subject matter of the book. Then the creepy feeling that there is so much more evil in this book than first meets the eye. Bizarre acts after compulsive behavior make this a page turner you can't put down. This book makes for a mental disturbance equal to the train that that roars down the tracks, making a setting for murder. I strongly recommend this book."
"Book was great. Kindle Fire has since frozen and Amazon won't replace it. It is just over a year oldand have had several issues. I will not buy from Amazon again.They do not value their customers. The supervisor said, There is nothing more I can do and am ending this call. And she hung up on me.  Spent alot of money for nothing. VERY DISAPDISAPPOINTED AND FRUSTRATED.  A vey unhappy customer and I will tell everyone my story"
"I read this after so many recommendations. I not only had a hard time finishing it, when I did, I was almost angry. ""That's it? That was the suspenseful ending?"" Gone Girl had me breathless. This had me saying ""Agh, whatever."""
"The girl going to work on a commuter train into London every morning develops idyllic fantasies from fleeting glimpses made possible by a caution signal that often slows or even stops the train, giving her a glimpse of the back yards of a neighborhood in which she once lived.  Events in that neighborhood begin the illumination of the private lives of all involved, and includes a growing circle of people which quickly swirls into a vortex of intrigue that brings out their dark sides.  This novel starts at a leisurely pace but continually accelerates until everything breaks."
"The format of the book is amazing. The story is like a roller coaster, I felt thrilled the whole time I was reading it. I couldn't have guessed the antagonist and weirdly enough I felt like I could relate with Rachel."
"This book was not as good as I had been led to believe that it would be. It's narrated by three different people and at first, it's hard to understand who they are and who's talking about what. It was very confusing until the characters were all straightened out. The names of the narrators should be in a darker font, as well, because it is easy to miss the names on the Kindle as you are reading."
She alternates the characters and dates among the chapters so you have to keep track of who you're reading about and when it took place. The story is not told sequentially. The movie would have been very confusing if I had not read the book.
"Great book and in good condition. I really loved the book and was looking for books similar to this psychological thriller. It lead me to pick up try not to breathe by holly seddon. However, I prefer Paula Hawkins writing style."
"Dont know why I got this book, because nothing exciting out there at the moment....I am a ""thriller"" type junkie.....Baldacci, Patterson, etc:So this book was downright sad.  Had a few good moments, if you like white trash novels.....who lives next to train track,  ( none here inBeverly Hills)...oh what the h____.Waiting for another thriller novel ...HELP"
"This is a great book for mystery lovers. It starts a bit slowly, but as the story goes on the pace picks up as will your heart rate until the riveting end. I gave it 5 stars because I couldn't put it down as the story intensified."
"This book was suggested to me after reading Dark Places, which I loved. I do see similarities between the characters, but in this book I found myself not rooting for Rebecca, Anna, or Megan(until she died). These characters are highly unlikable. This isn't necessary a bad thing. It does make for interesting reading. The storyline was well thought out."
"I'm not really a fan of the alternating persons style of narration, but overall, I really did like the book. For me it was hard to get in to at the beginning just because of alternating narration and time. Once I caught the flow I couldn't put it down."
"Then you'll love The Girl on the Train.  I enjoyed the character of Rachel, an interesting perspective on life.  But I found the male characters to be unbelievable and under developed. Also, I'm honestly not a fan of this type of book regardless.  I didn't enjoy Gone Girl or Into the Woods or similar.  I have a feeling this book is fav of those who did enjoy the murder mystery variety."
"Could have been told in 1/2 to 2/3 number  of words. Very tedious at times. I understand that the main character is an addict but her continue u out whining was tedious. Yes, I know that's  what addicts do which makes them as tiresome as she is. Figured out the killer a out 75% of the way thru. Not good."
"A friend told me this was every bit as creepy as Gone Girl. I would disagree. It had me guessing for awhile but about 2/3 of the way through I guessed who the bad guy was. It also lacked the sheer horror factor of Gone Girl. I remember reading that one and wondering if there were really people that twisted in the world. The bad guy in this one was bad, but not psycho twisted. Just my opinion"
"Intriguing and suspenseful from the beginning to the end.  As you read, you are searching for the guilty person and decide on each one at different times during the story. The character development is excellent, in that, you form opinions about each and assign personality traits to each. Remember assumptions may be misleading. To say more would give too much away."
"A psychologic thriller that the author makes even more complicated by having three very flawed narrators,all female and married to or divorced from controlling and violent men. Hawkins shows us right from the outset that things are not as they appear on the surface, compounded by the distorted view of the narrators"
"Rachael, the girl on the train, keeps you engrossed and feeling sorry for her situation. Her memory lost in a drunken stupor, what did she do, what did she see, and who was there? Who is friend and who is foe?"
Amazing novel that has a fantastic twist.I more appreciated the view in to the kind of an alcoholic than I did the story. Maybe I am not alone? What an incredible insight for those that experience alcoholism first hand or through a relative.
"Once I got into this, I wanted to keep reading. The story is told from the viewpoint of three women in chapters that build on themselves. Each chapter reveals something new about that person and gradually there are connections. The women are interesting enough. The main character is a woman who rides a train to work daily and has developed a fantasy about a couple living in a house whose back faces the tracks at a brief stop each day in the commute. But nothing is as it seems . . . . . . . . I enjoyed this book. Recommended."
"I wish 2.5 stars was an option as 2= didn't like it and 3= okay. I was taken with how sad and pathetic the lead character, Rachel, was. But about half way through my patience wore thin for things to tighten up. Her behavior pattern grows tiresome, which perhaps was the author's attempt to present the frustration and fruitless of wanting an addict to change? Despite these complaints, I burned through this pretty quickly, at first from being taken with it, but in the end to just get it over with and move on. 2.5 stars."
"Once I figured out that the story was being told by more than one person, I got very into the book and ended up staying up till 5 a.m. to finish it.  It was very exciting and certainly kept me guessing."
"I don't understand what the hype is about this book. Prior to reading this book, I had read several reviews that it is comparable to Gone Girl, an excellent book, so I was really excited to read it. It is in no way similar to Gone Girl. The characters are completely pathetic, the pace is extremely slow and the outcome was predictable. Two other ladies read this book with me and all three of us have the same consensus that this book was a waste of time and totally boring."
I only gave four stars because of the uncomfortable feelings I had  reading about all the drinking. The story was entertaining other than that; well written. Recommend to friends that love mystery plots.
Kind of confusing at first. I don't really like it as much as I thought I would. But it's so different from the books I usually read and maybe that's why. Will be glad to go back to what I usually read.
"At first I thought the girl in the train was a spirit, haunting her former life from the tracks and keeping her regular routine in tact.  instead, the several perspectives of the characters showed that she was real.  The pieces came together at the end with satisfying closure to a tawdry tale of sadness underlining the ease with which a person can use and abuse another human for selfish needs.  Ann Landers used to write that one can not be taken advantage of without giving permission.  sometimes it takes strength to recognize another's absolute disregard for anyone else."
"Amazing! Fascinating characters, unreliable narrators that made me question if I had read carefully enough. A better Gone Girl than Gone Girl. Rachel is a pitiable and yet relatable protagonist, and Megan and Anna make deliciously loathsome women. I love a novel centered around such rich and complicated female narrators."
I read this book from front to back in just a few days and found it very entertaining. I definately recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Gone Girl or stories in that genre.
"Really need to stick with this from the outset ... easy to lose track if you set the book down for a while.  Not sure why it is ""top rated"" ... a lot of other better reads."
I liked to mystery of the whole book. I usually don't care for mysteries but it was a part of our book club selection so I braved the way to reading. I'm very glad that I did. Very few characters but each well thought out and creatively woven together.
"The story started slowly and was confusing because it kept changing characters.  It was written as each character was telling a story from their point of view.  I kept reading the book because it did become more interesting as the story progressed.  The ending pleased and surprised me, it was a mystery that I never would have thought about."
Very confusing - spent too much time having to re-read to keep characters straight!
"This is a story of nasty dudes and naive women. I loved it. It’s being compared to Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, but that’s not a good comparison. They are both amazing in their own ways and for very different reasons. This book has so many questions that have to be answered. Is Megan dead or did she run away? Both are plausible. Why is Rachel so obsessed with her? Is it just her imagination? Why is Tom so passive of Rachel’s constant intrusions? Who is sleeping with who? Does Anna have any redeeming qualities?The characters are flawed and some are downright detestable. The story focuses on three women: Rachel, the drunk who can’t let go of her ex-husband, Anna, the one who stole him away, and Megan, the beautiful missing woman.Rachel was a great character to read. She is completely broken and her only escape is with alcohol. The story is told from first-person perspective and doesn’t have a whole lot of dialogue, so her chapters were desperate and lonely. I could put myself in her shoes. She is someone who is easy to pity, as she travels the train everyday, pretending to go to a job that she was fired from months ago. Every day she looks at a house, only a few down from where she once lived, and watches a loving couple. She creates a make-believe world around them, perfect in every way. It’s an obvious set-up for disappointment.Anna is not likeable. At no point in the book did I feel anything for her but contempt. She knowingly begins an affair with a married man, none other than Rachel’s husband Tom, and effectively steals him away. Granted, Rachel’s depression makes it easy for her. At one point, while she’s admiring her and Tom’s sleeping baby, she remembers the days of sneaking around with him and admits that she misses being a mistress. She loved the sense of danger and wishes she could go back to it. All she feels towards Rachel is disgust. She was a good chunk of the book and suffice it to say that her chapters filled me with my own sense of disgust, aimed at her.Next is Megan, the one I’m not sure how to feel about. Partly, she reminds me of Anna, with her “I don’t care about anyone but me” attitude, but she also reminds me of Rachel, with her struggle against depression and insomnia. Her tragic past is the only part of her character that I could stand, as the rest of the time she’s thinking purely about herself and her memories of when she ran an art gallery and had men drooling over her. Surely, she would be appalled to be compared to Rachel, who is described as being overweight, drunk, and repulsive. Megan’s selfishness is sometimes nauseating, but then a wee bit of humanity shines through. Ultimately, I felt sorry for her, but I didn’t like her.The men in the story are a puzzle. There’s good and bad. It’s a confusing mess and I wasn’t always sure which man I was reading about through these women’s thoughts. Have no fear, the book did not leave me with a total sense of hopelessness concerning men in general, even though the author did not show them in a positive light.It’s definitely a mystery. I had inklings all the way through, but it wasn’t until about seventy percent through that I said, “Ah-ha!” I’m always impressed with a book that can keep me guessing more than halfway through and this one definitely did. It wasn’t a huge surprise to me, but it was an unpleasant one. In the beginning, everything is up in the air. No one is safe from doubt, not even poor Rachel. Nothing is completely settled until the very end, as it should be, leading to a perfectly short and powerful climax.The end was fulfilling, yet a little disappointing. I do not like happy-happy endings, but this one lacked hope. It was hinted at, but only one of these women gets to speak and her thoughts are still terrified and troubled. I would have liked to see more resolution for her. As it was, it felt sort of incomplete. My takeaway is that everyone lives in their own distorted version of reality and when the truth shows up it can have devastating repurcussions. So, don’t lie and don ‘t cheat.For the rating:Genre and general reading age – it’s a mystery and thriller. Reading age is adult, due to some really difficult scenes and references, including excessive drinking by more than one of the characters. Sometimes I wondered how they were able to stand up.The level of sexuality – for the amount of cheating involved, it was surprisingly mild. There weren’t actual sex scenes, but memories of trysts and a morning after.Was there graphic language? Not much.Did I cry? Nope.Is it part of a series? Nope.Level of character development was very high. Out of the three men and three women who make up the story, only one was a bit weak. The others were strong and I could see them in my mind.Did I laugh? Nope.This was a fantastically-written story and once I picked it up I couldn’t put it down, literally. I stayed up late into the night with this one. I’m happy to give it <U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F>.5 stars. It was almost perfect."
"Interesting read, kept my attention through out and kept me guessing.  Felt back for Rachel - main character.  Disgusted by Anna.  Dismayed for Megan.  Can see what it got compared to Gone Girl the organization is similar (paragraphs from different characters perspective so you just see part of the story and have to put it together like a puzzle).  Enjoyed the book!"
"It was a perfect book for reading on the beach, which is what I did last month. The writing style made it a very easy read and kept me turning the page (well, not literally, I used Kindle). Hard to put down. You just want to race through to get more info as you try to figure out who was the murderer."
"I knew nothing about this book, I downloaded it a minute before take off so I'd have something to read on an East to West coast flight. It popped up as a recommend on Kindle. I was engaged by and liked a fairly unlikeable character at first glance. Paula Hawkins has a wonderful writing style. It felt authentic to each character's voice. And I was surprised once or twice."
"I enjoyed the style of writing. It was easy to read, the characters were well developed. They had to be so you could follow the story from chapter to chapter and flashbacks to present day. Those all made for an intriguing who done it."
A little slow in the beginning because I was confused about which girl was talking.  It soon became clear and then I enjoyed it. Story of 3 emotionally challenged women two of which achieved a balance in their lives but not without consequences.All three were never enviable to me just self destructive. Good mystery and page turner
I was hesitant to read this at first because I read a bad review but I'm so glad I changed my mind! This book sucked me in and took me for a great ride. I love the different perspectives and really didn't have it figured out until the very end.
"It's an interesting read, but the characters are all pretty unlikeable. Very similar to Gone Girl, but without any of the ""holy sh*t!"" moments. If you liked Gone Girl, skip it. If you didn't like Gone Girl, skip it."
"After all the hype, I was expecting more mystery and drama........sort of a nail-biter. But it's not that kind of book. It's more about what goes on in several character's heads, especially the main woman. It was just okay."
Disappointed by the lack of credible character and plot development.  Disjointed build up maintained my interest yet then became flat and improbable.  This is one book where I anticipate the movie will be better than the original.
"I was hoping for another Gone Girl, while the story wasn't awful I just hate that style of the set up , each chapter anothrr person, flipping back the dates.  A better story allows that style, but I was just annoyed thru most of the reading."
"It took me a long time to read this book, I must have picked it up and put it down a dozen times. But about 50 pages in, it's a real page-turner and hard to put down. A real whodunnit, the deception, lies, and betrayals just keep coming at you. Great plot and well developed, believable characters."
"If you like a thriller for flights, this is your book! it really catchy and will keep you pinned for hours."
Great novels have complex characters and narratives. I did not feelLike any of the characters in Girl on the Train were more than paper thin which made it  It was very difficult to care about or root for anyone  The novel had a great deal of hype and it did not deliver.
Well developed plot and didnt expect who the perpertrator turned out to be. At times it was a bit slow and seemed like going over old ground. Sometimes I wanted to shake the main character out of her neurosis. Overall a good read
"It took some time to understand the  abnormal thought processes of the characters involved in this ultimately gripping story. One should have some knowledge of abnormal psych.to fully grasp the motivations and interactions of these truly ""screwed-up"" people ...but,don't let any of what I said stop you from enjoying this book,I did!"
"Great plot twists and turns. I couldn't stop reading!  I was impressed with the storytelling of each person throughout the book; and, how it all came together in the end. I'm afraid to see the movie, because I'm sure the book is best!"
"When I first started reading this, it was hard for me to grasp the narratives.  Once I realized how it was being written, I got more in tuned with the story line.  About halfway to 3/4 of the way through the book, I then got anxious to see how it was going to end.  In talking with others who have read the book, my take away is they liked it more than I did."
I don't like it at all...going back and forth with chapters no fun...will see what book club group says...read first third and then the last pages...skipped the middle but got the gist of the story.
If you loved Gone Girl then this book is for you! Intriguing from the beginning and keeps you reading! Feels like a short book but it's not...that's great writing! Definitely a page turner.  Will be reading more from this author in the future!
"Really enjoyed this book...I hated to put it down and then couldn't wait to pick it back up. Stayed up till after midnight reading so I could find out who did it!!  Loved that you got the story from all 3 women involved...it was nice getting each of their perspectives & stories.  If you like suspense novels, then you'll like this book."
I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a juicy thriller in a woman's voice. The inner dialogues and situations they find themselves in feel authentic and frightening at the same time.  Great quick beach read! Already figuring who will play whom in the movie.
"Such a great read!  I am so glad I read the book before seeing the movie.  I have seen the comparisons to gone girl, and the only similarity I can discern is that of an enthralling read that will keep you guessing.  I LOVED IT!"
"I do not relate well to weak, helpless women who have no self confidence.  I slogged through this book because others raved about it. I found it depressing and I totally disliked every single character.  I stopped reading it two times and finally finished it.  I don't know why.....I would not recommend this book to anyone!"
"Definitely didn't meet my expectations. Was looking for a jaw dropping experience, like other reviews had conveyed. Ended up disappointed that my predictions were accurate. However, I did enjoy the way Hawkins gave the reader multiple POVs."
"I'm not a big reader but I recently won a kindle at work so I wanted to try a few e-books.  I chose this book because I thought the movie previews looked interesting.  I could not put this down, I ended up reading the entire book in 1 day!"
"This well-written, alternatiing character novel was slow to grab me, but I read on 'cause everyone I know seemed to love this book. I read on and was glad I had, but it gave me no great pleasure or intellectual take-away."
"Though it captured my attention from the beginning, it was not a good book. The characters lacked any kind of development and in the end were all deserving of each other's insanity.  Not a fan and don't understand the hype."
"Girl on the Train kept me entertained, and I quite enjoyed the twisty ending.  This isn't a story with credible, fleshed out characters, but that lends itself to the protagonist's alcohol-bruised, myopic view of the world.  Drunk with tunnel vision, irrational desires and failures of common sense, GOTT is one, lonely woman's suspenseful journey from her boozy black-outs to sobriety and sanity."
"I liked this book but didn't love it as much as I expected I would, probably due to all the hype. The author's writing was very strong and the characters were compelling, but I found the plot to be predictable. I figured it out long before the end and was surprised there wasn't a final twist. Still, it was generally a good mystery and I'll read more by the author."
"This book was very disappointing to me. The story line seemed so strong.It took forever for the story to take off. I was halfway through the book before the plot really began to develop. There were pages I skimmed through and still missed absolutely nothing.Despite the slow start, the last few chapters were good and provided an interesting twist in an otherwise boring book."
"Slow to start but you do get attached to the lead character and start to really pity her situation. It's a bit frustrating at times because you want to shake her and make her realize what's going on. Once I realized what was actually happening, I got a bit more intrigued by the book and couldn't wait to finish it. Ending was great!"
"It's difficult to say that I enjoyed the book, because the story, though quite intriguing, is also quite depressing.  I gave the 4 star rating because the book was written in a manner that was easy to follow, easy to read.  I was pulling for the main.character.  Once the story was in the final.chapters I.found it difficult.to.put down.  If you enjoy a good mystery, you will love this book."
I couldn't put this book down. Kept me on the edge of my seat thru every page! Looking forward to the movie.
The book could have been better paced. But it is undeniably a very good thriller. I think it could have been shorter and the suspense would have still been the same.
"I read this book in 3 days. Like riding on a train, with few stops in between.It was an amazing story."
"Three narrators, three points of view...where does the truth lie? In this riveting novel, the reader journeys along with Rachel as she struggles to make sense of her alcohol-fogged memories after the disappearance of Megan, who lives down tge street from Rachel' s former husband and his new wife Anna. Loved it, couldn't put it down. Still deciding whose was tthe most chilling voice. Highly recommend."
"Easy, exciting, read. Movie coming out soon wanted to read the book first. I really enjoyed it. Believable characters and plot line."
"The author must be a fascinating person to have come up with the story, envisioned all the different characters and then to have written it in their own voices. For me it was hard to follow at the beginning because I was reading it sporadically but once I began to read it more intensely I found myself being drawn in until the unexpected ending."
With all the hype about the movie I thought I would read the book first. It was a good read. Not fantastic but kept my interest. The book isn't very long and the character development is Okay. Drags on a bit about the alcohol abuse.
What a great read this turned out to be! I'm a HUGE fan of Gone Girl and this rivals it on my top 10 list. Very interesting and fast paced.
Keeps you guessing until the very end! Should be a great movie. Quick read with an intriguing and twisty plot
"Great read, well written, twisted plot. Characters are awful people and I was so frustrated by their bad behavior. But there was something about poor Rachel that I liked, she is pathetic but not hopeless. I loved the story and how you hear from each woman's side of things. We can all be those normal women who do something awful to the men we love and for the men we love. Alcoholism is disgusting."
"Fantastic debut.Paula Hawkins nailed the alcoholic narrator, and the story wound to a satisfying twist. Even once the reader discovers the ""whodunit"" of the book, the characters continue to surprise.I also enjoyed the voices of the three main characters, all of whom felt unique. Very well written story. I would tell anyone looking for a suspenseful thriller to read this book."
"I enjoyed the book but was very confused in the beginning due to the trying to keep the characters straight.  The main character rode the train daily but she had named the people that she saw and as the story progressed you learn the real names of the characters and it was just hard for me to keep up as I read in spurts.  The story was good with it's twists and turns and it took me awhile to figure out the villian, but I would recommend the book however I would recommend that you try to read it straight through and not in the spurts as I did as I did have the characters confused for a while."
"Great book, I wasn't sure what was going to happen until the end!  It takes place in modern times, so it should be girl on the tube, or metro or subway.  Rachel is a drunk and screw up, imagining the lives of other people she sees from her seat on the train.  She pushes herself to become part of the lives of the people she sees and, well it's a mystery so I don't want to say more!  If you've been to a therapist you'll recognize what your therapist tells you when you've behaved badly.  Anyhow, super book, I'm sure it'll  be a movie."
"A very good mystery.  It was a good story, even without the ""guessing who did it"" part.  3 Women tell their story, and each has a compelling story.  But for this novice, the murderer was not obvious until near the end."
"I enjoyed this book. Intense and suspenseful I was hooked from the beginning. movie based on the book coming out soon and I would recommend the book first, since the movie rarely lives up to the book."
"This novel was slow-going at first. The characters were all flawed. However, the story soon turned into a ""page turner"" and I was determined to reach the end as soon as possible. Who hasn't peered into the windows of strangers and imagined what their lives might be like? I enjoyed the book very much. I did not give it 5 stars because of the ""slow"" start and the fact that there really weren't any heroes/heroines in this tale."
"This is the kind of book where you want to reach into the pages and wring the protagonist's neck!  I shouted at her; I ranted; I raved, but she didn't listen.  She just continued on her path of self-destruction and dragged me along for the ride.  Plenty of twists and turns, just like the train ride, and just want you think you know what's going to happen next ... the plot changes!  Reads quickly and is spell-binding."
"I thought this was a great book - it was a fast read, it was full of surprises and plot twists, and was well written.  I'm looking forward to the movie that will be coming out in the near future as well.  I found this to be a great vacation book, and finished it within just a few days while relaxing on the beach."
I enjoyed the writing style in which the narrative is alternatively voiced by each of the main characters.  It held my attention...even the second time through.  Am now looking forward to the screenplay!
Flawed characters with all sorts of intertwining complications  set in a London suburb. The main character is pitiable at times but shows remarkable steadfastness in solving a personal mystery. Some really clever unexpected twists made this book the center of my attention for awhile. Recommended for anyone who loves a good mystery which has just enough characters to keep it interesting without the need to keep track of obscure characters that pop in and out of the plot line sporadically. Great read!
"There is a reason this book was on the top sellers list for more than a year.  At first start, I thought this person was a drunk and couldn't see any thing good happening to her.  Then the story is developed and I could not put it down until I finished.  Wonderful book, great writing."
"Took me 2 trys to finish the book. Had a hard time getting into it.  Once in, I liked it.  You just have to pay close attention to which character each chapter is about or its easy to get the characters confused.  Keeps you in suspense about ""who done it"" until the end.  The author throws suspicion on several characters."
"This is like a Gillian Flynn ""Dark Places"" kind of book. The characters in the book have no redeeming qualities. From the drunk, lying stalker main character to the cheating, manipulating ex-husband, there was no one in the book to root for or identify with - I couldn't put the book down!  Give this book a try-you won't be disappointed."
"I thought this was an excellent read!  It's written from several characters points of view, which in the Kindle version are a little faded and hard to read so I was a little confused the first few chapters.  But the story kept me going and by halfway through I couldn't put it down because I was anxious to see how it would pan out."
Great book! I love that the author made me care about all of the characters! It was well written. I absolutely wanted to read this book in one sitting! Looking forward to seeing the movie but I'm sure it won't be as good!
"Enjoyable, there are some very interesting twists, characters are well written and interesting. I have to say from the movie trailer, the book, ( not sure how the movie will go) was not at all what I expected. That was a very pleasant surprise."
"I don't like to read stories about sad, lonely, pathetic people such as myself, but a friend recommended this book. It is a real gripper. The characters were easy to follow as the style flows. Why do people have to make things so difficult? Life shouldn't be this tough, but it's our darn big brains, making mountains out of molehills and such."
If I'd have watched it as a movie I wouldn't feel so bad about wasting my time reading it and it would have been the same.  The characters did not have much depth to them.  No surprises in this book one knew who the killer was from the beginning.
I expected a fascinating story. Unfortunately this book did not deliver. It was very easy to discern the actual murderer which took most of the fun out of it. In addition each character was such an unpleasant person it was very difficult to care about any of them. I would not recommend to anyone.
This book is very intriguing.  I found it hard to put down.  Since I was reading it on Kindle it was hard to keep track of the dates of the various chapters.  And this was critical to know the sequence of the plot.  Nevertheless I wanted to keep reading to find out who the murderer was. Or was there even a murder committed?  Lots of mystery!
"A little twisted... the book won't probably appeal to those looking for a satisfying ending. It held my interest, the story hung together, the characters and their actions were true to themselves throughout the whole book, but I'm still not sure if I liked it. Four stars because it was well written, not because it made me happy."
It was hard to like any of the characters. I was hoping I would  finish the book quickly and I didn't care how it ended.There wasn't one character that I cared about.
"I liked this book. The word pictures and descriptions were very good, and you could almost see everything as you read along. I had a little difficulty with Rachel. She seemed incredibly stupid in the risks she took,but maybe there are people who would act as she did. The book kept me guessing, and it was hard to put down.who would act as she did."
Incredible story....Loved it!  Three people have voices throughout the story that keep you captivated and on the edge of your seat.  Rachel's voice was different ... like she was saying what she felt and it was unfiltered and scattered.....like she was the train wreck!  Began the story thinking one thing and was surprised by the twists that got me from the beginning to the end.  Loved it!
"The Girl on the Train was a suspenseful thriller similar to Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl.  Rachel rides a train everyday and is able to see a young couple through the Windows of their home during the trains stop every morning and every evening.  When the young woman of the couple goes missing,  Rachel finds herself implicated in her disappearance.  This is a must read for those who like a good whodunit."
"Started good, hard to follow at times, got slow in the middle,but more exciting towards the end.  I expected it to be a lot more attention getting but it wasn't for me.  Interested in seeing the movie now out of curiosity."
This book was hard to put down once I got fully into it. I like how the author kept me on the edge as if I was watching a movie. I dint like the ending too much but it was consistent with the story. I'm looking forward to seeing the movie!
"I thought the book was well written, but it was hard for me to like the extremely unreliable narrator, since part of the plot was that she was an alcoholic and blacked out several times and couldn't remember what happened during the night of a murder.  I also found her motivation to insert herself into the situation very unlikely.  I thought it was ok."
Fabulous book
"I haven't read a book like this in a while, but once I started I couldn't put it down.  The whole set up of the book keeps you very intrigued and constantly guessing.  I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great read!"
"i liked the book. glimpse to the moods and every day struggle of alcohol addicted girl whom u can understand and symphatise with.  vivid picture of gray days and moving trains stayed with me long after i finish the book. the plot is good, the last part when everything is clear is a bit long, but all by all a very good aftertaste."
"It takes a sensitive writer to lead the reader around the kinds of complications that make modern life so complicated. In this tale, it is important to construct a picture of each woman from the elements presented, with attention to the date of the entry, to be able to have it together by the end. The female characters are individual and unique, yet have a lot in common. The male characters present as somewhat flawed but multifaceted and hard to discount. The intensity of the plot increases along the way, making it harder and harder to put the book down even for a moment."
Rachel a divorced woman that rides the train daily gets wrapped up in mysterious missing girl mystery. Rachel watches a loving couple from the train window twice a day until one day she witnesses another man with her. Shortly after seeing this the girl goes missing. Rachel gets involved trying to help the girl's husband. Rachel has  a history in the neighborhood and a drinking problem that makes her story questionable.This story has many twists that keep the story interesting and unpredictable. I got hooked and it was hard to stop reading.
"Sometimes I just want to read a good mystery....However, I have a low tolerance for swearing, graphic sex and over-explicit violence. Which means that many very popular books are ones that I would not enjoy.I enjoyed this book!  In a couldn't-put-it-down way. Read the book rather quickly, while paying attention to the details. Writing was excellent.It is worth your time."
The story moves very quickly and has great twists to the story. So many details and the back and forth of the characters' stories kept me very interested. Enjoyed this very much and will recommend to others.
"this was a really good book. I was looking for something as a back up while on vacation and when I found this book at the airport, it ended up being the book I was going to read. this book caught and kept Mt attention so much so that I was able to read it in 5 days which is my personal best. I found myself trying to guess who the murder was and I did predict it, but it wasn't until the end and it still surprised me."
"I had made up my mind that this would be like the movie Rear Window but it was very different. Several characters get developed into suggested suspects and you just never know. What kept this from 5 stars for me is that, and maybe I'm naive, I couldn't really believe that many people in close proximity had so many issues. So, although they were hard to believe for me, that many issues made for a truly intriguing story."
"Paula Hawkins has constructed a well – written, well-organized story that is told through three different first person narrators. This strategy of story telling – first Rachel, now Megan, now Anna, now Rachel, with soliloquy’s by Megan told after her disappearance, constantly reminds us that we cannot trust anyone. Memory and imagination can be manipulated, and people and events are open to interpretation. The Girl on the Train is a lesson in character study, and executed brilliantly at that...Read more at http://ilovemymani.com/2015/03/06/tan-lime-the-girl-on-the-train-book-review/"
"This book's main character is an alcoholic.  Like her roommate Cathy, I wanted to shake her and tell her to straighten up.  Seeing the world through her eyes, it was hard to know what to believe, and as the murder unfolds, I didn't care much for the victim or her bereaved spouse,neither.  I was thoroughly engrossed until 1/2 through, then cause I didn't really feel invested in any of the main characters, I was just ready to finish the book and figure out the mystery."
"It took me a long time to read this book, I must have picked it up and put it down a dozen times. But about 50 pages in, it's a real page-turner and hard to put down. A real whodunnit, the deception, lies, and betrayals just keep coming at you. Great plot and well developed, believable characters."
"This book is so engrossing in a way that is hard to describe.  The writer has an eerie insight into the workings of an alcoholic mind.  Describes the thinking and actions of a level 10 Narcissist in a way that makes you say, 'yes, that's it exactly'.  The ending brings you from pitying the heroine to cheering her.  A great read."
"The book is very well written and entertaining; I would've given the book 5 stars but the very end is a bit unbelievable.  Would I recommend this book?  Absolutely!  However, I hope the movie ending is more realistic."
"This is an absorbing mystery with some interesting twists, and I definitely recommend it.  However, I only give this 4 stars because while the main character is well developed, I would have liked to know a little more about the original motivations of the other two women in the book.  There is also no explanation for why the killer has become a sociopath.  Perhaps its not important to understand the killer, but I wanted this information. Still all in all, it is a very good read."
"It was a good ""who done it"" but lacked character development. The lead character's self-pity party was a bit hard to follow through the whole book, but overall I think the author raised a few interesting points about the complexity of relationships. It was also interesting to follow the outcome of a seemingly small event that was witnessed by one individual through the repercussions it had on several lives."
"I almost gave up on this book several times.  Especially on the Kindle, it was hard to keep up with which character was speaking.  There were many twists and turns, too many for me.  The content was a combination of introspective thoughts and conversations;  for me always having to check who was speaking.  It might have been better (for me) if I had purchased the paper version.  I read at night, often not for long, depending on what I'm reading! This was just not my kind of book!"
"Despite its popularity, I found this book distinctly unpleasant and unenlightening.  Though it was reasonably well written, I thought the technique of alternating chapters from different time periods didn't have much purpose, except perhaps to build some tension that would not otherwise have been there had the events been in chronological order.  The women in the book were shallow, foolish,  and dependent, the men's characters only sketchily drawn.  I thought the book worked as a mystery, but not in other ways, and the characters had few, if any, redeeming characteristics."
"Filled with lots of twists and turns, this mystery thriller is a real goodie!  It starts slowly, gathering momentum as each chapter passes, until the exciting conclusion comes at you like an oncoming train.  Once I got into the meat of it, all household tasks were put aside until I finished.  Yes, I can see the comparisons to Gone Girl.  If you like the one, you will undoubtedly enjoy the other."
"I would recommend this book. It started slow and since I didn't read a synopsis of it before starting, had no idea where it was going. However, about a third of the way through. I couldn't put it down.  All of the pieces of the mystery start to fall into place faster and faster. It's fun to have the different perspectives of the three main women. Nobody is completely innocent."
"While I am not a huge fan of fiction, this book, The Girl on the Train, was a superb character study encased within a murder mystery.  The author, Paula Hawkins, draws the reader into the story with paintbrush strokes into the work of the protagonist in all her misery and addiction. It got to a point where I couldn't put the book down because I had to know more and more about Rachel's universe, Megan's unbalanced mind and Anna's symbiotic personality.  Well done!!"
The Author kept you thinking it's was Scott and then No  it was Tom...or the Red Haired man.??It was also interesting how she wrote it so you knew what each woman who was experiencing!!Great read!!
"I love an unreliable narrator done well. Rachel even knows she's unreliable--she's an alcoholic who experiences blackouts. People tell her some of what she's missed, and she retains feelings and impressions; but are either real? For that matter, how reliable are the other narrators? The sort of mystery that kept me guessing till the end."
"I thought this was an utter page-turner!  The writer builds the suspense through the main character, a rather pathetic alcoholic who can't seem to get herself out of a downward spiral or make coherent life/friend/ex-husband decisions.  Thus, no one believes her when she suspects she's knows something about a murder, but can't fully pull up the memory.  Then again, perhaps no one is as they seem.  Great book."
"I found this to be over rated! This book took me a long time to finish. I couldn't get into it and it didn't deliver. The reviews made me keep reading it. I was waiting on the good part. Sadly, it did not show up."
"I really liked this book, so much so that I leant it to my coworker who also really loved the book and got her started on audio books to listen to while commuting to and from work.  This one kept my interest and I think is in the works to being made into a film. Recommend this one."
"I enjoyed this book. Touted as a thriller, its a bit too slow. You have to take care of watching the dates on the chapters since there are occasional flashbacks, and the time line is not just moving forward. Some of the mental musings get a bit long in the tooth, but you'll know them pretty quick and you can speed read through them. Some of the usual situations that make you think some people are just incredibly stupid."
"After all the hype that I had been reading about this book,  I honestly expected to be more interested in finding out for myself what it was all about. I have it be honest. In my opinion it was simply boring. I found it very difficult to even become interested in it from the very beginning. Maybe it's just me, but the twists & turns of it all weren't exactly earth shattering. Quite predictable actually."
"I wasn't enthralled by this book and I wanted to be. I had a really difficult time getting into it. There were details that kept coming up that weren't even needed for the storyline. At first, I couldn't put my finger on why this book bothered me. Then it hit me....every single female character was weak and I just couldn't like them.I think this book had potential, but just wasn't developed that well.That said, however, the twists and turns of the story were very riveting. I certainly could not have predicted the end."
A real page turner. Reads fast. Very entertaining. Each chapter the point of view of a difference  character. Hawkin hits a home run with a first time novel. Be interesting to see what she comes up with next.
"I am not into reading all that much, but this book is so suspenseful! I could not put it down. Girl on the Train is very well written and keeps the reader on the edge. I have three kids under 14 and I was able to put this book away in 3 days. I loved it! I hope this author writes more books like this."
I have to say I was a bit disappointed with this book. Not sure what all the excitement was about regarding this book. It was not a favorite. I found it had a predictable storyline (and ending). Not a fan of flashback or diary style of writing and that might be part of the problem I had with the book. It is written in the same style as Gillian Flynn (and I didn't like her books either). I have friends who loved this book and some that felt the same as I did. YMMV.
"This book was very riveting!!  I read it in about a day and a half.  Kept me turning the pages, and that's something because I haven't picked up a book in 2 years that I hadn't stopped reading in the middle."
"Absorbing story with that ""I must find out what happened"" feeling about it. A little confusing as it is told in the first person by 3 different women. But worth the effort. Will make a great movie."
"When I first started to read this book, Girl on the Train, I was somewhat bored, so I put it down and did not return to reading it for several months. A friend encouraged me to stick with it, so I started to read it again. I didn't want to put it down; there were so many twists and turns. It was a little hard to get into, but once you did it was a very good ! I would definitely recommend it to people who like  mysteries."
"With the purchase, the time invested to read it and all the thousands of stars from all the reviewers! This book left me thinking, some scenes haunted me. It kept me guessing and took me by surprise. The writing is vibrant and sharp, the characters flawed and captivating. No need to write a long review as there are so many who have done a great job describing The Girl On The Train before me. I will simply say it is a rare gem and I hope Ms. Hawkens has many more planned."
"I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes a twisted mystery!  The women in this story are all flawed but Ms. Hawkins makes them likeable and you end up rooting for them in end.  There is Rachel. The broken woman whose husband has left her for his mistress.  Now they have a perfect life (maybe) and Rachel is riding a train back and fourth to London so she doesn't have to tell her flatmate she was fired from her job for being drunk! Anna is the mistress turned perfect wife and mother but as the saying goes ""if they'll do it with you,they will do it to you""  Lastly there is Meghan the married woman who is hiding dark secrets and having affairs of her own.  This story is told by these three flawed and human woman and the ending is not what anyone expects!"
"The beginning of the story drove me somewhat crazy, too.  The choices of the main character, while in alcoholic stupors, were one ridiculous thing after another.  But the series of choices and a woman's disappearance made me keep turning the pages.  Stick with it.  It gets better, and ends up being a satisfying mystery novel."
"I generally adore books of this nature. Conflict between husband and wife is a fun read for me.  We have drunken Rachel, whose self esteem is battered. Hard to route for her but it says something about the author to get the reader involved enough to be frustrated with a character. The book was an easy read and made me look forward to finishing it. Would not have guessed the ending and who had dealt the sad end to adulterer Megan. Nevertheless I felt dissatisfied with the ending and felt it should have had a somewhat stronger conclusion."
"This is not a great novel. It meanders quite a bit and moved backward and forward in time, using multiple female first person voices that are sometimes hard to distinguish. But, it will hold your interest. They main character (Rachel) is flawed, and over time, while reading the book, you will find all five of the main characters very flawed in multiple ways.  In fact, after learning her history and what drove her to become a drunk, Rachel comes out as a bouquet of roses compared to the other two women (and obviously the other 2 men) in the story. It absolutely is nothing like Gone Girl, and nothing like a good Hitchcock piece, but it certainly is not as bad as some people are saying."
"Fast-paced, confusing at first until all the pieces start coming together, then thrilling and finally chilling! It was hard to stop reading. I flew through the pages barely reading each word. I didn't want it to end but was anxious to know how it ended! I enjoyed reading about the same days from the first person narratives of three women, although at first I felt the need to page back to check dates as each woman reported events from her own perspective. Don't do that. It will come together on its own and the dates will inevitably make sense.  I can't wait to see the movie!!"
"Rachel is an alcoholic who has blackouts.  She spends her day riding a train, fantasizing about people she sees during her commute.  She has lost everything, her husband, her job, her home and this final blackout almost costs her her life.  This is a story of damaged, self absorbed people and the mystery that ties them together."
"The first time I started reading I set aside after just a few pages. Several months and many novels later I gave it another try. Finished in one day. The outcome is predictable but you are not certain your anticipation is on point until the end.  That the mystery can be ""solved"" is itself a sad reminder of the prevalence of these circumstances."
"Based on the reviews, I thought this book would be excellent. However, I barely made it through 10% of it when I began to become bored, and I began asking myself, ""Why did I ever order this book?"". It wasn't at all fast paced, as I like, but rather slow in developing, and it was also set in England, which I usually don't care for anyway. Finally after reading 15% of it, I stopped. Compared to Grisham, Sheldon, Brennan, and Sanford, who are my favorite suspense authors, it was a ""bummer"""
"I was enthralled by Hawkins' uncanny ability to describe the demons with which alcoholics live. The vast majority of the human race doesn't understand the illness that keeps an alcoholic from sobriety, nor fully comprehend the depth of an alcoholic blackout. The ""Who done it""aspect of the story took a back seat to Rachael's inability to leave the bottle alone. Well done, Hawkins."
"I really loved how the narrator changed throughout the book, it took me awhile to really get into the story but once I did it was the kind of book you can't wait to get home and pick up again.  The author did a great job NOT doing a lot of foreshadowing so the ending came as somewhat of a surprise and that made it more fun to make my own predictions along the way.Don't expect this to read as well as a Gillian Flynn thriller, it took awhile for the story to really get rolling.  Definitely a good read, but compared to other books I've read in the same genre recently I gave it 4 stars."
"Page turner from start to finish.  Couldn't put it down, I needed to know what she knew and how she was going to figure it out.  I will never ride on a train without remembering how she felt, what she saw and how she coped.  Must read for anyone who has been in love!"
Great murder mystery written in the first person through the eyes of multiple characters. A little confusing at the beginning as perspectives and dates are not in chronological order so reader must pay attention to who's talking and the time sequence in which stories are being recounted. All in all a very exciting novel. Kept me up late reading it....couldn't put it down.
"It was a perfect book for reading on the beach, which is what I did last month. The writing style made it a very easy read and kept me turning the page (well, not literally, I used Kindle). Hard to put down. You just want to race through to get more info as you try to figure out who was the murderer."
"Not sure how this got multiple book of the year awards, but I guess it depends on the reader. That's why I got the book, so I had high expectations. But if I wouldn't had known that, it would've been much better. Good book regardless."
"This book is well written and beautifully plotted. As a writer myself, I am a fierce critic. Not once did I doubt the characters. Not once did any of their voices falter. Not once did the author slip or fumble my suspension of disbelief.The most brilliant plot mechanism is the use of two timelines. You know they are going to meet, the question is how.  I also love poor, flawed Rachel."
"Not a bad book. It definitely isn't on my list of favorites. I hate when I figure out the ending half way thru. Writing is decent but the story wasn't as clever as it could of been and there were absolutely no redeeming qualities of any of the characters. Nevertheless, quick read, and I guess, it's good to say you read it."
"In some ways I feel like I'm stretching it for four stars.  But I enjoyed the writing and I enjoyed the novel written from the perspectives of three women.  What disappointed me was it wasn't as gripping as I expected from other reviews, and I certainly wouldn't have labeled it a psychological thriller.  Sometimes the characters seem dense or stupid beyond words, but the author does well at luring you in to caring for them.  Worth the read primarily because everyone is reading it and it can be engaging.  But this wasn't one of those books I was sorry to see end."
"This broken ""girl"" absorbs herself in the life of a couple she sees from the window of the train she rides each day.  She builds a fantasy name, personality, and life for them only to discover reality when the woman is found dead.  Pushing her way into the mystery of the murder, she discovers the downfall that brought her to her alcoholic stupor, losses and guilt.  Full of twists and turns you will not expect."
So disappointed in this one.  The back and forth chapters would have been a great idea if the writer had been able to distinguish the characters with more depth. Both the main female and male characters were so similar that it was hard telling them apart. The writing was only mediocre.  Also saw the reveal way before the end. Plus the backstory for one of the characters was just silly.  It was very popular.....a lot if people loved it. Not me.
"I though this was OK but not up to all the hype the book's received. It's not another Gone Girl, to which it's often compared and which I believe had more twists and better developed characters. But the concept was fascinating, as anyone who's ever looked out a train window and wondered about the lives of people living in houses near the tracks can appreciate. But I guessed the ""surprise"" about midway through, and I felt the story did drag in places. Nonetheless, it's a good beach read for this summer!"
"I give this book three stars because the author used a unique way of telling her story.  Each character, alternately, laid out the plot from his/her point of view. It took a while to get used to that, as I felt the story moved too slowly most of the time; however, eventually it proved helpful in solving the ending before it was fully revealed.  Overall, the book was a bit dark and depressing, filled with characters who seemed enslaved by their circumstances...and without much hope."
"This was difficult to follow.  It must be the latest rage to write this way.  I had difficulty getting started and because I personally don't pay attention to chapter headings it took me a while to realize that I had better pay attention.  Having been married to a person similar to Tom, I figured it could be him early on.  It was still a good mystery.  It is amazing how a person like Tom could make others feel responsible and guilty.  Unfortunately, I lived in that kind of relationship for years.  Fortunately, I didn't turn to alcohol or who knows how it would have turned out."
A little slow in the beginning but then.........it is fabulous! I really couldn't put this book down. It goes back and forth.  I refuse to tell you anything as I might give the story away.  READ  IT !!!!
"It was very interesting to hear about the daily struggles of an alcoholic and the temptation to drink all the time, along with the shame and embarrassment she felt losing her job and behaving badly. A good read."
I expected a fascinating story. Unfortunately this book did not deliver. It was very easy to discern the actual murderer which took most of the fun out of it. In addition each character was such an unpleasant person it was very difficult to care about any of them. I would not recommend to anyone.
I didn't want to put the book down. I can usually predict the plot twist and the events in this story evolved nicely in way that kept me thinking and wanting to read more.  The characters were ok. I wish there was more to each character. I'm glad I read it before hearing more about the movie.
"For me, this is a new genre of mystery/thrillers, along the lines of Gone Girl. I like it. The characters are well developed, although I never did really understand what Megan's problem was. Was she bipolar? Narcissistic? In any case Rachel certainly was a tragedy, but in the end she redeemed herself, which I applaud. Like a train, this book chugged steadily along gathering speed at times and screeching to a stop at others. I couldn't put it down. There was just too much to discover and the desire to find out what happens next, undeniable."
"After reading many suspense novels by Daniel Silva, David Baldacci, and James Anderson I found this one to be a real gem.  Being written by a woman, I think, made it more interesting.  And, I think I gained some insight into women in general by reading it, and comparing it to the male's novels.  The males then to be very descriptive of settings.  Not so much Ms. Hawkins.  Her focus is mostly on feelings.  And, I found it refreshing, and highly entertaining.  I highly recommend this one."
"Bottom line - it's a murder mystery.  I enjoyed the book but it wasn't exactly 'stretching'.  Not really good material for a book club, but great for a beach read or a long plane journey.  I'd recommend it for that!  The story is told from differeing perspectives of the characters and personally I find that difficult on a Kindle as I can't flick back and forth to work out who is speaking and how it relates to what was said by someone else.  But that is a purely personal observation and doesn't detract from the book."
"I liked it that Ms. Hawkins was able to pace the novel in the same way that the Train in the title moved - starting fast, slowing down along the way, but then picking up speed.  The middle of the novel was incredibly slow for me, but it accelerated in the end.  I also understand why all the main women characters were somewhat similar and all the main men characters were similar - kept us guessing who the killer was, but I kept getting them mixed up, especially since the points of view changed with each chapter."
"This book was not at all what I expected. It has many twists and turns but is a wicked read. If you want something light, this isn't the book. Dark and somewhat disturbing but I am glad I made the purchase."
"Another contemporary feminist fiction novel full of unsympathetic characters careening through the plot.  Unless that is what you want to read, avoid this book."
"If you liked Gone Girl, then you will like The Girl on the Train.  The author exposes an intricate, well -written plot.  The main character is alcoholic and verging on the psychotic, but as the story unfolds, you realize there are others in the story as intensely obsessed as the main one.  Their various lives are intertwined in an intensely moving story that keeps you reading.  My main problem is not finding any sane people in this book."
"I was really looking forward to reading this book since it had gotten so many high ratings. I'm sad to say I was somewhat disappointed. Without giving away to much of the story, I will just say be prepared to read the first half without much happening. It does become suspenseful the last quarter but for me that was too long . comparing it to Gone Girl or Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, both given four and a half or five stars, this does not measure up ."
"I liked the fast pace of the story and how each character was full of flaws but still likable enough. It became somewhat predictable half way through on who the bad guy was, but I give props for imagining a good story out of the premise of a girl daydreaming and mind-stalking a couple. I felt the author was rather harsh in her description of Rachel, but maybe she drew the experience of someone she knew who was an alcoholic. Overall, pretty good, easy, fun read!"
"This book was slow to start, but once you realize that Rachel was not going to let anything alone, you're hooked!  So many twists and turns in this story and when its done, you'll be surprised at the eding."
"Another good quick and dirty read if you're traveling. I finished this book in no time flat. It kept me interested enough to not put down during my flight overseas. This is definitely the type of book I gravitate towards when I'm looking for an easy to digest read that I would liken to Gone Girl, but I will say the pace was a little better than that."
Confusing at first but eventually gripping.  Ultimately one of the best portrayals of a sociopath hiding in plain site I've ever read.
"It's every bit as good as 'Gone Girl', or even better. Kept me up for two nights to finish it."
"When I first started to read it I was very confused by the different names in the different chapters. I quit reading it. Then I picked it up again and couldn't stop reading. This book is much better than Gone GirlI did get a tiny clue near the end of the book and figured out who it was, but I would recommend reading it."
This. Book. Was. Great. It's a cliffhanger and you won't be able to put it down. The author writes very well and with the perfect amount evasiveness and descriptiveness so that you won't know what hit you till you're reading it. Definitely recommend!
This was an interesting read. I had most of it figured out halfway through . Still completely gives you a real time look at how alcoholism effects you. It just is kind of desperate and very far fetched. Enjoyed the writing style though.
"I have to admit: the premise of this story drew me in. Especially with everyone's constant comparison to Gillian Flynn. But oh man, I finished the book thinking, ""this feels like an awful episode of Law and Order: Special Victims Unit."" The characters were not just unlikable, but also unbelievable. Rachel, the main character of the story, seems like a crazy nut-job that absolutely NO public official would ever believe. She's constantly ""black-out drunk"" and consistently making bad decisions. There's just no way that someone could be THAT much of an idiot. I agree with another viewer also in saying that the voices of the women in the novel are at times interchangeable and the point of view switches so often that there were a few times when I went back to see who's portion I was reading.All of the ""cold-blooded killer"" suspects in this story seem like something a horny housewife came up. Scott, Tom, and Kamal are all apparently ridiculously good looking and psychotically crazy. Each of their dialogue is as corny as can be. Towards the end of the book I just couldn't help thinking, ""I would be cracking up if a supposed 'killer' was talking this way to me.""Overall, I would say that the book definitely drew me in. I read it in approximately 3 days. Was it worth it if you're looking for a quality piece of murder mystery nonfiction? No. Was it worth if you're looking for a trashy beach read? Likely."
Suspense that never let's up and keeps you turning the pages.
"Keep me reading, great twist, hard to put down. At some spots, it was difficult to remember which I was character I was reading about. She paints good pictures for the reader. Will definitely check out her other works."
"I created various scenarios for what had happened based on each character's actions and personalities. They evolved as I read until they were eventually proved wrong/right, and then it hits you, just before she knows it too."
"An unusual concept without any admirable characters, but still a page turning who dunnit."
Overall an engaging novel with solid character development. It was a little predictable at times but that didn't stop me from enjoying the story.  Quick read and can be enjoyed over a weekend. Recommend for anyone looking for a good story with mystery and intrigue.
"Loved it. Great thriller, didn't figure it out till close to the end. Not predictable like most books. My coworker read it too and we laughed because in the novel the main character is supposed to be fat but in the movie Emily Blunt is more famished looking. Typical Hollywood."
An amazing twisting and turning plot that leaves the reader guessing....and holding one's breath....until the conclusion. We have all imagined what goes on behind doors we pass on our daily commute.....never realizing the dangers that may lurk behind those doors.  Author Paula Hawkins brilliantly weaves her story and characters to a heart-stopping climax. A truly great read and highly recommended.
Keeps you guessing. A little bit slow in some parts though.  Would recommend to a friend. Great Book overall though.
"Only finished reading because I paid for it. Very hard to follow, would not recommend."
"This book felt derivative, and did not hold my interest. Written in 3 different voices... none of them were particularly appealing characters and I found myself not caring at all about what happened to them."
"Twist follows turn in this complicated mystery. The story is told through the eyes of three women each of which have unstable lives. The first is Rachel, the ex-wife of Tom, next, Anna, the ""other woman"" who is now married to Tom. They have a baby, Evie. The third is Megan, married to Scott and who lives four houses down from Tom. Early in the novel, Megan goes missing, the story follows!"
As an avid reader I was rather surprised I cannot give the book 5 stars. All the hype around it. Movie coming out. Main character drove me crazy. Maybe that was the point? Do women really act that way? I just wanted to get it read & done.
"I bought this book because I had a very long air trip to survive, and I admit The Girl on the Train made that easier.  However, story taught me very little, the setting was not interesting for me, the characters frankly, hard to feel attached to.  I was actually relieved when it was over and I could get away from it.  BUT, it did occupy me for two days of boring travel."
"This book starts slow and confusing, but overall a great read.  It was so well written you could not put it down.  My only complaint was that the beginning failed to grab my attention because I could not figure out what the overall story was about.  It seemed as though it was a slow story about a troubled girls life on a train, but that was only part of it."
"Wanted to read this before the movie came out.  Was not disappointed.  The author keeps the plot moving forward and keeps the reader in suspense, though was beginning to see ""whodunit"" towards the end.  Good read."
"I really enjoyed this book, it was hard to put down! Lots of twists and turns that kept you guessing until the very end"
This book has a very slow start. I picked through the first twenty pages for a month before I actually sat down to read it. It was worth the second effort. It's a well written whodunnit and I should have been more persistent when I first started reading book.  Readers will find an enjoyable book with plot twists and turns to stimulate your imagination!
"There is a reason this book was on the top sellers list for more than a year.  At first start, I thought this person was a drunk and couldn't see any thing good happening to her.  Then the story is developed and I could not put it down until I finished.  Wonderful book, great writing."
This book was selected for my book club.  I really enjoyed the twists and turns in this book.  My friends and I had great discussion about the topics and characters.  I'm really looking forward to the release of the movie this fall.  I hope it does not disappoint!
"Really enjoyable read.....well organized, well written,  and clever enough to keep you reading and guessing.Finished it over a long weekend and was entertained the entire time. Didn't give it 5 stars because I had some suspicions as it moved along. However, nothing could stop me from finishing and finding out if I was right or wrong with my hypothesis....the sign of a good mystery. :)"
Each character was fully developed-which left me wondering who possibly could have done this horrible deed.  I started to think that a random stranger would be the pick for this crime that affected so many lives.  Very good read.
"An enjoyable book to read throughout. The chapters are short, making it easy to pick up and put down as often as you want, but the further on you go the more you want to know what happens next. A definite page turner."
"This was a quick and interesting read. I'm looking forward to seeing the movie adaptation. I enjoyed the different point of views, and concise writing style. I would recommend for anyone seeking a short dark thriller."
You will struggle to put this book down. The characters deliver a wonderful sense of 21st century realism where everyone has flaws and a motive. Paula Hawkins also demonstrates a real talent for romantic excitement and sexual tension.
"would have given this book 5 stars, but I really don't like when the narrator changes characters, but I wanted to give it a 4.75 because although the narrator changes characters, they are separated chapters.  But over all, the book was great.  Character development was perfect.  I could really imagine all the characters in my mind.  This is a must read book."
"I found the book to be well written, but at times annoying switching back and forth from the characters.  I didn't think it was as good as some of the reviews claimed.  I figured out who did what well into the book, but it really was painful at times to get to the main point.  I would recommend it as it is well written, but I did find it was just okay."
"I haven't been able to finish a book in years, but once I started reading I couldn't put it down."
"Really good book. Just when I thought i knew who was good and who was not, the real motives of the characters reveal themselves. The only reason i didn't give a 5 star is because I guessed who the antagonist was about half way through."
.It is not my kind of book.  With Kindle you could read something about the book  before you  ordered  the book.  That is not always the case now.  Where aare the free books that kindle  had?
"Don't read this book on your Kindle. You have to keep track of the dates & it's hard to do on the Kindle. I finally just wrote them down on a piece of paper to keep from getting so confused. Great book, a little confusing at first, but it will hold your interest & you will become one of the characters."
"KInd of written in the spirit of Gone Girl, and I'm not the first one to say it.Told from different perspectives, I have got to guarantee that you will not want to put this book down.You think you know what's going on....but you don't.You will quickly see why this book is a best seller, and book club selection.Go for it.  Thank me later."
"The Girl on the Train is obviously compared to Gone Girl probably because of the structure of the book and the fact that all of the characters are a little off. The book moves quickly and it's a fast read if you haven't anything to do for a weekend. Overall, I'd recommend it if you want a decent mystery and to see what all the hype is about."
"This might be the fastest I've ever read a book.  It held my interest and I loved how the chapters jumped between each of the three women. Rachel, the main character, is sad, sick, drunk, and just plain crazy most of the time. But, I liked her. The only reason for 4/5 stars is because the book ended too abruptly. I wanted more story after the dramatic end"
"I could not put the book down until I had finished it. The plot was amazing, a thriller to the very last page."
"The Girl on the Train is a thrilling book packed with mystery and intrigue. It gives readers insight into the minds of three separate women and how their lives and choices impact who they become, what they do, and how they survive all the while exploring the dangerous disappearance and death of one of them."
This book was beyond good. I loved every minute of it. I especially liked all the different perspectives and how the story is told. This book has been made into a movie and will be released October 2016. So excited!!
All I can say is read this book you won't be disappointed. Be prepared to read past your bed time and be completely obsessed with what happens next. I can't remember the last time I read a book that had me this enthusiastic and obsessed with what happens next.
"Generally I read male authors, but this is the second book by a female author that I have thoroughly enjoyed. The first being Gone Girl and now, The Girl on the Train. The authors depiction of the alcoholic Rachel was especially compelling. The story line was interesting and it grabbed your attention immediately and the writer let the tension build to the exciting climax. The character development of the three main female characters was very good and their different story lines made the story even more compelling. It's a hard book to put down."
"What a fantastic psychological thriller..I absolutely could not put this one down!! It's very refreshing to see a main character who is somewhat ""flawed""  like the rest of us, for example, alcoholic, overweight, suffering from depression, etc. The rest of the characters have their own demons and crosses to bear as well. The story line kept me enthralled, as the ""suspect"" seems to change minute to minute, keeping me guessing as to whodunit till the very end. ""Gone Girl"" (while still one of my favorite reads), has nothing on this page flipping, flawed character driven, thriller..."
"I wouldn't say this is a terrible read.  The storyline had some interesting parts to it, but I found it pretty predictable and repetitive.  You can only talk about the fact that the main character has completely let herself go, becoming an overweight, alcoholic, so much before you're tired of reading about it.Some describe this as the ""next Gone Girl"", but I highly disagree."
"Well done. Among other things, explores the theme of whether we can ever really know who another person is. I see a lot of Gaslight in this too, skillfully limned in the last chapters as Rachel comes into awareness of herself, what she witnessed the Saturday night when Megan disappeared, what Tom did to her, and finds the strength and resolve to discover the truth and trust herself."
"Wow!  I've read the glowing reviews, I know it's sold a bazillion copies, and it's probably only a matter of time before it's a Nicole Kidman movie.....but I don't get what's the big deal here.  For me, the novel only kicked into high gear during the last quarter. Up to then, though, it was very slow going.  If it hadn't  been for all those reviews, I'd have given up on it before I even reached that last quarter."
"This story immediately brought me back to my commuting days, boring house spent wondering about the people who lived along the train tracks. Hawkins takes that universal experience and spins it into a suspenseful tale that keeps the reader wondering and turning pages. It's a frighteningly apt portrait of life under the influence of alcohol, with jobs and relationships and facts slipping through the main character's fingers. I could not put this book down. Swift and crafty and insightful, it's a fine suspense novel. Small moments make big scary stories."
"I didn't really connect with the main character.  She's fat, drunk , and unattractive. She's just pathetic. I enjoyed how each chapter was written from each girl's point of view, but that's about it.  There's nothing shocking about the plot line. It's just kinda eh, meh, blah......"
"This is a fast but fun read.  My credulity at everyone's patience with Rachel's haunting of her old neighborhood was only slightly strained.  I guessed a good deal of the final reveal, but not all of it.  This is also not a book in which getting inside the head of the POV characters necessarily makes you like them a bit -- that was a good twist too.  All in all, a good page turner."
"I'm not sure where to begin.  Anything I write will not do justice to this VERY intriguing story.A daily commute on a train to satisfy a voyeurism habit of a lonely girl turns into a mystery, love story, heartache, thriller all rolled into one tightly written package.I've read it twice.  Yes, it's that good, and justly deserves a spot on the best sellers list."
It was an easy summer read. It was not the best mystery novel written...and the characters were a pretty one note. But I was looking for a quick summer read and this fit the bill. The writing was good and the plot kept me in it...I was fairly certain I knew who did it early on but nevertheless it was worth the read. I would give it 3 1/ 2 stars if I could.
Well written and liked the idea of telling the story from the perspective of 3 different characters in the story. There was something about the setting and the description of the street that evoked life in Britain for me even though it is 15 years since I left the UK.
"The book did not grab me in the beginning. In fact, I almost put it down to read a different book. But since i started it i decided to continue to see if it would pick up. It did. The book is worth a read and does have a few twists and turns. I figured it out before the end but would recommend it for a quick read."
"Probably a 3 1/2.  The characters all had problems, and they were not likable.  They seemed a variation of the same person.  The murder mystery was only mildly interesting.  I'm not sure why this book has been on the best-seller list for so long.  Other books on the list are much, much better."
It was a good mystery.  I had trouble at first because it was giving many individual points of view and I didn't get it at first.  It had a surprise ending.  I thought it was a little too drawn out on some of the characters but was good overall.
"I didn't dislike the book, but I was definitely able to put it down. For me, it lacked suspense. And it took me a long time to get the women's perspectives and timelines straight. Hoping the movie adaptation it better."
"The story was slow to get going and I found it confusing at first with the different narrators. Once the action picked up, it was more interesting. Definitely a dark tale, but somewhat instructional about the excessive use of alcohol."
Couldn't put it down. Kept me intrigued with lots of twists. Very well written especially by changing the author of different chapters.Got a different perspective of what was happening from each of the main characters.
"It was a page turner, I'll give it that and thus the two stars.  However, had I known it was so full of depressing characters, lying, drinking, cheating, murdering, I wouldn't have wasted my money.  There was not one character that you could really love.  It is suspenseful and you get hooked, but it ends leaving you feeling empty and relieved that it's over."
"Predictable, and not particularly interesting. Surprised it has lasted on the bestseller list for so long."
"I am surprised that I actually liked this book.  There is no redeeming hero or heroine, but the very flawed (all of them)  characters have a certain  appeal, and one cannot help feeling a sorrowful desire for at least one of them  to have something good in the end.  I guess it is appealing for the reader to get to feel a bit superior to those we are reading about.."
"Im not going to give a synopsis. Just going to say I couldn't put it down. Loved every minute of this messed up, crazy, make you cringe as you read book. I never read books a second time but even knowing how it ends I would read it again. Loved it!"
I loved this book!  I will not spoil it by giving a description of the book other than to say it is suspenseful!!  I bought it on my Kindle and read nearly straight through in one day because I could not put it down!!!  I loved the characters and I loved the way the book was written from the perspective of three characters.  I can't wait to see what this author writes next.
"It is the kind of book that's hard to put down.  It keeps you guessing until the very end.  Dark, sad, but triumphant at the end."
Wish I'd seen the film first. I wanted to slap the main character for most of the time.
Really liked the atmosphere and didn't expect the ending.  Very good reading. Even if I read a lot of these I really enjoyed the story. Don't understand the bad critics about the book as I read 10 in a row and 50 % of them disappointed me. Not this one.
"This story is a page-turner. Could not put it down.  It took me awhile to figure out how the book was written. It moves back and forth between the interwoven stories of 3 women.  Usually that would bother me because I like sequential stories, but it wasn't a problem.  For once I didn't get bored enough to read the ending before I was finished.  Great read!  Would make a great movie!"
"The book was good and very well written.  I thought it was a bit overhyped as a psychological thriller.  Characters were very well developed and there were several suspects interjected throughout the novel to keep one guessing as to who the real murderer was.  I didn't have it figured out until almost the end.  An enjoyable read but not the ""thriller"" I anticipated."
"Well written tragic thriller about how people delude themselves about the causes of the sadness and loneliness in their lives. Rachel, the main character, drinks a lot to combat her depression and isolation. Unemployed, she rides the trains, observing the activities of her ex-husband and the neighbors. What starts as curiosity mixed with drunken fantasy evolves into an investigation that eventually gets her back on the road to peace, health and sanity."
"This book had some clever twists, but the length of time it took to get to that point in the road was a bit much. There were points of monotony in the story of Rachel that were unnecessary, but overall a good read."
"I do have to say this book had quite a few twists. About half way through I could no longer put it down! We used it for a book club, which always makes me appreciate books more, and it led to a good discussion. All the characters are rather dark/depressed/twisted, so do not read this if you are looking for a feel-good book. I am thankful I was not able to relate to any of the characters, but I was still rooting for them. In the end there were a few good twists and it was nice that it wasn't too predictable. A good murder mystery."
"Disclaimer is that I haven't finished this book yet.  I started it on an airplane two nights ago and have been reading it every free moment I have.  It's well written, suspenseful and has good character development.  It has a bit of ""Gone Girl"" style plot, if you're into that genre of book."
"Although I enjoyed reading ""The Girl on the Train"" I did figure out the ending, but maybe I was supposed to. At least the suspense did not drag on and on. Interesting development of storyline through the perspective of the three women. I am grateful a friend told me to pay attention to which woman I was reading and the dates. Advise kept me from getting confused between them. All in all it was enjoyable, but did not live up to the hype."
"Don't let your mind wander while reading this book!  You have to keep track of who is telling the story or it becomes confusing.  It switches between three women and when the main one is talking you are never sure if she is imaging what is happening or if she is mentally off.  I enjoyed Gone Girl more, until the last chapters of this book.  A lot of backtracking if you put it down and then want to pick up again.  Good if you have nothing else on your mind and can spend hours just on this story.  My husband found the same thing when he started reading it.......he gave up on it."
"This book is good, but not great.  I don't have much to add to what has already been written.After reading reviews, I expected more. While it was certainly a page-turner, it was also predictable.  I don't find the comparisons to Gone Girl to be accurate. I greatly enjoyed Gone Girl, but this book didn't quite meet expectations.I purchased the book, and wish I had borrowed from my library.I will read subsequent novels from Hawkins, however, as I think she will hit her stride."
"I was on vacation in Mexico and saw so many people with this book. I was super interested so I checked it out. I enjoy a good mystery and this one kept my attention. The only thing that I had a problem with was that I didn't really like the characters in the book and it seemed very easy to figure out who, in the end, was the reason for the mystery. I think it was a good read though and recommend it."
"On recommendation, I picked this up. I liked the interwoven life stories of the main characters, but it felt there was a decided lack of connection between the tertiary and main characters. An interesting approach to the storytelling, though I didn't find any of the characters at all likable. Except for maybe Rachel, who I didn't like until the last 30 pages."
When I saw the trailer for the movie I was instantly drawn to read the book. I could not put it down and read most of it in one day. I highly recommended this book and have to a colleague already. There was nothing I disliked. The book was well written.
"I don't feel this lived up to the hype. I found the characters and plot to be rather one-dimensional. None of the characters are likable nor do they seem realistic because their flaws are all so grossly exaggerated... The plot ""twists"" are, in general, predictable. However, I did make it to the end, which, I guess, made it an okay read."
"What a terrific book! Brilliantly done, what a blast. There are many wonderful surprises in store, certainly, with plot and character and also how the story is told. Even better, though, is the clear concise writing and perfectly drawn characters, Rachel, the lead, in particular. The less you know the better. Get this book and enjoy. I cannot wait to see what Hawkins comes up with next."
"This novel was worth every star. Author hit it out the park with this one. Provides mystery, believing in ones self and thoughts despite what others think. If you get a chance see the movie, which will not disappoint. Good who done it"
1st Half of the book very confusing had to keep track of the dates and which character was talking. 2nd half much better.  Finally got to the end and everything came together. The good thing about the book was it's short chapters.Would not compare this to Gone Girl as someone had said.Would not recommend this book.
"The Girl On The Train is getting all the buzz as ""the book"" of 2015.  It's February!  But, I think the buzz is worthy.  There are comparisons to Gone Girl which are somewhat valid.  It's an unpredictable ride and has characters you will care about (and others you won't) but they're not typically sympathetic.  The perspective is unique to a mystery/thriller.  Just read it!"
"The book was fine.  I didn't love it and didn't hate it.  Started a new book (Room) the next day and totally forgot I even read this until I was asked to write a review.  Now, Room, had me all sorts of depressed.  I'd rather feel something (depressed) than nothing (this book)."
"We read this book for my book club. In the beginning it's hard to sort out the characters, but once you get into it you'll get hooked. There are intriguing depictions of alcoholism, depression, infidelity, love, the loss of children, and the suburban dream. The story is set in a rainy, dreary town outside London and features interludes of transit via the famous train system."
"More 3 and a half stars really. Slow to get into, but I bought  it anyway, as it seemed to have a good reputation. Glad I did, as I found it quite intriguing. Couldn't really warm to any of the characters, but I liked their complexity, and the complexity of the narrative and timeline layout."
"I just completed this thriller, which will be reviewed by my book club this summer.  It was a little hard to follow initially, because of all the twists and turns and the fact that I have a Kindle copy, when a paper book may have made follow-along easier.  I made a paper list of all the characters and their parts in the novel, and loved the book thereafter."
"Loved the main character Rachel. The author did an incredible raw job of portraying the life of an alcoholic. The book was overall good though I figured out the ending quite soon. No crazy plot twists. I am glad I read it, fun read. I've heard rumors of a movie later this year and would see that too."
"I really liked this book, so much so that I leant it to my coworker who also really loved the book and got her started on audio books to listen to while commuting to and from work.  This one kept my interest and I think is in the works to being made into a film. Recommend this one."
"Honestly, I saw the movie trailer and wanted to read the book ahead of seeing it.  The book depicts Rachel and Megan as flawed, sympathetic people, but it never really had me on the edge of my beach chair.  I'm looking forward to the movie."
"Slow to begin but definitely picked up suspense as each chapter carried on. Wish the author provided a little bit more background on the characters.  As it took some time to figure out who was protagonist/antagonist were, some things seemed disconnected.  I kept thinking the red haired man from the train could have some more to do with everything.  Good read"
A good story with believable characters. Rachel  is an alcoholic who discovers that her drinking hid more than what she realised. Anna is Rachel's replacement in more ways than one  and Tom doesn't want the past and present to meet up.
"Too much hype. I really expected more. Modern day women allowing themselves to be abused by men. Sorry, I don't see how this book received any good reviews. It was difficult to finish and a disappointing ending."
"I purchased this book to read on our recent trip to Mexico, expecting as usual, I'd have some still left to read on the plane ride home. This book was so addicting, though...not only did I finish it in 3 days, my husband picked it up and started it as soon as I finished. He, too, finished it in 3 days. Pulls you in and makes you want more. I definitely recommend."
A good story once you got used to the style. It was enjoyable but predictable. I figured out the ending long before the story itself was even close to getting there. It was compelling though and worth the read. A few hours in a single sitting.
I liked the detail and imagery. I felt like I was right there with all the characters. The date switching was a little confusing I kept forgetting when it was... i recommend this for people who like a good mystery and suspense.
"It started out as what I might have considered ""hard to read"" but then got very interesting real quick.  I couldn't put it down.  I was so hooked.  I'm excited to see the movie.  With a suspense, maybe it can live up to the book.  :)"
"This book was compared to Gone Girl in a review I read and that is in no way accurate. I understand the comparison for a very surface reason but, no. GG was excellent, IMO. While I did have a problem putting this book down 65% of the way through, the end was meh."
"This is a good read. The characters are well developed, none of them very likeable, except maybe the roommate.  I think it's a very good story, it kept me in there. so if you like a murder mystery, this is a good one!!"
I simply found it uninteresting although the idea of having the story revolve around a girl's observations over time as she views things out her train window was innovative. The book was just not for me.
"Well written novel that delves into self doubt and alcoholism without coy metaphors. The characters are unique, some are tropes but the main characters are complex and intriguing.I didn't know what to expect from the book's vague descriptions and it was best that the plot wasn't spoiled for me. Don't read too many reviews. Just read it."
"I watched the movie first , I thought the book would be awful because I fell so in love with the movie but j was wrong I was just as wrapped into the book!"
"when you need something new to read, this book might be interesting"
GREAT BOOK. ONE OF THE BEST THAT I HAVE READ.GREAT BOOK. ONE OF THE BEST THAT I HAVE READ.GREAT BOOK. ONE OF THE BEST THAT I HAVE READ.GREAT BOOK. ONE OF THE BEST THAT I HAVE READ.GREAT BOOK.

I loved this novel. Very suspenseful and a shocker at the end.  The plot is interesting and I like protagonists who are deeply flawed as human beings. II would have given it a five but that was reserved for Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn.
This is a really well written book and deserves five stars for the writing. But I rated it down because all but one of the characters are just so unlikeable and the book is really depressing. It does keep you guessing though. Really good murder mystery!
"I wasn't sure about the book at first, I had just finished ""Gone Girl""  so I read a little and then put it down for a while. I had a friend tel me how good it was, so I started reading it again. This time I couldn't put it down excellent book, characters well developed."
"A good read.  I like books instead of movies, so this was one that I might've gone to ""see"" in the theatre...  (I know there's a movie now and am considering it.)  Loved the twists and turns and the ending."
"Well written, good character development, plot decent but is hinged on the deficiencies of the main character which should  be interesting ( nice change from the strong leading lady type) yet was sometimes tedious."
"I highly recommend the book.  Before I bought the book, I read reviews that were critical of the author. But I bought it anyway and am glad I did.  The story is told from the perspective of the central character, a struggling alcoholic who spends much of her time in a daze searching for reality. I found the plot engaging with elements that reminded me of Hitchcock's Rear Window."
There was about 5 different chapters near the end of the book that made it draw out and it made me not a huge fan. All & all it was a pretty good book. I feel like those who aren't heavy readers would love this book!
Bought this book based on the reviews.  Kept on reading it thinking it would get better but after more than half way through I gave it up..  I really don't get why this book is popular.  Psychological thriller... you got to be kidding.  It's just page after page of personal rambling by two self obsessed characters.  I did not care about the characters and the plot was flimsy at best.
This book held my interest. It had some surprises and it was a pretty fast read.
"Rarely have I continued to read a book when I did not care much for any of the characters.  This one was an exception.  Every character was severely flawed, and all of the male characters were awful, but I kept reading due to the suspense which built.  Even though the outcome was predictable I kept reading.  It was a vary interesting novel and perhaps I surprised myself a bit."
"Was very slow to get into, the first half (and maybe more) is pretty dull and uninteresting. However if you stick with it all the way through, you'll be page turning by the middle of the second half. Interesting character jumps for different perspectives, but becomes very predictable. Overall an ok who done it mystery, but nothing spectacular."
"This is a story of two neurotic  women, back and forth. The story could been told in about 25 pages instead of repeating and repeating.I finished it  because I paid 6.99 for it and did not want to feel I wasted that much money.  But I felt that way anyway,"
It was entertaining. I wanted to read it before seeing the movie. The details in the book filled in the blank spaces that the movie left out. it was a fascinating look at several different characters and their thoughts.
"I loved reading this book.  I was constantly questioning the validity of the story being narrated.  I never wanted to stop reading.  This was a great book, and everyone I've recommended this book to has also enjoyed it.  The characters are all interesting, and I never knew what road the plot development was going to lead down."
"I wasn't sure about this book after I read the sample, but I'm happy I ordered the full book. I ended up reading it in 2 days!  The intertwining of the characters was done in a interesting way. Very believable how this whole scenario could of take place. Makes your realize how relationships can make or break a person."
I had to think hard before I gave this 4 stars. It was one of those books that made you very frustrated with the central character but definitely a page turner if only to see how much further her life could spiral downwards.Is she an obsessed alcoholic nutcase or maybe she is onto a darstardley deed which may have been committed within her microcosm of life.The pace and action gets better as the book progresses and the story being told in the first person by 3 of the characters is interesting.A bit of a chick flick that this male enjoyed.
"This is a book that intrigued me from the outset.  The main character seems to be so weak and disturbed, but I found myself rooting for her anyway, wanting her to get herself straightened out.  I didn't know when I began reading that the book is a whodunnit, and I kept changing my mind about the identity of the perpetrator.  The author did a wonderful job of revealing the various stories of each of the players and their parts in the mystery.  She kept me in suspense.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a murder mystery."
"In the mood for a mystery, I dove into this pretty well-reviewed tale. Were it not for wanting to see if the killer was who I thought it was, I finished it. As a mystery, I found it wanting but, worse, as a story, it has an appalling number of shallow and seemingly stupid women. The men don't come off much better. One character, while naïve, was recognizable, even appealing. Another, a practicing alcoholic was so excessive in her commitment to being drunk daily I could just about smell the liquor. A good mystery balances on credibility. I found this had none."
"The story moved at so slow pace that I became annoyed. I was also annoyed at Rachel, the protagonist, for her inability to give up the booze and get on with her life. However, as I read on, I found myself anxious to  get to the end of it all. So I did, and so I'm glad I read THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN."
"I could have, actually should have, stopped reading this about half-way through, but since it is on the Bestseller List (which I should know better -- that does not translate to a good read), I persevered, hoping that it would get better.  Half-way through the book, I'm thinking that each chapter is a rewrite of the previous chapter --  Rachel the drunk conjures up a life for people she has seen but has never met.  Well, except for Tom, he ex-husband, who she continually harasses along with his wife.Find another mystery because this one has no surprises."
"Interesting plot, but After awhile I found myself one step ahead of each character none of whom I cared about. I thought there could at least be one ""normal"" character to be sympathetic for. Too much drunkeness, unfaithfulness, violence, and psychosis for me. Reading it on the kindle, I had to keep looking back to see which character I was reading about. Parts of it really dragged. 3 stars for the plot."
"This seemed slow and depressing for the first 20 pages or slow, but THEN...I couldn't put it down! Although almost all of the characters are so flawed you just want to shake them, you have to keep reading to find out what happens next. This is one of those books that you keep thinking about the characters even when you are done reading. I love a murder mystery and ""The Girl On The Train"" did not disappoint."
"This was recommended by Amazon as I enjoyed Gone Girl. This novel is told by three people. Each chapter is by one of them. The ex-wife, Rachel; the new wife Anna; and the neighbor Megan.The story is good throughout, however the ending ended so quick. When confronted, the murderer immediately confessed and gave all the details of the crime. No real suspense at the end.Is a good book, just a horribly written ending."
"I couldn't put this book down. There's something about each of the characters that makes you genuinely care about them. Feel for them. Suspenseful, exciting, deep, well written. Definitely worth reading!"
"You truly never know what goes on inside of a person's life. Personally or within a relationship. Hooked from the beginning, this truly is an unforgettable story of friendship, love and betrayal at its best...."
"This story is told in first person by three different women and Ms. Hawkins does a great job of making each one interesting and distinctly different from the others.  The story is well crafted but somewhat grim and the ending is a little too tidy, especially for Rachel - the titular Girl on a Train.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book and recommend it as a good summer beach read.  I probably won't remember I read it in 10 years - but not every book needs to be mind altering literature."
"I read this book in about a day!  It was captivating and thrilling until the very end! This is a new author to me. My son recommended this to me many months ago!  But it took me a while to get into it.  Once I did, I couldn't put it down!"
"I'm a reader not a writer so my reviews are normally brief . I don't think this book lived up to all the hype . To me it was just another mystery with a lot of improbable parts in the plot .  I would not recommend this book because there are a lot of other better mystery novels out there . Read ""The Girl from Kraków"" instead."
"I really like this book. It was promoted as a thriller, like Gone Girl and it lived up to that promotion. I liked if that Rachel was very flawed, probably more flawed than most of us. Although some may say that the ending is too easy for her, I liked it. It is only human for us to be hopeful for someone who has suffered so much. Being an avid reader of mysteries and thrillers, I had pretty much figured out who it was that did the deed, but getting there is the real journey and this was a good trip. A good read."
The idea of the main character looking out the train windows at the houses by the track was a great way to carry the reader along the ride. It is a great ride with things changing all the way through from what you think they are. I enjoyed the book's mystery and felt the angst of the main character with her weaknesses. It is her making poor choices all along that take us through the story. Surprises will keep you and her guessing.
"Our book club read the book and discussed last evening.  I personally would not have finished the book without this motivation because I thought the story was depressing and the characters hopeless.  However, others loved the mystery and other facets of the book and we had a lively discussion."
The most amusing fact about this book is that each character had flaws. The plot kept you interested and you couldn't help but root for Rachel to get her life in order. The common theme that keeps repeating is that not everything is as it seems when looked at from a distance.The book had several twists and jumped back and forth in time. I enjoyed the story as well as the pace that it was told. It gave the reader time to feel like they met each one of the main characters. Enjoyable and suspenseful.
"While this was no ""Gone Girl,"" the book was very entertaining. The twist became somewhat predictable towards the middle of the book, but you still had the ""who done it"" vibe going on because you were not quite sure. I do like the way the main character, Rachel, is developed through the story. We don't often have black-out drunk, unreliable narrators, which was a nice change of pace. I wasn't sure to believe what she was saying as much as she was unsure of herself."
This has to be one of the most over hyped books for some time. Basically nothing happens for 200 pages.Hours of my life I'll not get back.Major disappointment. Eminently put down-ableEach to their own.
"Absolutely one of the best books I've ever read-and I read a lot!  I was able to find it easy to relate to the main female character which was probably one of the strong points of appreciation for me. After this book I can't wait to read something else by her.  The story was presented well.  Excellent writing, character development and it held my interest the whole way through."
"The book was okay, from all of the hype I expected much more. I had the who dunnit figured out early on so the characters started to become annoying for being dumb. There are many books where the writing and plot are far more intriguing."
I cannot understand why this book is on the USA Today best seller list.  It is dull and redundant.  The story can be told in 100 pages or less.  Reading it was a trudge thru dull factors.  I am sorry I wasted my time and money.
"Fantastic mystery! This is well-paced with perfect character development. The characters are flawed but are not forced upon the reader, and the story reveals itself wonderfully. The ending is the only part which could be improved - it is satisfying yet the way it could have been portrayed a little tighter. Highly recommended!"
When I started this book I didn't like it. I almost gave up on it but one of my friends who read the book said read more of it so I did. Great advice it's a good read. I couldn't put it down. It had me all the way to the end.
"I would have given it five stars but the ending was way too over the top for me. It felt like the author just got tired of developing the main characters -- or simply decided to give up on them. I couldn't put it down until that weird end. And then, when I put the book down, I was disappointed. You should read it to see if you agree with me. :-)"
"I loved this book, the plot and characters.  I did not want to stop reading it.  The characters are well developed and you can sympathize with them. The book is suspenseful and dark at times. I would definitely recommend this book."
"It was ok. Not good, not terrible.  The story was fine, but about 100 pages could have been shaved off due to repetitive writing and details. Yes, we know she is a drinker. Yes, we know she can't remember what happened on Saturday night. Yes, we know her life is a mess.  I don't know why so many compare it to Gone Girl.  Overall it's fine, but not one I would recommend."
"This is a ridiculously good read. It starts off with a woman who is an alcoholic and you really can't identify with her, but you keep reading as her life gets worse and worse and are exposed to other characters and the plot develops. Very difficult to put down, I read this in 2 days and had to restrict myself or would have done an all nighter.  Very enjoyable <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0080>"
"I did like any of the characters in this book.  I felt that they were all so needy, winey and uninteresting.  I could not wait to finish the book.  I knew something was going to happen but could not figure it out until close to the end. I could not understand why the husband Tom put up with Rachel like he did.  I definitely would not recommend this book."
"The characters in this novel are reminiscent of the characters in Gilian's Flynn's novels.  By that I mean that the characters are all very unlikeable.  With that said, I enjoy reading unlikeable characters, they're more real to me than likeable characters.  Watching Rachel drowning her broken heart in gallons of wine is like watching a train wreck.  I felt like a rubbernecker the whole way through.  I wanted to turn away, but you just couldn't.  Hawkins keeps the pace moving along nicely throughout.  I literally could NOT put down this book.  Highly recommend!!!"
"I found The Girl on the Train to be quite gripping and compelling.  However by the end of the story I was fed up with the three women, all far too self indulgent and precious.  I also thought that not telling the story sequentially was confusing at times."
"After the rave reviews, I was somehow expecting more.  Although I didn't expect the ending, the style in which the book was written was not gripping. A good read but forgettable.  I think the author shows promise and her future novels will be better."
"I ""got with it"" towards the end of the book.  But I almost put it down completely at the beginning/middle. It did not seem realistic to me.  Most people would never have taken the chances the heroin did (drunk or sober).  I'm just sayin'."
"Plot suspenseful and characters engaging. Language and style clear and direct. The literary value would not be judged as lofty for its beauty of imagery, language (vocabulary and turn of phrase) but it captured the atmosphere of all its settings (train, tunnel, houses, etc,), the emotional states of its characters, and sustained interest in its outcome until the end. A fun read and an intriguing mystery."
"I almost stopped reading it at first because it did not catch my interest, but, then I figured out who was who.  I liked how I had no idea who did the killing.  I also thought that he would end up on the train tracks getting hit by the train.  This is the first book I have read by Paula Hawkins, too."
"It was gripping from start to finish. A brilliant book to choose for a book club as there is so much to talk about.....the characters are so complex and one waits to find out what hideous things are going to happen next. It is so well constructed that you are just waiting for the next event to take place!! Without giving too much away, it comes with a husband who has a problem with women and that is not fully understood until it is too late!!!"
"I couldn't stand the main character Rachel.  It seemed she made every problem worse, and, she was so needy. It was interesting hearing from three women's perspective.  She made up a fantasy of the people she could see from the train in her old neighborhood. She was seen as a crank by the police. It was fascinating how she worked on her memory to piece what really happened in her life."
"This was an excellent murder mystery. If you picture in your head it reads as an Alfred Hitchcock type story. The story is told from the point of view of three main characters. One character happens to commute to work daily by train. As she rides by her former home she thinks she's made some interesting observations, these tie in with a crime. One problem though, could her drinking habit have addled her memory of the events? The only way to find out is to read this well written murder mystery,you'll enjoy all the twists and turns in the plot."
"From the first page, you believe this woman is a victim attempting to struggle through a major recovery of her life. To straighten out what is real and what is fantasy letting herself fall into a daydream because it's just easier, to blame others, and they help her remain the victim. But then she begins in earnest to sort things out and the reader is swept along on her journey. Gripping and it doesn't let go till the end."
"Three women telling their stories, of which one is the main character Rachel. All three are interesting characters. Two of them are quite damaged. I didn't really connect with them as a reader but their stories nonetheless kept me involved. I must say I was surprised that I liked the book as much as I did. I cannot really say why here without giving away the ending. But I never got bored or wanted to move ahead in the book. Reading these women's stories and what they are thinking was rather absorbing."
"ok....really tried to like this book.  First off, Rachel drives me crazy!  What an idiot and just made me so impatient.....kept skipping forward hoping the book would get better.  The ending was predictable, figured it out after a couple of chapters.  Hate the whole going back and forth with characters and dates.....gets confusing after awhile.  The ending was the best part and still not that great....sorry, don't see what is so great about this book and why it is #1."
I didn't really find this book to be as great as everyone hyped it up to be. I found the main character a little annoying and dumb. The story and twist was unexpected but I really felt I just could not like the main character. The failure of an alcoholic stint got old very quick.
"The Girl on the Train was difficult to put down once I started reading. The characters are relatable and the plot suspenseful. A quick-read that is not overly thought-provoking, but certainly enough to keep the reader's attention.  The equivalent of a Law & Order binge session in the form of a book."
"This is a very well written book.  The author has a visceral style of writing that is quite gripping, appropriate for what turns out to be a murder mystery.  My problem with it is the unlikable characters!  None of the people seem fully realized.  They are all rather shallow and self centered.  I also got the impression that this author definitely doesn't like men in general.  I wouldn't want to give the story away and it is a good story, but the male characters are all rather thugish in a slick way."
"Good premise, but nothing mind blowing. I'm a bit biased because I loved Gone Girl, and this wasn't at that book's level. Still, the main character was such a train wreck it made the book worth the read."
"Don't read this book on your Kindle. You have to keep track of the dates & it's hard to do on the Kindle. I finally just wrote them down on a piece of paper to keep from getting so confused. Great book, a little confusing at first, but it will hold your interest & you will become one of the characters."
"Very well written, the author does a really good job in keeping you interested in the main character even though she is an alcoholic, definitely not the usual loving innocent leading character.... ; one of those books you cannot stop reading."
"While touted as a ""must read"", the women characters were not appealing or likeable.  The girl on the train is a self-pitying whining drunk.  Her best friend and landlord allows herself to be taken advantage of.  The women whom the girl on the train observes from the train  and interacts with beginning mid-way through the story are hiding terrible secrets and crimes.....Not a pleasant read"
"This author, from my experience, knows firsthand about alcoholism and all of its terrible manifestations. Cheating, lying and most telling, self deceit. Creepy feelings and memories - reading this story - I could not put it down and it makes my skin crawl at the same time. WELL DONE.  I am a voracious reader but I cannot recall another novel which so accurately describes the personal feelings of blackout, self incrimination, etc etc etc.  ""Constitutionally incapable of being honest with ourselves"" I.e. We lie to ourselves about ourselves and we believe it""."
"Some compare this to ""Gone Girl"" for the psychological thriller element but I think this book stands on its own merit. This book did take me awhile to get through but I think it was because of the three voices used to tell the story. I did not guess the ending until it was made clear so I must applaud the author for a wellcrafted story that hid the truth under several hundred pages."
"It is really rare for a book to be so interesting that I can't put it down, but this one I just couldn't stop reading! The storyline is very well organized so that the characters are not confusing to keep straight. If you like a good mystery, this one is for you. Hopefully this will be a movie soon! This would be a fabulous summer book for you on vacation."
One of the BEST books I have read lately!  Going to get other books by Hawkins for sure!  It certainly has a lot of surprises in it....I didn't figure it out ahead of time!  I would HIGHLY recommend it.  Quite a few of my friends have read it and also loved it.  Hawkins style of writing is GREAT!I've heard she has already sold the movie rights.....now can't wait for the movie!
"II can only rate what I read as I did not complete the book.  Personally, I thought itwas difficult to follow.  The characters were always vague and strange - hard to know who was who - what was realand what wasn't.  A dreamlike book - i prefer more down to earth characters and realistic circumstances.  ."
The story starts out a bit slow but then gains speed in the middle. At first I was annoyed by the way Rachel was drinking but when I found out why it made sense. I felt like she was a character I could not relate to but after hearing her trials I felt like she was a friend and I was hoping she would turn out for the better. Definitely a good read!
"The Girl on the Train hooked me with the very first paragraph, forcing me to finish it in a little more than half a day. Classic unreliable narrator tale, with richly drawn characters, twists, turns, and cinematic descriptions."
You can figure the whole thing out by the middle of the book.  That was disappointing for me but still a fun read
"I enjoyed reading this story. I liked the the three characters the novel followed: Rachel, Megan and Anna. Very intriguing until the last page. Perhaps knowing what causes Tom to behave the way he did would have been an added bonus (ie childhood). Getting to know the root cause of his psychosis would have been an added bonus.  A good read for sure and very entertaining!"
Excellent book...completely took me by surprise at the end!
very interesting read! i didnt want to put it down till i found out what happened and how it happened. the characters were develeoped nicely and well written drama. makes you think about your own life and how we live and treat others and what lies do we all tell ourselves and the ones we love? nicely done book!
"This is the most over-rated book I have ever read. It's OK.  Not great.  The lead in the story is so depressing and the story is one awful event after another.  I read so much about this book and it was so touted, that I finally broke down when the price dropped.  There are so many awesome books out there.  This is a waste of time."
"So much more than I expected! I have to admit I did figure it out right before the end. At first, I was disgusted with Rachel and then I began to see what had happened to her. A great story in that it shows how life is not always how it seems or appears. After I finished reading the story, I thought about Rachel for days afterwards. Very intense story."
Slow start but the pace builds up and then tails off a bit towards the end..
"A bit of editing could have made this book a bit tighter. The same phrases were used multiple times. Some of the descriptive phrases,however, were quite lovely. Overall, I recommend as a great rainy weekend book."
"Excellent story, well written. Unexpected ending and great characters. It goes to show that you cannot even trust your own shadow and that memories can also be lies or constructed as such. Five stars. Hoping the movie does it justice."
My alarm goes off during the workweek at 4:30 a.m. and there have been plenty of mornings since I started this novel when my eyes were bleary from late nights.  A definite thriller and I look forward to reading more from Paula Hawkins.
It was good and suspenseful right up until the end when it was all wrapped up in a neat package by the perpetrator's confession.  Unrealistic and not creative writing on her part.  Seemed actually lazy to end it that way.
A great read. Good characters with lots of twists and turns. I had several changes in my feeling towards the main character ranging from disdain to compassion. I had read the reviews prior to purchasing and nearly didn't read it because someone said the characters were too complicated and confusing. But I am glad I went with the other reviews that liked it.
Man I was sad when I got to the end of this book! It was so good- couldn't put it down. I actually looked forward to getting home so I could read more. I find myself recommending to everyone. It arrived in great condition and in a timely manner. Happy to have it in my collection
"I really enjoyed reading this book. It was not hard to get in to. I am a rather slow reader but once I reached the halfway point, I read on my Kindle, I had a hard time putting it down. I can't wait to see how they did with the movie."
"This novel is a great read for anyone who enjoys mystery, suspense, and multiple perspective narration. The psychological elements of the novel are fantastic! Don't expect a surface read. There are a ton of subtleties that deserve contemplation in order to be truly appreciated. Highly recommend this to anyone!!"
"Much like ""Gone Girl"", this novel features unreliable narrators, a murder with the standard 'the husband must have done it"" attitude, and unexpected twists and turns.  It also plays with the notion that each spectator of the same event can walk away with a completely different 'vision' of what actually occurred, and what we think we know about relationships from brief glimpses of someone's lives may not live up to what we have created them to be in our imagination. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It was a quick and satisfying read!"
"The story is told thru the thoughts of three women who have a common denominator of living on one street in a suburb of London. A commuter train runs in the back of the homes on the street. One woman watches the back yards of the houses as she rides the train and dreams stories of the residents that live in the homes.  Two remaining women who live in these houses next to the train tracks live their own lives within their own fantasies.The story is one of the most compelling I have read since "" Big Little Lies"" which is told in a similar fashion."
"The kind of book that you can't put down. You have to know what happens. But it's also so infuriating, the way the story unfolds. It's one of the most original stories I've read, and I love the style it is written in."
"The book started well, but began to drag halfway through, and towards the end it was very tough slogging. I couldn't wait to be finished. One expects a good mystery story to build in suspense, not peter out as this book did . Character development is not necessarily an essential part of a mystery. Even so, the characters in this novel were annoying to hysterical, and I never cared what happened to them."
"Good read, especially since I ride a commuter train myself everyday and have often wondered about the people living in the houses along the way.  The author's style of flipping back and forth between the three main female characters was initially a bit confusing and required some re-reading."
"A tale of dreary, boring people (women, not GIRLS) leading miserable lives.  I'm about half way through and am not enjoying it.  Not sure if I'll bother to finish - so far, I don't care what happens to any of these one dimensional  characters. Not as bad as Gone Girl, though.Now that I'm really thinking about this over-hyped  waste-of-money, I've decided that it goes into the give-away pile today."
"Reading A Girl on the Train is a fast moving train! You cannot put the book down once you start and you will be amazed at the pace you travel through this book. I've not picked up a book I've whipped through like I did with this one, in many years. The book is fun, filled with mystery and  quirky characters. Each chapter empties you out into the stream-of-consciousness, first-person thoughts of several of the characters (one per chapter). I could not wait to see who 'done' it and you won't be able to either! Read it--you won't be sorry."
I'm so glad I gave this a try because its one of the best stories I have read in a long time. I read a review that said this is like a grittier version of Gone Girl and I can see the comparison but I think this book is much better. I didn't really like Gone Girl but The Girl on the Train was great. All of the characters are flawed but they feel like people I could know. The characters of Gone Girl just seemed a bit unrealistic to me. I would go into more but I don't want to give too much away. It's a great mystery that I really enjoyed. I didn't want to put it down.
"Shallow, contrived and unconvincing. Not one character of any depth or substance or even credibility . The author appears to have become entangled in a web of nonsense masquerading as some kind of plot from which there is no credible escape. I can find nothing to recommend in this awful book."
"Interesting story. Keeps your attention. At  times it is confusing with the character change. Some parts of the story don't make sense. For example new wife talks to parents, but they never mention that he borrowed money."
I enjoyed this book very much. It was a real page turner. You were really on that train every day with the Narrator. The fact that she has problems all over the place makes the reader identify and sympathise with her. Though I did guess the final outcome it was still very satisfying.
"Although three-quarters of the way I predicted the villain in the book, it was interesting to see how it played out, although I wish the ending would have been a little more creative as the beginning of the book.  It was a great read for a vacation book and I enjoyed it greatly.  I recommend 4 stars instead of five because of the lack of plot at the end."
"I couldn't wait to finish this book, hoping the end would clarify my confusion while reading it.  It did, but everything about the book was irritating.  The main character kept harassing and bothering everyone and I felt like she was doing  the same to me.  It has been on all the bestseller book lists for a long time and I always assume (yeah-I know) they are going to be really good stories.  Not true in this case."
"The book was easy to get into and was captivating right away.  About midway through I found it a little overwhelming that people abuse themselves by drinking so much, making so many poor uneducated choices and are actually wandering on the streets.  Even though this was ""fiction"" my take on it is that anyone could find a woman such as this in any city in the US.  It is really sad."
"Rarely do you read a murder mystery where you haven't a clue until the very end whodunit.  Rachel, Anna, and Megan were complex. Interesting characters.  I would read this book again just to see what I may have missed in the first reading."
"Should have been a short story, didn't like one character in the book, I don't know who hypes these books, but somehow they become best sellers, HOW?"
It almost drove me crazy and the most of the time I was desperately pissed of with every character. But needless to say that it is very catchy and fascinating story which made me feel the whole range of emotions.Good detective line)
"Loved the main character Rachel. The author did an incredible raw job of portraying the life of an alcoholic. The book was overall good though I figured out the ending quite soon. No crazy plot twists. I am glad I read it, fun read. I've heard rumors of a movie later this year and would see that too."
"I enjoyed the true train wreck of this book- at times, I was so irritated with the main character and her drunken pity party that I wanted to throw the book across the room but then I couldn't, because I wanted to know how the story untwisted.  Indeed what a twisted story it was.... at any rate, in the long run, I'd recommend it if you can stand some mopey, black outs from the main character."
"An alcoholic who experiences blackouts tries to remember what she saw on the night a woman was murdered.  The character is able to remember feelings but not events.  Some situations in this novel seem implausible, as do the actions of the characters at times.  The main character is not particularly sympathetic.  The ending was easy to predict."
"Twisty turny...quite a ride. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Trying to say what it is that makes it such a page-turner is impossible for me, but it is definitely a book to put on your list. Such realistic characters in such unrealistic situations, but, at the same time...how the hell did they get there?  I loved it. I recommend it as a great story. A great read."
"When I got to 21% done, I bailed and looked up the ending on the internet.  Ho Hum. I cannot imagine what the hype was all about.  This wouldn't have made an interesting episode of Law & Order:  Criminal Intent."
"Good read.  Book had some unusual twists.  The book is written from the perspective of the three main female characters -- they all see fundamentally the same situations but from their unique perspective.  Also had a time line as the book shifted from woman to woman....eventually I just ignored the time line and focused on the story from each woman.  The ending was somewhat predictable but still had a few twists which made me say ""Didn't see that coming."""
"A throughly enjoyable book, yet I was disappointed with the ending.  The story line is woven in such a way that the reader is lead to believe that it is about multiple personalities.  It would have been much more interesting and thought provoking if each character was truly within Rachel's mind as the reader is lead to believe, as the characters have overlapping traits. The ending was a let down for me!"
"This is really the story of three women. The characters each gradually reveal the kind of people they really are as the story progresses and we discover layer on top of layer in this suspenseful tale of murder, lies, and infidelity. A compelling tale that keeps you guessing until the climax."
This book was my first suspense murder mystery book I have read. It was VERY well written. I was totally immersed in it and couldn't figure out the twist until the author was ready for you to know. It was a little hard as an e-book because the dates for the different chapters changed a lot so I kept trying to go back to figure out the timeline that is just easier to accomplish with a paperback book. I would highly recommend this book to anyone! Glad I purchased it so I could read it again later on.
"What fun—an unreliable narrator. Rachael is a 2 bottles of wine a night, fall down, blackout, drunk. So her narration is suspect. But you still feel that somehow, something happened. She takes the same commuter train every day and makes up stories about other peoples perfect lives. When one of those people go missing, Rachael is sure she can solve the mystery.Nothing is as it seems. And there is an overwhelming feeling of impending doom.I wanted to knock Rachael over the head and say stop drinking, you are in danger.Enjoyed it"
"Clearly not a literary masterpiece, TGOTT is a quick read with a few surprises along the way. I've read comparisons to Gone Girl, and while it does have some twists as the other best-seller had, in my opinion TGOTT is not written as well. I found some of the writing cliched and unbelievable in places. If you can ignore these elements, you will have an enjoyable read (as enjoyable as reading a murder mystery whose protagonist is a sad, unlovable alcoholic can be).Also, I will probably pick up Hawkins next novel to see where it takes me."
I'm not much of a reader but wanted to read this before the movie comes out later this year. I was completely engrossed after the first few pages and read the entire book in less than 2 days. I can't wait for the movie!
Started this book on the suggestion of my daughter.  The author's character development is really good. This book kept my attention and surprised me towards the end - love those type of surprises!  Can't wait for the movie!
Deeply tragic book about human frailties and evils.  The characterization about addictive disordered behavior rings true.  One too many plot twists.
"I had a hard time getting through the first few chapters because the main character was just kind of pathetic at that point. But after that the book takes off once it gets to the mystery part of the story and I enjoyed it. Lots of twists and turns as the story progresses so I was not able to guess ""who done it"" until very near the end. Our book club read this and liked it overall, so I would recommend it if you can push through the beginning of the book."
"clever, suspenseful, dark, raw, gripping, real- took you into the psyche's of the characters- once I started I couldn't put it downThe book's construction was unique, told from many points of view, and the characters were very believable yet complex.  Excellent book!"
"This tale delves into the lives of Rachel and people close to her. She is at the center of a murder, which she insisted on being a part of. Her character is in even, wholly unlikable at times other times somewhat sympathetic and thus weakens the overall story. Neither villain nor hero, Rachel's problematic story drives the narrative with speed, stops and slow points similar to the train she rides daily. Good, but not great."
Once I started this book I couldn't stop. I had just had PRK surgery (a form of LASIK) and my vision was blurry at times but I kept going. I refused to go to bed until I finished. Good thing I'm a quick reader! Highly recommended.
"I couldn't wait to get through this book and stop wondering ""who did it.""  I and don't mean that in a good way. I didn't like the heroine, and the book was one of the worst I've wasted time on, in a long time."
"LOVED this book. Character development was impressive and the story was a ride itself! Mystery-suspense-thriller that captivated my thoughts even when I wasn't reading it. I read ""Gone Girl"" first but ""The Girl on the Train"" is by far my favorite. Fun to read and discuss with a friend as well."
"Trash. When the perpetrator performs a confessional soliloquy with 10 minutes left in the book, you realize that the writer was stumped as to how to resolve any mystery that may have remained at that point and took the easy way out. There is no literary merit to the novel whatsoever. In spite of this, the book moves quickly and manages to evoke a mild guilty engagement (hey - it IS a murder story), which is apparently the inspiration for most of the positive reviews. Hitchcock?! Are you kidding? If there's a crime and a window...?"
"Story is slow at first and a little confusing, but then becomes clear after several pages. It is interesting and sad and a mystery that is solved by a woman who is an alcoholic with accompanying blackouts.She has trials that seem to be insurmountable but has more strength than she ever thought she did. Unique story line, surprisingly powerful lead character, wonderful book. I loved it."
I like this book. It has a very nice flow to the story. My only issue is that I felt like the ending was very predictable and no I did not see the movie first. Overall this was a good book and I would recommend it.
"This novel explores the effect and allure of addiction to alcohol. The main character is well developed and even though the reader doesn't want to, they find themselves rooting for her to overcome her issues and fight for a better life. The storyline draws the reader in and the split perspectives keep them engaged until the end."
"This book is so thrilling but I had to keep my mind clear as it jumps back & forth with each character's memory of things that happened. I want to see the movie but with the reviews I've read, I'm afraid I'll be disappointed!"
Entertaining but slow. You get tired of the main character doing the same things over and over again. Also it's very predictable. Kept thinking something else was going to happen to make it more interesting. A better read written in a similar style (alternating voices/viewpoints) is Gone Girl.
"I purchased this book because it was on the New York Bestseller list. When I begin reading the book, the narrator was so incredibly flawed. She was a hopeless alcoholic who had blackouts and who had lost her job, husband, and house. She was ""a hot mess."" I liked Rachel. She becomes stronger as the book progresses. Please read the book you will love it!"
Loved this book from beginning to end. Whilst Girl on the Train is an easy to read narrative Paula Hawkins has captured numerous aspects of daily life & the twists & turns that can impact upon ordinary people. Paula highlights that a facade can hide the reality of life. An intriguingly good read that gives the reader pause for thought.
Just get it.  A great read
"Should have been a short story, didn't like one character in the book, I don't know who hypes these books, but somehow they become best sellers, HOW?"
The plot and main character were too twisted for me to follow. I quit reading afer 28% of the book. The main character told too many lies to herself and to others for me to understand the characters. The descriptions were good. It is not my cup of tea. It was recommended to me but I will not recommend it to others.
"it was a fast read for me; however, it seemed to get bogged down as the main character kept repeating herbehaviors over and over again ..it made me want to scream at her for never learning a lesson... but then thatsthe first sign of some problems that the character has.  So all in all, I'd have to say it was good writing ... andI liked the surprise ending."
This book keeps you guessing at every twist and turn. Despite not liking the main character in the book I just could not set it down until the very end. All of the players in the story are flawed in some way and the interaction between them makes a good read. Would recommend this book to holiday readers and a quick read audience.
"This book was amazing! I a little slow in the beginning from going back and forth between characters, but once the story starts to unfold it is quite the page turner! The only downfall is finding my next book that in comparable."
"Very well written, with an engrossing plot.  Moving back and forth between female characters takes a bit of getting used to, but doesn't interfere with the forward movement of the plot. The examination of the psychology of the alcoholic and blackouts is realistic. The book made a very long trip seem shorter."
"I did enjoy the way the author wrote the book although I'd have to glance back at times to see who I was reading about. However, I must admit this was the first novel I've read in a long time where I did not like even one character."
"During the first part of the book I was ready to put it aside.  However, as I read on, it became more interesting and I did enjoy the book.  I liked it but I didn't love it hence the 4 stars and not 5.  Probably won't read another of this author's works."
"My sister and I loved the audible version of this book. We listened to it while on a road trip and had trouble shutting it off when we got to a destination.  It is so well written, great character development and always keep us guessing.  The narrator is also excellent.  I highly recommend this book - in print or narrative form."
"This is a good book!  It is fast paced, and goes from one character to the other by chapter.  I did find it a bit confusing at first but once I read more I was able to navigate the flow of the book.  The story of intertwining the female characters is an effective method for building the tension in the story.  The ending is a bit predictible but good.  I recommend."
This novel kept me on my toes and was thrilling from one chapter to the next. There was never a dull moment with any turn of the page. I loved it and am excited to see how the movie turns out but I can already tell the book is way better!!
"The beginning was a bit slow, and it spent too much time focused on the main characters drinking problem.  However around the middle of the novel it got very interesting and was full of twists.  Overall a good read.  I listened on Audible and the reading was done by three different English women who did an excellent job."
"Read for book club, lots of differing opinions, but primarily there were no characters to like or identify with.  Interesting use of short sentences by the author as well as the train as the framework of the story.  So much had to do with Rachael's drinking, we were all fed up with her behavior.  Most did not figure out who ""did it"" until the very end."
"Amazing! Fascinating characters, unreliable narrators that made me question if I had read carefully enough. A better Gone Girl than Gone Girl. Rachel is a pitiable and yet relatable protagonist, and Megan and Anna make deliciously loathsome women. I love a novel centered around such rich and complicated female narrators."
"Book becomes very confusing if you don't read the chapter titles - they have the narrator's name. The title type is a dull grey in the kindle version. I am sure most people read chapter titles, but not everyone. They should have been made more obvious - at least black font in the kindle version. I lent my Mom my kindle book and she was unnecessarily utterly confused thinking it was a multiple personality book. Otherwise, this was a very well-written book."
"I could barely put this book down. A very cleverly constructed psychological thriller-mystery, well-rounded characterizations, and believable scenarios. Nicely ties together at the end. Highly recommended."
"I do not normally like books with multipile narrators but Paula Hawkins pulls it off. The characters are well drawn, especially the principal narrator, the boozy but well meaning Rachel with a romantic view of other people's lives. The more I got into this book, the better I liked it. Ultimately I found it gripping. It has been compared to ""Gone Girl,"" but I think this is much better. I found it very satisfying  and was sorry to finish it.Llewellyn King"
"The idea of a woman observing life from a train window is an interesting concept. When the story is being told from this vantage point, it remains  riveting. However, when the main character is off the train...whether in town or in her apartment... she emerges as unlikeable and foolish and in need of an intervention.  The other voices in alternating chapters add to understanding the whole story. All in all, it was a good book and the author kept me guessing until the end."
"It was a good book. Not the best I've ever read, hence the four stars, but very good. The characters were well created, the plot kept me guessing. I wasn't sure who committed the crime until it was revealed."
"This book kept me interested until the very end. I never wanted to put the books down. I like how each chapter is a different person's perspective and is written in first person. Unfortunately the ending was too abrupt left me feeling ""that's it?"". Overall very good quick read."
"This book is very hard for me to rate, or review. It took me a while to get into the story, but once I did, I read it quickly.  The characters are not inherently likable, but that did make them more interesting and real.Like most novels in this genre, the end felt rushed and a little obvious. Before I finished the book, I would have given it a 5. By the end, it was more like a 3.  I guess I'll settle on a 4..."
"It was a fast, easy read once you realized that the chapters were different characters viewpoint.  The publisher's heading the chapters with the names in such light type caused one to skip over them and created the confusion.  Seems to be a combination of Gone Girl and the true life situations in a couple of murders in the headlines in recent times."
"Good book, quick read. Was not happy with the end. The whole story you get more than 1 perspective about the plot. In the end, you only get one perspective. Would have liked a little more closure. All in all, a good read."
Loved this book. Liked the way Paula Hawkins told one story from the prospective of several characters and became each one of the characters separately in the story. Instead of the usually narrative of a floating outsider or just the prospective of one telling the story. crescendoed masterfully as it spun and tied loose ends.
"The first half of the book was overkill with the drinking problem,seemingly mental problems and self pity. Itt became tiresome. It wasn't until 50% of the way through that it became more interesting and I decided to hang in there to find out the ending."
I recommend everyone read this book.The twist at the end was difficult to see coming.  This is an exceptional novel.
It's depressing & graphic. Every male character is seen as abusive in some way. All 3 female characters' voices sound the same to me. The only one that differed a bit was Anna.  But if you past all that a great murder mystery!
"totally disappointed in this book, very slow moving borderline boring"
"A good weekend read. If you liked Gone Girl, this will not disappoint. Flawed, but genuine characters whose recollections of events aren't always reliable, keep the book moving swiftly to its surprising conclusion. Somehow the characters are sympathetic, even as you question their actions and motivations."
I doze into this book thinking it was a simple cliche mystery and knowing who did it with who and when and where but it completely kept changing its story and then I couldn't putting it down until I knew......
"I find it difficult to recommend a book where all three of the female characters are not particularly likable.  In fact, there isn't a single character in this book that I would want to have coffee with.  Rachel is a tragic alcoholic, Megan is a psychological nightmare and Anna is  selfish, mean spirited and unapologetic about her affair.  And don't get me started about the men."
"I was intrigued with the storyline because it kept me guessing until the end. However, I just was not enjoying the narrative. It seemed to lack, for a better word, intensity.  It was like watching a  great play with poor acting."
"Somehow I knew it was going to be Tom. Still a good read, though. I had a tough time getting into it. Rachel was a tough character for me to engage with, but I managed to stick with it the second time around."
"This was an interesting story.  Written well, I could bring up images of the characters and the community and feel their frustrations and fears.I was surprised at the end.  That's always a good thing :)"
A page turning read that kept me up all night till I finished it.  Quick read - because you can't wait to find out what happens.  A few twists and turns along the way to keep you guessing.  Very well written.
Excellent mystery of an etangled love story that kept me in suspese and actually made me gasp out loud at the finding of evidence.  I knew this would be a great book to read after seeing the previews for the movie and it was!
"The story itself did not match up to the write up about it. It was lackluster, I did not identify with the main protagonist who maintains an alcoholic stupor pretty much throughout the story. The ending was just awful. If I wanted to suspend reality throughout the entire book I would read fantasy or sci fi, not fiction.Don't waste your money!"
I couldn't believe how difficult it would be to relate to the characters and how simplistic they are. All have plenty of complaints. All are bored and boring. They entertain themselves by obsessing. Their sentiments are postcard exercise in banality.The only thing that kept me going was how bad they were getting and curiosity of how much more annoying could they get.
So suspenseful and keeps you guessing! Love the back and forth narration style revealing just enough throughout and all the characters.
While I had some difficulty getting into this story I am really glad I stuck with it. The plot and characters were entwined in such a way that I had to keep reading. The main character invoked feelings of frustration and sympathy. The mystery was absorbing. I would recommend this book to my friends and know they would thank me for it.
"Not in the least bit interesting or entertaining. The characters were not even slightly likeable and I was bored throughout. I'd figured ou the ending and was happy it was over. It was a book I endured, but never enjoyed."
I got my reviews mixed up - the review I gave for The Pocket Wife is actually my review for The Girl on the Train.  This one kept my attention and kept me guessing up to a point.  I figured out before the ending that Tom was the killer.  Did not deter my interest in finishing the novel.  I hope Paul Hawkins keeps writing novels like this one - enjoyed it immensely.
"Quick read, perfectly addicting book for a vacation, although it's pretty dark. I was hooked from the first page to the last page. But it doesn't leave you feeling fulfilled or happy in any way, that's why I gave it 4 stars. It's the sort of book that can make you crabby while you are reading it - you are hooked and want to finish, but the story is bringing you down."
"There was only one character in this book that I liked. Her friend Cathy.  She was the only one that I could relate to.  Everyone else either did or thought evil, selfish things most of the time. Very depressing.  If the world is made up of people like those in this book we are in deep trouble."
"For an airport novel, this was a fun read. Many reviewers have repeatedly compared this to Gone Girl and the Millennium series, but I wouldn't go that far. Flynn and Larson's works were significantly better with deeper characters and more complex stories, while Hawkins' are a bit shallow in comparison.  Otherwise, it's a decent thriller with a unsurprising plot twist."
It was something I just couldn't stop reading. I found it to be confusing in the begining to switch constantly through dates but once you realize what's going on it's an awesome read ! The end is a real deal breaker !!
"This book was a bit of a page turner, although it took a while to figure out who was who in the beginning with all the skipping around. Overall, a decent novel that pretty much held my interest throughout; although at times the main character got sidetracked with retelling too much detail of past events that weren't all that relevant to what was currently happening."
"It was a pretty good novel, not so great a mystery.there were only so many characters and the obvious choices of suspects are ruled out. The culprit becomes clear when all impossibilities are rationalized.I still enjoyed it."
"The first third of the book I found ponderous, so I ended up skimming until things started going a little faster. I thought there was too much character development for an alcoholic, and too much build up to the central theme of the story. But the story flowed better and was more readable in the 2nd half."
"This is not a happy ""feel good about the world"" read. There are no traditional hero types. Instead you are seeing the lives of two unhappy, self-destructive women that are not very likable. However, unsympathic you feel about the characters the author continues to draw you into their lives peeling back the surface and revealing the true vulnerable tragic souls they are."
"A great read. I polished it off in 3 nights. LOL. Of course, i had to ignore my husband to do that. Gripping story, great plot. Can totally see this as a movie. Fast paced. Only one or two sections were a bit slow. I wasn't really a fan of the ending, but over all a very satisfying story with lots of twist and turns. Aummer is coming...take this to the beach and enjoy!"
"This book was fast paced and well written. Told from the point of view of three different women, it was engaging and hard to put down. I would recommend it to those who enjoy psychological thrillers in the style of a Hitchcock story."
"It took me a few chapters to get into this book, but in the end, I truly enjoyed it.  I was not able to predict what happened in the end, which is a major plus.  The characters were well developed, and I could relate to them."
"The Girl on the Train kept me interested.  I enjoyed the story and characters.  I did, however, guess the end about half way thru the story because the author put a few too many hints early on.  But I still wanted to finish it."
"The story is skillfully told, but I cannot say that I enjoyed it.  It took me some time to figure out who the culprit was really going to be, but truthfully, I found it to be a very depressing story. I would definitely not call it  a ""must read."""
The book had me guessing from the start.  I loved the way I got inside the psyche of each character.  I loved the message about self-destruction.  It's going to be tough to find another story that holds my attention link this one has.
"Although I did not start out liking this book and it took me three attempts to get into it, I can honestly say I loved it. Great read once I chose to stick with it. Great plot with teist I did not see coming"
"A interesting view of personalities whose selfishness, prejudice, loneliness and other more caustic characteristics affect their lives. This book will hold your interest and keeps you riveted to the end."
"It was a real page turner, and I hope the movie is good as well.  Makes you think if you really know yourself and can you trust yourself.  Are your doubts really you, or what people have put upon you?  Also makes you think twice about drinking and even thinking about your ex."
"Just one more novel with the psychological setup of who is guilty of something?  Manipulates the reader -- no great reading, just fact afterfact after fact.  Not one of the characters is likeable -- there is no one to root for."
"Although this was not one of my favorites, I still couldn't put it down.  It was kind of a bummer and sometimes frustrating reading about someone who is an alcoholic and the consequences of her actions.  Kind of disjointed, it skipped around a lot and I had to frequently go back to re read certain sections.  But in the end it all made sense."
"I was okay. I found the characters hard to believe. If you were not a fan of Gone Girl, you will probably not like this book either. It was just okay. Fairly predictable. It felt like the author was trying to take you on a ride, but it was too forced. I enjoy books that simply tell a good story instead of trying to weave in complex, often unbelievable characters and plot lines just to keep you entertained."
"This well written thriller is just that- a well written, hard to put down, edge of your seat, page turner.  The plot twists and turns through the voices of it's 3 main female characters.  You start to expect the unexpected as the writer leads you through some harrowing situations and a continuous  stream of really bad choices. The train is a great metaphor for the way we experience life - just passing through or carefully observing the details of everyday living. The author does a good job of playing with your mind. Just when you think you have it all figured out, a new complication arises. I look forward to more books by this author.  I give this book 4 1/2 stars."
"Interesting mystery.  Rachael is about as screwed up as any heroine could be. How it gets through the to the truth is painful but a very good read, especially the way the author easily switches between time."
A bit slow in the beginning.  Reading all the many stupid and unwise decisions and behavior of Rachel gets at time frustrating and annoying. Things pick up later in the book with a good plot-twisting finale.
"Mixed bag. A page turner at times and at other times tempted to quit.  All characters are shallow and unlikable.  They all deserved each other. I read to find out it 'who did it' but the writer was not fair with the details.  Sad, lonely, pained, lying, helpless, hopeless men and women.  Not one ounce of happiness or joy. Story was  too depressing, I wished I skipped it."
"It started a bit sad, and I almost quit reading it as I was looking for something to grab me quick and keep my interest because my ""reading for fun"" time was limited, but I kept with it and it was worth it!  Very entertaining."
"Dark, confusing book! Got lots of good reviews, but I found it not so great! Had hard time keeping the characters straight with the jumping back and forth in the chapters. Had some surprises, but pretty predictable after getting into it. Wouldn't recommend it over many other books, but worth a casual look if you're desperate for something to read."
"Good ""pass-the-time"" novel.  The writer keeps you wondering who-dunit until the end."
"I'm not sure what the big deal is....the book was just ok. I thought the author did a good job with character development, and her insight into Rachel's demons was actually pretty good. I thought the ending was typical."
I am giving only 4 stars because I feel towards the end the book became somewhat predictable. It was also much sadder than I'd anticipated. The pace of the book is fantastic. I read it in 2 days as it really draws you in.
"The dates going back and forth are a bit confussing but its an enjoyable story, although Anna is a depressing character but you learn not to follow her footsteps and that gives you motivation to get the best out of youself."
Somewhat tedious and basic. Fairly entertaining but nothing special. Completely over rated. It reminded me of Gone Girl without a good plot.
"A depressed, pathetic alcoholic is the heroine of this fascinating story which is a page-turning immersion into mundane everyday lives of people who are multilayered and fascinating.  I applaud the author and recommend to my friends."
I read this book in one day! I haven't done that in quite a while. I couldn't put it down! I was convinced that I knew who the villain was several times and each time I was wrong! Headed to find more Paula Hawkins novels!
"Liked the format of different points of view...good building of suspense...Kept me interested and wanting to pick back up to read a few more chapters.Only drawback was that for such  good development of characters/plot/thriller it was wrapped up a bit too neat and quick.  Do like that the main character was left flawed and not ""healed"" at the end.  Satisfying read!"
"Paula Hawkins grabs your attention right from the start and she has you wondering why you might be interested in  a self-admitted drunk on a train. As the story progresses and more characters come alive and perspectives change, you begin to understand why. She keeps you guessing until the end.Great story-teller"
"It was a different but interesting read. People will never operate as you want, as you envision them, or even operate in their own best interest. Sometimes you think that you can separate the good from the bad but not in this book."
"This book is being compared to ""Gone Girl"" but is not even close.  While the plot had several twists and turns, It was illogical and far fetched.  I could find no empathy for any of the characters."
Very creative. The story is told through the eyes of 3 women whose lives become entangled by one of them being murdered. II is a murder mystery but that is only one part of the book. It follows the main character's struggles after her husband leaves her and how her investigation of the murder leads her to revelations which helps her to heal.
"Lots of suspense in this novel. It really grabbed me. Had to immediately tell a friend to read this one. There are alternating characters which really gives it a rich texture. And one of the main characters is taking so many risks that I found myself constantly wanting to jump in the page and say, ""OMG don't do that."""
"Page turner from start to finish.  Couldn't put it down, I needed to know what she knew and how she was going to figure it out.  I will never ride on a train without remembering how she felt, what she saw and how she coped.  Must read for anyone who has been in love!"
"Pick this one up and you'll have trouble putting it down.  It has major motion picture written all over it. I didn't particularly ""like"" any of the characters but I did enjoy the book.  The different voices were written well.  I could picture in my mind scenes and events happening. That's a good thing when reading a book."
"Off to a relatively slow start, the novel gathered steam (no pun intended) and intensity as it progressed.  To keep the characters and story straight, the reader would be advised to pay attention to the chapter titles in order to identify the ""speaker."" The book would have benefited from tighter editing as the main narrator's repetition and angst became tiresome at times.[or so it seemed to this reader.]"
"""Melancholy"" is the adjective that comes to mind in this slow moving thriller. I was amazed to find a second analytical book was written to explain the plot. Our protagonist is just not that complicated and she also suffers from learned helplessness, an undesirable trait in any heroine. However, she does have compassion even if it's clumsily presented. Truly the only touching connection is that which was forged between our heroine and the woman who took her place."
"Kept me in suspense right up until the end, well 80%, according to my Kindle, to be exact. Loved the raw narration of alcoholic Rachel. Perhaps one too many 'digging fingernails into palms', but perhaps that describes the plot perfectly."
"The shifting POVs in this novel don't quite work out.  We start with Rachel, then move to Megan, but Megan's almost 6 months behind Rachel time-wise.  Part-way through Anna gets added to the mix.  The trouble is, if not for the chapter headings, you wouldn't know who's POV you were reading.  The characters' voices are not distinctive enough.  The plot is interesting and engaging, but there's no one to root for her - all of the characters are unlikeable.  All that kept me reading was wanting to figure out how it was all going to tie together."
"Remember your English teacher talking about 'unreliable narrators' ? From Gatsby to Gone Girl, if done right, it makes for a fabulous book. Well, Hawkins gets it right. Rachel has our sympathy, and exasperation, but we KNOW she drinks too much and obsesses over her ex. Megan and Anna are the other two we hear directly from, and while they're a little wacky, we know who we can trust and who we cant....right? The incessant comparisons to Gone Girl irritated me so much that I put off reading this, but I have to say, in many ways The Girl on the Train is the better book. I love the cold bloody, creepy ending of GG better but this was more real, which made it worse---and better."
"I mostly listened to the Audible narration instead of reading the book.  It was easy to keep up with which character was telling her story, because each of the three narrators were different speakers/readers.  I can see that it might be confusing when just reading.  I listened on long plane, bus and train rides in Europe and enjoyed the story."
"I just finished reading this book as I savored it over several weeks.  Because each chapter alternates between characters, I sometimes found myself going back to the start of the chapter to remind myself which character it was I was reading about.I enjoyed how all the characters tied together as well as the outcome, which was not what I was expecting.  I really enjoyed the read!"
"I expected this storyline to be similar to Gone Girl, but it really wasn't. When reading, pay attention to the dates that are the subheadings for each section. If you don't, it could be confusing. The female characters all had some sort of emotional/mental issue, and the male characters were all suspects for me. I was a little disappointed in the climax of the story.... I expected something more unexpected. If you like a mystery, this is an ok read."
"I couldn't read this book fast enough. The suspense of the wonderfully played unreliable narrator was skillfully and thoughtfully written. I did feel the ending wasn't quite as clear as the rest of the story. It was as if it was rushed through too quickly, but that being said I was amazed that I never lost a beat through the character changes and each of their days and nights. Lovely ending. A must read!"
"loved the story but the beginning was hard to follow.  I almost stopped reading it as it was confusing.  I was told by others they felt the same way.  However, that being said; once I continued it was great.  I could not put it down"
"Don't believe the hype, this story is blah. Cared nothing for the characters nor the writing."
Very predictable. I figured out who the killer was right away. Very repetitive
"I've seen this compared to ""Gone, Girl"".  This story doesn't remotely live up to the intricacy or the standard of writing of Gillian Flynn's novel though.  It was a light, engaging read, but it got a little unbelievable somewhere near the mid-end.  The protagonist is thoroughly unlikeable and I just lost patience for her partway through."
The story started slow and was hard to read initially.  After the introduction of other characters you had to stay focused to remember names and incidences. I had to go back and reread some points to link relavent  clues and info.  All-in-all once I started associating characters and subtle clues I enjoyed the book immensely.
I wound up putting down the book. Too wordy for me and too focused on the character's drinking. Expected something quicker paced and less psychological. I love English mysteries but this wasn't the one for me.
"After reading so many good reviews I was looking forward to reading this novel. Sadly, I was quite dissapointed. Maybe my expectations were too high. The characters were not developed and the plot was predictable. On the positive side it iwas a quick and easy read."
"I started reading about a day and a half ago. I would've finished sooner if I didn't have a job and kids ;)From the very beginning, the author creates such emotion that you can't help but sympathize with each of the characters. The added suspense and the way the twist unravels made it literally impossible for me to stop until I knew what happened!"
"The Girl on the Train was one of those books I just couldn't put down!  Every time I thought I had figured things out, another facet of the story came up and changed my guess.  It definitely kept me reading as I couldn't wait to find out what really happened!  Don't pick this book up unless you've got some time to kill because you won't be able to put it down!"
"I can't help but think Hawkins intensely researched the personalities of her characters. Superbly detailed and believable was her rendition of a guilt laden-self-hating alcoholic, intense and abandon-fearing borderline personality, and the perfectly portrayed manipulative textbook narcissist.Well done Hawkins."
"Filled with suspense. Couldn't wait to pick it up to resume the ride. Even though I guessed the culprit, I still wasn't sure til the end. I had very little sympathy for Rachel until understanding the WHY of how her life had evolved as it had. This is an absolutely ""must read"" for lovers of suspenseful thrillers. If you liked Gone Girl, you will definitely like this train ride."
"I have read reviews comparing this story to Gone Girl, but I don't agree with that perspective.  It's an interesting read, but I found my prediction of ""who-dunnit"" to be correct, and that was just around the middle of the book.  The characters were difficult to like...which I suppose could be the comparison to Gone Girl.I enjoyed the book enough to finish it quickly, as it is a page turner.  I gave it 4 stars simply for that reason.  It moves pretty quickly."
Narrative is wonderful--Gone Girl style!  Something about crazy people doing sinister deeds that makes a great story. They are all crazy...the genius in the story telling is figuring out who sets the standard:)
Took me forever to get into the book.  I was over half thru before I got interested enough and understood which characters she was writing about.  Did not enjoy the style of jumping around from character (chapter) to character.  Wanted to quit reading it almost everytime I picked it up until I was about 3/4 thru the book.....then it went almost too fast to the conclusion.  Won't pursue that author again.
"This story is revealed layer, by layer ... alternating point of view as it goes. It's a great way to tell a suspenseful story, but it's frustrating at the same time. I both wanted things to move faster AND I wanted to savor the story. It kept me guessing until the very end!"
"This is a great book to jumpstart discussion.  It moves quickly slowly revealing clues, most of which come from nuances gleaned about the characters.  The dialogue is mostly internal written almost like diary entries.  Seemingly different personality types begin to reveal very similar patterns almost like tracks running parallel to one another.  The train provides a vantage point for assumptions which prove that we all ""see"" what we choose to and fail to see the reality before us."
"Got a lazy weekend ahead of you? This is the book to read. Could do it in a sitting but saved it to savor the intensity, the who done it and the talking back to the characters. A full, fun mystery read!"
I bought this book because a colleague recommended it. I'm a recovering alcoholic (38 years) and the impact alcoholism had on these characters is vividly and realistically drawn. Suspense keeps the reader moving fast through the twists in the narrative.
It seemed a ill like the gone girl with Megan missing and media and stuff....but turned out be a good edge of the. Seat suspense thriller.....just could nth put it down after I was half way through...highly recommended
"I picked this book for my book club this month.  I had a hard time getting through the first half of it and had it not been my book, I probably would have given up on it.  However, it did get better and I think was interesting in the last third of it.  The reasons listed in other reviews are similar to mine in the character development and early on, a difficulty in switching between characters.  I can't say I wouldn't recommend it but I'd warn about the things I've mentioned."
A very contrived and implausibe story with unlikeable narcissitic characters.  I couldn't wait to finish it so I could move onto a better book.
The book pulled me in from page 1. So much more suspenseful when most of the writing takes place in the character's minds. The plot intertwines in such a way that it keeps you guessing until the truth is finally revealed.
I read this because I saw reviews saying it was better than Gone Girl. I think I still liked Gone Girl better because the twist surprised me more. This was a good book on its own with despicable characters easy to hate. Good interesting read. While it kept me guessing I still had a feeling of who the most sinister character was going to be.
"Very intriguing plot/story, if you can look beyond the main character's many flaws. It was often very difficult to read from Rachel's point of view, but the suspense in wanting to know what happened to her and Megan will compel you to continue reading."
Whaat? A contrived plot with not much substance. Not enough detail about characters to elicit emotion for them. Except the alcoholic; and the emotion I felt was disgust..
"This story is told from the perspective of three women whose worlds collide as a result of their choices in life.  The plot turns and twists with each chapter and I can never decide if I Ike or hate the characters because they""re each so flawed.  The common theme of the train and the poetic way the author describes the scenes and feelings kept me reading straight to the end!"
"My wife told how well this book was written, and I was looking for a pallet cleaning from the last series I read. I am so glad I took her advice. Very well done... always looking forward to sliding the kindle open each night. Enough suspense to keep you guessing and a twist that I really enjoyed being fooled by. Kudos ...."
"Started out well, and the premise is intriguing,but it but quickly slid into tedium. The characters were interchangeable, and the plotting and dialogue were clunky. I'm not a huge Gillian Flynn fan, but even she does this same sort of thing much better. I kept waiting for the clever twists, the suspense, the shocking denouement. I'm still waiting."
"Pretty good, moderately suspenseful book with some twists, though not particularly difficult to figure out.  Liked the writing and the pace, and thought the story hummed along nicely.  Bit of a rip off on Gone Girl, thought I thought that story was much less believable.  I recommend The Girl on the Train as a quick entertaining book."
"Great plot and fast paced reading - perfect for a short weekend or travel read. The ending was a little predictable, which is my reason for knocking down one star. I was hoping for some more surprising plot twists a la Gone Girl. The story almost puttered out toward the end, but managed to wrap everything up into a nice, clean finish, even if it was very predictable."
"Confusing at first, but one has to examine the date and narrator at the head of each chapter, and keep the participants and relationship in mind.  PS:  The movie does an excellent job of capturing the story in 90 minutes!"
This was such a great book! I love murder mysteries and this checked all of my boxes. I couldn't put it down and even listened to it on tape while I was driving to and from work because I was so hooked! Can't wait for the movie!
"This book kept me interested until the very end. I never wanted to put the books down. I like how each chapter is a different person's perspective and is written in first person. Unfortunately the ending was too abrupt left me feeling ""that's it?"". Overall very good quick read."
"A great read.....and never suspected how it would end till close to the end. Not very sympathetic to men at all even though the women have their faults, but they are projected with a more flattering gloss."
"The book was a little hard to 'get into' when I started reading it.  But, once I settled in to the characters and was able to read several pages into the story, it was hard to put down.  Great story with plenty of twists."
"I couldn't put it down! It's the kind of story so close to reality that you become engrossed with it's characters lives. It was difficult to determine what was to come next, it keeps you interested and leaves you in awe, wanting more..."
Pulled me in right from the start. I'd been putting off reading this as I sometimes find that books that people rave about are often disappointing to me. Not this one. Highly recommended. Amazing first book ... I look forward to more from this author.
Wanted to read the book before I saw the movie. I enjoyed it. You keep changing your mind about whether you like a character or not. And she sure spent lots of money riding in the trains and drinking. All in all a good read.
"Couldn't put this down from the beginning.  While the main character's life seems to be unraveling, the book takes you through her story, past and present, to unfold why she is the way she is.  Parallel stories told from the point of view of the other characters weave together to make a suspenseful, well written tale of betrayal, lies, and eventually, murder."
"It is an interesting story told from multiple points of view. I was intrigued, but none of the characters are particularly likable. It is a well written, gritty story."
"I can't believe people actually like this!  This is boring, predictable, and just plain stupid.  There are basically a handful of events that just repeat itself until the writer decides it's enough.  The characters are boring and not likable.  The plot is repetitive.  They are all one dimensional.  I had 5th grade students who write like this.  There is no suspense."
"This book was great! I could not put it down.. The story line really made you wonder about who did what and who was who! There was never a time where I got bored with the book, there was never a time where it was slow... It had me on edge the whole time wondering what was going to happen next.."
"An ""OK"" book, just moved too slowly. I hope the movie is better."
I may have missed it but it seemed to be about a girl with reasonable intelligence and ability who wasn't trying to get her life together.
I picked this book on a whim.  The movie was just released and the previews looked interesting. So glad I did!  This was a well written book and I hated putting it down each night before bed.  Suspenseful...loved it!
Hated this book. BORING. And figured things out about 3/4 of the way through.
"What a train ride, sitting on the edge of your seat.  Great story line, but the beginning of the book is hard to keep track of who is who but stick with it and you will love it.  This was a tough one to figure out who did what to whom but the story grabs hold of you and you just can't put it down.  Buy this one, you won't be sorry."
"I love mysteries but found this story a bit drawn out. The chapters tell the stories from perspective of main female characters. It's a bit far fetched and coincidental. Not my favorite. Also used whisper sync and the narration was British accent which took me ( for some reason) to think of historic story, but reference to Internet and modern technology seemed disjointed."
"I thought that this was an excellent debut novel by Paula Hawkins.  It was an easy, fast, and very entertaining read, and all the while I kept wondering ""who done it"".  There are many twists and turns and at first it was difficult to keep the characters straight.  Not quite as gripping as Gone Girl but very good none the less.  I would highly recommend this."
"Good luck putting this book down once you start it! This is the kind of book where you know something disturbing and dark on the next page but you flip it anyways because you can't stop yourself. 10 out of 10, seriously good!"
The book was ok...a bit predictable...pathetic characters...dismal setting...not quite sure how I really feel.  I guess the storyline was interesting but the main characterwas so sad...but then being an alcoholic is sad.  In fact every character had such a troubled past that you almost  couldn't believe  how they could function at all.  This is also a sad review!!!
"I was a little confused in the beginning sorting through the characters, all written in the I, or first person. It was pretty true to form going down the rabbit hole of alcoholism and the consequences that incur. It was well written. I gave it a four because I was able to figure out the conclusion at the half way mark."
"Good reads have been hit or miss for me lately so The Girl on the Train has been a welcomed hit.  I'll admit, it took a few chapters and a coworkers approval to get me to page turner mode. But the rich characters and plot twists make this book shine.  Easy to see a film in the works here... Let's just leave Affleck out of it..."
I was led to this book by the buzz of the ladies at the book club and the new movie trailer. Good story but it did drag a bit in the beginning. The twist at the end was not as shocking if you paid attention to the bread crumbs.  Solid reading.
"This novel totally lived up to its publicity. What a page Turner. I couldn't wait to resume reading. The author hides the truth until the end of the story. I was looking for hints along the way but she successfully hid them. Three women, all flawed, all unable to escape the men in their lives, at times whining and deplorable, need a twist in plot to save them. Hawkins delivers."
"Great read, unable to put the book down. Constant twists and turns with a very inexpected outcome."
"It took me awhile to figure out that each chapter was a different character talking.  The book is good, I still want to see the movie, even with my 3-star rating.  At some point I got tired of her drinking and forgetfulness."
"What Alfred Hitchcock does with camera pans Paula Hawkins does with words in this psychological thriller of character development. If you were a fan of ""Gone Girl,"" you will be a fan of ""The Girl on the Train."""
"I have not seen the movie, but loved the book.  A real good page turner.  The writing was very interesting - the story told by several of the characters.  I recommend you read this first before watching the movie."
"Initially, I wasn't sure I was going to like this book, it started out very slowly, to me. By the time I was  quarter of the way through, however, I couldn't put it down! Great read, with lots of twists and turns."
"This was a quick, easy read. It is written In 'Gone Girl' fashion with each chapter being told from the main female character's perspective.I enjoyed the story and couldn't figure out who really did it until the final 3 chapters. I totally didn't see the ending coming. It hit me like a girl on a train( see what I did there)"
I had high hopes. Got 119 pages in and had to stop. Not a fan.
"Not one of the characters made you want to like them.  They are all cold, broken, uncaring people.I kept thinking things would unfold to where I'd at least pity any of them; but not to be."
This is just such a brilliant read.  I read this book in two days which is exceptionally fast for me.  Whilst there is a dark side to the main character it was not a depressing read and the book kept me hooked all the way through.  I am looking forward to more books from Paula Hawkins.
"I liked the first 1/2-3/4 much better than the ending.  Writing and plot lines were good in the beginning.By the end I feel the writing fell apart and it got too convoluted to be interesting.Although I liked it, I was dissappointed.  It didn't meet up to all the  hype."
"This novel caught me from the very beginning and I finished it in a day and a half.  The alternating narrative was a little confusing at first, but once I got into the story it didn't matter. I found Paula Hawkins storyline intriguing, compelling, and somewhat depressing, but the ending made up for it. I would highly recommend this book. Enjoy!"
Well written mystery that takes voyeurism to a whole new level.
"Great story! Don't get discouraged if you're not understanding it in the beginning, it gets better. It can be difficult for some people to read from multiple perspectives, but this only makes the story more thrilling."
"Not as great as the reviews I read, but a good read overall.I guessed what the ""surprise"" fact was  early on, but only because of reviewers stating there was one.An interesting view of family function and dysfunction, consequences of poor communication and self-realization coming to fruition.A bit sad, but hopeful story."
Amazing novel that has a fantastic twist.I more appreciated the view in to the kind of an alcoholic than I did the story. Maybe I am not alone? What an incredible insight for those that experience alcoholism first hand or through a relative.
"I'm not sure what to write about this and was unsure of star rating as well. I found it a difficult story to read at times. The characters were mostly unlikable and I felt incredibly frustrated with the main characters lapses in sobriety. However I couldn't wait to find out what happened next, it was an intriguing story with a satisfying conclusion, well for me anyway!"
"At first I thought The Girl on the Train was slow, but then once I got into it the story got more complex.  The story lines changed slowly.  Each character had different layers in their personalities and in their perspectives of reality."
"Loved book. Can't wait for movie, but understand that it is America not London. Looks like from tidbits it's a big White House she is looking at, don't know if I will like that either. Will make judgment after I see the movie."
A daily commuter has a story for a couple that she observes outside the windows of her train. As she watches them she feels that she has come to know them and their backgrounds.A tragedy pulls her into the life of the couple and she feels that she should share what she knows about them to the police. But can she be trusted as a reliable witness?
"None of the characters were sympathetic. I found their actions bizarre and random. There were several red herrings that, if used, could have made the plot more interesting, but alas, this was not to be. This is another ""best seller"" that lacks good writing, thoughtful characters, and a believable plot."
"I expected this to be awesome, and for the first half it was, then it quickly became ""okay"" when things wrap up near the end. Wish I could have rented from the library instead of paying $10 for it."
"Great story with detailed characters. Mystery and twisted love stories at their best. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys a bit of suspense, mystery wrapped in dangerous love."
All the characters were so unlikable. And the plot was slow and then finished up abruptly like the author had a deadline and wanted to move on to her next project. I don't understand why this book is a hit and a motion picture.
"I very much respect that as it becomes apparent who the culprit is, the author does not continue to throw red herrings at the reader, but rather makes it more and more apparent to the reader, even though it is not apparent to the protagonist. This makes the finale of this book a page-turner."
"Just finished reading this book and would highly recommend it for a quick,entertaining read. This  page turner is sure to grab you with a cast of characters that you really can't trust. The author did an extraordinary job of leaving you guessing, with out trying the patience of the reader. If your looking for a summer weekend read. This book is it!"
All three of the female characters seemed the same so I had to keep checking who was speaking quite a few times.  The last few chapters finally picked up and were exciting but seemed to be written by someone other than the author.
I Recommended it and loaned out the book often - I feel like a library.
"While I was over the whole ""blackouts"" I understand it's importance to the story.  I didn't feel hooked at first and I had a bit of trouble feeling connected for the first few chapters.  However I kept going and I'm glad I did.  After I finished reading it I kept thinking about the story and wondering about the ending.  I liked it."
"This book tried too hard to be a twisting mystery.  I got tired of hearing about the main character's drinking problem and the way this all played out ended up being pretty unrealistic.  The story idea was a good one, but I just didn't care for this actual story.  I did give it 3 stars because I did finish it.  If I don't even finish a book it gets a one."
I started reading this book because the movie is supposed to come out soon. It is good but thought that since a movie was being made from it that it would be a lot better. It did have a twist that I wasn't expecting and it did keep me reading from beginning to end.
"While I could not put the damn thing down, I felt manipulated by the story. Very one dimensional characters. For instance, who exactly were the men in the story?"
"Written from different points of view, this was a well written suspenseful, mystery that kept my attention and kept me guessing. Usually the books are better than the movie, so I'm not sure if I will watch the movie."
"I enjoyed this book although it got to a point that the scenes were too repetitive. In other words, the book could have been developed a lot faster to keep the reader more interested in what the outcome would be, which was made evident after reading scene after scene of the same thing with no apparent outcome in sight and no apparent progress made by the police."
It's an awesome read and would recommend this book. I couldn't put it down.
"Fast paced and suspenseful; hard to put down.  Overall, a very enjoyable read.  HOWEVER, the preposterously risky decisions made by the principal characters putting them into danger numerous times really tested the bounds of believability.  I know you're supposed to suspend disbelief when reading fiction but this narrative went way beyond what's reasonable in that regard."
"I am halfway though and loving this book!  Very enthralling right from the get go.  Very clear characters, no issues knowing or remembering who is who.  Very exciting.  Wish I didn't have to put it down."
"The potential was there, but never materialized. With all the hype and the movie, I thought it would be worth my time. Depressing characters, and a drawn out 'simple plot', makes this a book,  I could have done without."
This book was not as great as the hype.  I never connected with any of the characters.  Usually I root for at least one of the people in the book but I could have cared less about any of them.  The storyline dragged and wasn't interesting at all. I only kept reading because I always hoped it would get better but unfortunately it never did.  Don't waste your time.
"Wow!  This really took hold of my attention.  Even when not engaged in reading, it's next page was on my mind and I couldn't wait to get it back in my hands.  Now that Ive completed the novel, I want to reread it to see what little clues I may have missed!"
"For the love of god!!! Rachel is too pathetic for words. I could not get through the book because the characters were so whiney and pitiful. Megan, Rachel, Anna, all of them! Such a waste of money. I couldn't get over how annoyed I was by them. If you want to read about a worthless drunk who is totally consumed by her own self pity this book is for you."
It was a good read but I think the way it was told was a bit odd
I watch this remain on on the best sellers list with a sense that I must have missed something.  Though I finished the book I found it to be very slow moving with a lot of repetition.  At the end I was still waiting for the something to happen.  Compared to other mysteries I've enjoyed this didn't make the grade.
Must read.  So glad a friend suggested it. Helpful Hint:  Keep reading until midway through the book--& then you will NOT want to put it down until the end.  Looking forward to seeing the film--but so glad I read it first!
"The story was intentionally confusing, but the payoff was not really worth the effort.  The writing style was interesting, but it felt almost like a less polished version of ""Memento"".  It's good airport reading."
"I had trouble putting this book down.  At first, it was hard to follow with the different view points, but once I figured out the flow, it was riveting.  It leads you down one road only to push you down another at the end."
I'm feel bad I could not get into this book !!! I used a gift card to buy it now I wish I could send it back. I read all the time and give everything a real try but !!!!!After the first 100 pages I just could not hang  I really really tried
"I literally couldn't stop reading it. No other way to explain it. The author draws you in from the very first chapter, no warming up needed. You can't help but somehow relate (or feel bad for) the main character. I was completely captivated by the story.. going to be hard to find another good read after this one!"
"I was so happy to have a book of over 300 pages to read leisurely.  To my pleasure and surprise I so enjoyed the suspense, writing, plot, that I hardly put it down.  I was able to visualize that it was me on the train, and wondered what I would do in her place, only never to think of how it did end.  Now I need to find another book that I can read leisurely!"
"This book was fantastic!  To be able to weave a story like this with all its twists and turns is just amazing to me.  This book had me so enthralled from the start, I thought about taking a day off from work just so I could keep reading.  Oh, the tangled lives people live!  It's exhausting."
"Good book with a lot of turmoil. A lot of buildup in the middle, but the ending was a little weak in my opinion."
"I love psychological thrillers, as this book is promoted.  I found it neither.  It was slow (ok, I got it -- she is a drunk -- enough already), and a drudgery to get through with a small pay-off."
"Very well written, indeed.  But loses interest as it approaches final, becoming more and more depressing. Two stars for its writing quality, one for originality, three in total. Author has virtues for a better all in all story and I will be waiting for it."
Read this one. It will keep you on your toes while weighing the various options of the meaning of what the girl on the train saw and the tragic events that followed. The protagonist (the girl on the train)  does become something of a busybody while doggedly pursuing a solution to the twisted events that she stumbled upon. The train moves fast and the girl even faster.
"Loved this book and couldn't put it down.  Well drawn characters.  Will be interesting to see how it is transferred to film.  So glad I read the book first, as have made firm images in my head!  An easy but gripping read."
"Loved the story. I could not put this book down. At one time, I was commuting by train and I can remember looking out the window at the houses along the track and thinking about what is this person's story, or what is that family's life like. My only issue is that the ending was not at climatic as I would like, but I would like to read more from this author."
Rachel rides the train every morning and evening and when it stops at a signal she sees a couple and attaches an imaginary life for them. Little does she know that she couldn't be more wrong. She would soon find out the truth.
"This has been the best book I've read in a while! She weaves suspense and intrigue into the story so well. Several times I thought I had a hint of what was happening, only to find out that no- something else had been planned. Loved it."
"If you liked gone girl, this book is for you. It really keeps you guessing. I loved that the main character, actually all of the narrators, aren't very likable. I wasn't really rooting for a home.Basically, a woman on a train looks into the window of a house near where the Train slows everyday. Then, one day, the woman there disappears. What happened to the woman? But it twists and lays out a slew of characters that keep you guessing which one you think is behind it, and even more? Who do you wish it were?"
"Really enjoyed this book - it's the first I've read from Paula Hawkins and could not put it down. I like the way it's narrated in the first person for the various characters, so it switches throughout the book. Keeps it interesting and gives you an in-depth feel for each character."
Loved it -- The suspense and the flawed characters in this book.  Would recommended to anyone that enjoys a bit of mystery-when you think you know the villain and then there is a twist.  Can't wait to discuss with my group.
"I was surprised by how much I liked this novel. Very strange in the beginning, going back and forth. However, the more I read, the more I was pulled in. Scott was a complete jerk, but so was Megan. Rachel is just a poor lost soul. Anna, although I didn't like her, at least came through. The only character I felt was okay was the psychiatrist. Wouldn't really recommend"
I almost didn't get this book because of the negative reviews but if you stick with it you'll enjoy it as I did. None of the three main characters (who are telling the story) are particularly likeable but they do have a very dark tale to tell and  you can't help but be pulled into it and want see it to the end. Some surprises here and it did take a bit longer than usual to figure out who-done-it. The ending was improbable but I don't think too implausible. Gove it a try.
"Recommended by a friend and having seen it all over book stores etc, I figured I'd give this book a try.  It seemed a little hard to get into but having persevered it is sustaining my interest but I would not call it a page turner.  Both the violence and the sexual content are inferred not in your face.  It is just somewhat a contorted story seemingly just because."
"A clever who-done-it story that I found myself picking up every time I had a spare minute or two to read.  I really enjoyed the author writing from the perspective of the different characters, and that this story stayed on the story line and didn't wander around and add a lot of filler that can sometimes be added unnecessarily to make a book longer than it needs to be."
"I found this rather contrived and ultimately tedious.... far too far fetched to be even the slightest believable.. Also remindedd me of the film Lost in Ls Vegas  for all the wrong reasons,where the depicted alcoholism of Nicholas Cage is farcical as is the protagonists alcoholism here.. If I were you I'd give this one a miss. Can't believe it's on the best seller's lists.. People in general must like junk !!!!"
"This book was just ok. It introduces several storylines and characters that serve absolutely no purpose other than to try and confuse you and throw you off from guessing who the killer is, who turns out to be exactly who you thought it was from the start. I also do not like a book where the killer confesses all in the last few pages because he/she thinks they're going to get away with it, which is what happens here.  Very unrealistic. It was a quick read and Id recommend it to people telling them it was just ok."
The ending was the best part... If you can make it to the end through the long back and forth readings. It reminded me a lot of the book Gone Girl. It's worth the read but I like a page turner and his just wasn't that for me until the ending .
Somehow this book wasn't the story I was expecting and maybe that's one of the reason's I like it so much.  The writing is simple and clear with the story primarily following the main character and her travels and reveries.  The story moves steadily toward the climax and is a thriller.
"I rarely don't finish a book I have started, but I left this at half way. It got very tedious. Although an interesting plot, it just seems to go on and on, without being compelling.  Surprised to find it such a best seller."
"I enjoyed ""The Girl on the Train"" very much. It kept my interest, and as a divorcee I could relate to the sadness Rachael felt. I found myself continually trying to guess who, how, and way in this ""who done it"" mystery love story. Very well written and great character studies. I highly recommend this book. :)"
"I've heard this book compared to ""Gone Girl"". I resisted reading it for so long because of that. It is much better in my view. I found the lead character, Rachel, to be very complex.  The ending was not what I expected at all.  I can't stand books that are predictable and this definitely was not."
"I see this book has gotten some poor reviews, but I, for one, loved it!  I appreciated getting into the mind and imagination of the girl on the train - living herr thoughts and struggles.  And I was kept guessing about who the actual villain was - or if there actually was one!  It was a great read for me and I hope they turn it into a movie."
"I enjoyed reading it, couldn't put it down and anxiously waited to find down time to read it again! There are lots of twists and having three different narrators kept you on your toes. As another reviewer mentioned, it had a similar twist to 'Gone Girl'. If you enjoyed that book you'll love this one as well. I can't wait to watch the movie!!"
"This book easily gets five stars. The story is told from the point of view of three women, the central figure being Rachel. The three stories weave around one another growing close and closer with nice twists and turns, but without deus ex machina artifice, and gradually blend. It is true page turner which I highly recommend. I hope this author gives us some more."
"Great read, at first it was a bit confusing going back and fourth between characters, but then it started to be super intriguing and I couldn't put it down! Loved it."
"I gave it 4 stars because I only give 5 to thw ones I would read again . However,  I would watch the movie.  I thought the book was chilling, mysterious,  & surprising.  The plot reminded me of the story Gone Girl"
"Two abusive men, three unstable women.. what's to like about it..  much hype some really unlikeable people.."
It was a good book.  I read it steadily in about 2 weeks.  The author was more interested in the story than the characters so the story was exciting enough but it was difficult to care about any of the three women.
"I can see people wanting to call this THIS YEAR'S GONE GIRL, and this would be somewhat apt. Unreliable narrator. Inventive, circuitous narration. Flawed, even unlikable, characters.  It seems not as strong as Flynn's book in its ambition, but better in the sense that you don't feel like you need a shower afterwards to wash the characters off of you."
"I read it in less then 4 days.  I really enjoyed the women, all written from their own points of view.  All of them damaged and dark in their own way. I couldn't help but see parts of myself in all three."
I love a book that  keeps me in suspense up until the end <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00B3>
Long winded piece of boring rubbish.Dragged on and on
"This book had a grip on me from the second I picked it up, I loved how it was written in the views between all the different characters. The twists and turns just a great read, definitely recommend it!"
"I really enjoyed the book - it does have a sort of 'Gone Girl' feel, but I liked that book too.  I think the characters are interesting and although I did figure out a portion of the ending, I had to keep reading to see if I was correct.  This was a book club read and I think there is plenty to discuss at our meeting."
"Not able to pinpoint why, but this book just did not hold my attention. I think the life of a woman with a drinking problem and depression just did not interest me. As in real life, the self absorption of the alcoholic is boring."
"This novel , although very well written, is very upsetting.  The agony of the main character, not knowing if what she remembers is true or not, can cause some anxiety in the reader. Nevertheless, I recommend it."
"I was riveted through most of the book, good prose, sardonic humor, really clever and I thought the character of Rachel was very well developed.  The situation seemed absurd, yet believable, which was what i really loved about it.  Unfortunately, for me, the ending was a little pat.  I didn't think it needed all that violence and I would have liked a more complicated ending for Rachel.  But, still, I would recommend it and have."
"As someone with an active imagination and who used to commute by train into the big city daily, I could relate to the protagonist's obsession with wondering about lives of the inhabitants of the homes along the route. Hawkins imagination did not disappoint. Each  character with her or his egocentric imperfections and expectations made the story entirely believeable."
Although it did get a bit old try to remember through an alcoholics memory. I guessed the killer long before Rachel pieced it together. Her unraveling of the story was slow and tedious at times. I'm not quite sure I would compare this book with Gone Girl as that story blew me away with the shear attention to detail. But this story was griping in its own right. I do have to say that I hated Anna but found the ending very satisfying. It was a quick read and I would recommend it for what it is.
"After reading so many positive reviews, I purchased The Girl on the Train.  Big mistake!  Miserable main character living a miserable life equals a miserable book. And the other characters weren't any better.  Always an optimist, I kept reading it hoping it would get better but by the time I got to the end, I didn't really care who did what to whom.  (Apologies to the author.)"
"The author has a way of making you feel like the main characters lives could happen to anyone.I couldn't tell if Rachel was crazy or everyone else was.In typical whodunnit tradition, it's someone you know well."
"The Girl On The Train was a nice beach read. I had high expectations when I heard Stephen King gave it glowing reviews. I didn't LOVE it, but it did interest me enough to read it in about two days. I do like the current trend of flawed main characters, and it did keep me guessing until the end. I would recommend it to anyone who is into the ""Gone Girl"" genre."
"Superb writing. Usually, I don't enjoy novels written as various characters' perspectives. However, this was done with such excellence that it was so very easy to follow and to get into the minds of the different characters. Enjoyed it immensely!"
"It took me longer than usual to get through this book, but I was determined to get through it.  Several times, when I had to stop reading and didn't get back to it for a few days, I had to backtrack to see who the chapter was about because I just couldn't pick up where I had left off.  The good part, I didn't figure out who did it till just before it was revealed."
"An absolute marvel. Written perfectly and kept me guessing all the way through. The plot, twists, characters, settings, all perfect and unique and eerily believable. A definite read! Thank you Paula Hawkins."
"A great read. Moves along fast and was done and dusted in two days. The main character is a little annoying in that the author has her tackling dangerous situations on her own and she often is interfering and quite frankly, simple-minded in her relationships.  Despite this, the irritation did not stop any enjoyment of the story and there was another stronger female character there to redeem the first."
"This was a great read, finished in a couple days as it really kept my attention. It felt a bit obvious but it was still enjoyable."
"I expected an amazing book. It was a good quick read. I was let down after all the reviews I heard. I'm sure it will be made it another bad movie like Gone Girl. But! Read it, forget what u have heard. Good little mystery."
Boring and confusing.  I understand the movie is much better.
"Really enjoyed this book, especially the way the author played with time.  I thought the arc of the villain was a little too quick, which made the ending somewhat predictable, but overall, I totally enjoyed this book."
"Awesome book. I couldn't put the book down. I actually finished it in just 2 days. It kept me so interested, but the biggest surprise came at the end....when the book was over. Loved every minute of this book."
I love the story-telling style of the book.  The shifting point of point was excellent.  But the characters were not people you could feel invested in.  ...and I correctly guessed the murderer even before halfway through.
An excellent read.  Takes a little bit at the beginning to figure out the characters and timeline but the stage is perfectly set.Very hard to put down and a compelling read right to the last word.
I heard great reviews on cbs what a great book to read. I bought it and was very excited. I kept thinking thinking it would get better but instead worse. I hated that I spent 10.00 for it. I would not recommend it to anyone.
"It was an enjoyable book to read.  At first, I had little sympathy for the main character.  She seemed to be the type to bring about her own misfortune.  However, as I read further, it held my interest and progressed to a very interesting novel.  Good character development and plot twists."
"This book is written from the point of view of 3 different women and goes back and forth on timing, if that annoys you then you might not enjoy this. I typically don't like that but I loved this book. Can't wait for the movie"
"I only read part of this book, because I found the perceptions of this disfunctional young woman boring and irritating.  She just went on and on about nothing but her own miserable existence and a need to imagine the lives of others.  I do not want to hear about the woes of losers who have the brains to do well and support themselves."
"This ""murder mystery"" was made more interesting by the rich descriptions of the location (west London) and homes.  It was  also interesting to read chapters where each character spoke from the first person perspective."
"It took some getting used to, going forward and backwards in time. Once you start to make your own conclusions, it's hard to stop reading! And the actual conclusion is not what you expect, which to me is the best part!"
"This was a recommendation to my book club as a great mystery. I found it slow, dull and boring, and thought I was the only one, until our book club get together. None of us could understand why it's such a best seller. I had a hard time slogging through to the finish and felt somewhat vindicated that others felt the same way."
I was involved and interested with the book but I was never truly hooked. It was interesting and thought provoking at times. It's a pretty good book with insight into the mind of a male sociopath. I like how it was realistic in that way but the numerous alcoholic blackouts from the main narrator make it hard to believe. Not bad and not great.
It was okay but I have read much better books this year.  It is a quick summer read.  I found the characters not to be very believable which was part of my problem with this book.  I almost didn't finish it to be frank because I didn't really care what happened and had pretty much figured it out well before the author gets to the ending.
The story has a lot about character interaction- it was a bit heavy on the emotional relationship side... The book takes a while to develop the complex characters and by the time all these complexities were added up... i stopped reading.
"I've been meaning to pick up this book for a while now. My boyfriend bought me a kindle for Christmas and I finished this book in 5 days. It's exciting and suspenseful, it keeps you thinking of what is really going on with the characters all the way through. Would definitely recommend!"
very nice book with a well written easy to read. a surprising events and you will not understand until you finish the book. every single corner of this novel contain a story. waiting to see the movie.
"Poor Rachel.  No one believes what she says because she has become an alcoholic.  No one likes her because she has become an alcoholic.  When a woman she has watched from the train disappears, she gets involved, to everyone's dismay.  Good book.  Hard to put down."
"This book was a big disappointment to me.  I had trouble keeping track of which character was speaking.  The main plot seemed to tell about a girl who drank so much that she lost a bit more of herself with each day.  She may have witnessed a murder, and seemed compelled to solve it, which was futile because her memory was so impaired.  Sadly, I gave up after wading through about 60% of the book. (I know, the plot finally gets to the point, and I quit too soon!). Sorry to have wasted my time on this mess."
"I liked the way the author made a complex story out of a mundane action like riding the commuter train everyday. Many times when I'm driving to work I look at people's houses and imagine what their lives might be like and know that I could not be further from their reality. This story bears that out and illustrates how little we truly know about our friends and loved ones, let alone strangers we pass on the train or in a car. I was surprised at every turn and could not put this book down."
"Unputdownable thriller that plays severely on one's emotions! No-one could be as stupid, we think, as the main character, Rachel.  But that's the draw the author uses to retain one's interest. Great read!"
"I thought this was an excellent read!  It's written from several characters points of view, which in the Kindle version are a little faded and hard to read so I was a little confused the first few chapters.  But the story kept me going and by halfway through I couldn't put it down because I was anxious to see how it would pan out."
"I found the heroine, well she's not that,I should say the protagonist hard to love at first but the story drew you in and I was on edge waiting to see what she would do and what would happen next. So if you should be skeptical reading the first couple of chapters trust me you'll get drawn into this  ""nothing is really as it seems"" mystery story. I'm not going to drop any more ""spoilers"", I may have said too much already, but bottom line, I thought it was definitely worth the read."
"i liked the book. glimpse to the moods and every day struggle of alcohol addicted girl whom u can understand and symphatise with.  vivid picture of gray days and moving trains stayed with me long after i finish the book. the plot is good, the last part when everything is clear is a bit long, but all by all a very good aftertaste."
"A good murder mystery with an absence of any likable characters. Some you feel sorry for, some deserve what they get, but all are interesting. The lead character Rachel, is a pathetic heroine. While I found myself rooting for her, it was more because of the awful characters surrounding her, than anything redeemable about her. I liked the chapters written from each characters perspective."
The Girl On the Train found me comparing it to Alfred Hitchcock's 'Rear Window' and 'Sleeping With the Enemy'.  It was a good book kept me reading into the early hours.  I understand it's going to be made into a movie .  It should be very successful.
"The book was a very fast read.  But it is not well written and has kind of a trite story line.  If I were the publisher and it were my first effort, I probably wouldn't have bothered publishing it.  The good part was the fact that it could be read vert quickly and did keep your interest.  It certainly doesn't come anywhere near the caliber of writing of a Stephen King, a Harlen Coben, a John Sanford or a Jeffery Deaver. And it certainly should not be compared with ""Gone Girl"" which was written very well."
OMG! I could not put it down! Can't wait for the movie. Do yourself a favor and DON'T look at the cast for the movie. I did that half way through and it sort of changed my perspective for the characters.
"It seems like people either love or hate this book. I really liked it. I stayed up way too late several nights this week because I couldn't put it down. It reminded me of Gone Girl. There were some parts at the end that felt a little ridiculous, but I never found it boring like some people said."
Began reading and was hooked only a few pages in! Couldn't put it down unless I had too! Amazingly written you can truly feel the characters emotions! Highly recommended!
"This is an ingenious story, told through the first person viewpoint of 3 different characters-- Rachel, Anna and Megan.  Rachel is the alcoholic ex-wife of Anna's current husband.  Megan is a neighbor of Anna, and the person who Rachel looks for every day her train passes Megan's house.  Megan disappears.  The mystery unfolds slowly and comes to an exciting conclusion."
"It was a little hard getting into the plot at the beginning of the book with different characters talking first person, some with both fictional and real names.  It was a suspense clear to the very end."
"The beginning of the book was awesome. I was hooked, but as the plot started to untwist I lost a little interest. I still finished it through but felt it went a little too ""lifetime movie"" for my taste."
Girl on the Train seemed slow in plot development.  Having each chapter narrated by a different character and not sequential in time may have contributed to this.  Was interesting to follow the main character's train of thought.
"Great writing from the get go - not a huge spectrum of challenging vocabulary or impressive  structural talent, but quite interesting play on time, the mind and perspectives. Page turner from the start."
Lets just say I was pretty sure I knew what was happening and I loved that I was wrong! I will admit at the beginning I almost put this down. The main character just seemed like a loser. I was so glad I kept reading because it was a good read and I really ended up liking the characters and the surprise at the end was the best part.
"I expected this to be a mystery, and it is, sort of--but it's more the gradual revelation of how the characters propel themselves and each other into sad and violent collisions.  Trains play their supporting roles--and much of what happens feels a lot like I imagine it might be like to watch an impending train wreck that you are powerless to stop."
"It was a fairly entertaining book; I had seen a lot of hype so I had high expectations, and it was a little disappointing in that regard.  I would recommend it as a solid read, but It wasn't as ground breaking as some make it out to be."
"When I first started to read it I was very confused by the different names in the different chapters. I quit reading it. Then I picked it up again and couldn't stop reading. This book is much better than Gone GirlI did get a tiny clue near the end of the book and figured out who it was, but I would recommend reading it."
"It was something to read, but was it worthy of 4 or 5 stars? Not really. It's hard to truly enjoy a story full of loathsome characters and really, only 1 minor character in the entire book was likable. If you're bored and desperate, give it a go."
"Definitely entertaining and quick. But I don't like how the author tries to falsely lead you to think things when the truth is already obvious...just gets annoying. Also, the main character is really deplorable and incredible...always kind a downside to a book! It's like a dumbed down version of Gone Girl, which was really masterfully written! But it was a nice, easy read for before bed."
"The story begins when you meet Rachel (the girl on the train). She rides the train to an imaginary job everyday so that no one knows she has been fired. Since her divorce, she has begun drinking to the point that it clouds her memories and controls her thoughts. What is real and what is not?  As the plot develops through the eyes of the main characters, you learn that a murder has been committed. Only in the end will you discover the truth about Rachel, her memories, and the real killer. A good read!"
My friends raved about this book and I couldn't wait to read it. I think their accolades were overly enthusiastic. The three main characters were so whiney. Each one wallowed in self-pity. I enjoy reading mysteries and I like authors who can build the suspense until the last few days. This book held no surprises and I was able to figure out the villain before the book was half over.  Most readers will not agree with my assessment of Hawkins book but I doubt I will read another of her novels.
I didn't finish the book. It took too long to get to the point. It was part of a book club I am with. The book is all over the place and I guess it ties up at the end. I was really looking forward to reading it but...
Wow when I got to the end of this book I was left liked wow…WTF. I was left wanted something more for Rachel after all she had been through but I was glad to have been able to get some closure for her. I enjoyed how we got bits and pieces that made the story come together. I will admit there was times I was biased towards one character but in the end I was able to get past that and really enjoy the story without letting my feelings get the best of me. This was a fun book club read that I enjoyed discussing.
"There is a great reason this book has captured so much attention. The author catches your interest at the beginning and does not let go. In fact, as I pick this book up to review it, I want to read it again. The book has been called a literary mystery, but it is far more. Men and women alike will find much in this book to think about with respect to the undercurrents hidden beneath the surface of seemingly peaceable matrimonial unions."
"I struggled to get into this book until the very end, as the shifting between narrators made it more difficult to dig into what any one person was saying/thinking. But there were a lot of interesting turns and twists, and the end was very exciting. So it was an enjoyable read, particularly for a book club book, but not great enough that I didn't wish I was reading the book I was reading on my own until the very end."
"Entertaining novel throughout the entire read. I liked some of the readers better than others. The fun part was there were three readers, so that's not a large complaint. It took me almost until the end of the book to solve the mystery which made me listen for more extended periods of time. (I listened to it on Audible) I would give this book 4.5 stars if that was available. Well worth your credits."
This book captured my attention from the start. The plot developed from the perspective of three individuals shows the deception of what we think or hope versus what's reality. The personality of each character portrays the human condition. It's a thriller to the end.
Couldn't put this book down.  Started it one day finished it the next.  I will say I was pretty confident I knew who did it fairly early into the read but it didn't take away for the enjoyment of reading the book or the learning all the details of why they did what they did.
"It was an interesting read, but I am not a fan of novels narrated by alternating characters and alternating time periods.  Reading it on my Kindle, I have to highlight each chapter title to be able to go back and identify who and when I am dealing with. My book club was split on it between 3 and 5 stars."
"I read the book in record time, couldn't put it down so to speak.  The characters are so real. Rachel is a mess, she has hit rock bottom in her life and during the first pages I wonder what could ever happen to improve things.  Read the story."
"There are a lot of reviews on this book touting it's twists and comparing it to Gone Girl. This book does not live up to the hype. It's a fairly straightforward mystery/thriller that relies on its ""big"" twist at the end. It's fine, but certainly not in the same class of edge-of-your-seat ""oh my god"" thrillers as Gone Girl."
I haven't been able to get very far into this book. I can't seem to stay interested long enough to get to where I assume the more interesting stuff is - I am assuming because this book had a lot of good reviews. The main character is so very unlikable and tiresome it's a real turn off. Bummed because I was looking forward to a great read.
"It was a real page turner, and I hope the movie is good as well.  Makes you think if you really know yourself and can you trust yourself.  Are your doubts really you, or what people have put upon you?  Also makes you think twice about drinking and even thinking about your ex."
"I found at the beginning of ""The Girl on the Train"" was ""what book is this""  I thought it would take me weeks to read because it seemed like  a book that I would either stop reading or fall asleep reading.  Anyhow as I read it got better and better.  I finished in 2 days.  I ended up enjoying it."
"A real page turner in the manner of ""Gone Girl.""  Enjoyed the psychological insights to those afflicted to alcoholism and unrequited love. I also enjoyed the England-English (as opposed to American-English). ex: ""Would you like A coffee?"" instead of ""Would you like coffee?"" Kept me on my toes looking for these little nuances. :)"
"Only read it because it was labeled as the next ""Gone Girl"". I thought it was veeery predictable. I kept waiting for a ""twist"" but it never came. I will see the movie, hopefully it's better."
"To the author - thank you for writing this wonderful book!  Fascinating how flawlessly the story is ""told"" by three different characters, Rachel, Meghan, Anna, while switching from present to past and vice versa."
"Because of all the hype, I guess I was disappointed.  I had it figured out in the first chapter. Not sure why it is a huge hit but basically, I would advise against buying this book if you read a lot. If you're the kind of person who only picks up a book once a year to hit the beach with, then you might like this book. Otherwise, pass on it."
"I'm not sure why this book is getting so much buzz! It honestly reads like someone wrote a suspense novel, then Gone Girl came out and had tons of hype, then the publisher of this book told the author to go back and make it more like GG. I just didn't find it interesting and the theme was just sort of played out. I wouldn't recommend it."
There is no comparison to Gone Girl except that it takes forever for the book to get started. These characters are all ridiculously sad and shallow. It was also very predictable. There was no suspense at all.
"The story line was somewhat predictable.  Many story lines that were surface, but never really fully developed.  Main character had drinking problem that created black outs, yet some sort of came back, but only in pieces.  Left a lot of loose ends dangling.  weird ending."
"I enjoyed this book.  It kept my interest throughout the book.  I wanted to know from chapter to chapter what would happen next.  The characters, their actions, and their back stories were interesting and played I to the plot in an intriguing way."
The author has the main character do some pretty ridiculous and pathetic things. Almost unbelievable. Will probably make for a better movie when its more acceptable to do stupid s*** for dramatic effect.
"Hackneyed writer, ridiculous plot, indistinguishable and equally unpleasant characters. One of the worst books I have ever forced myself to finish, which was only because it was a book club selection."
"A great summer read. Suspense from beginning to end. A really unique perspective seeing something from the train and then collecting facts to make sense out of it. How tormenting doubt can be. Add a touch of alcohol, and you really start wondering what you have seen and whether or not the sense you make of reality really makes sense."
"Wow, this was gripping. Loved the way the viewpoint shifted between Rachel, Anna and Megan. Well written.  All the characters were flawed in interesting ways....a drunk, a narcissistic other woman turned wife, a sex crazed guilt ridden wife trapped in a marriage.  I did not even begin to guess who committed the murder until shortly before it was revealed.  Well done!"
"An interesting tale of a woman who sees her old neighborhood from a train which she rides daily.  She observes an occurrence that sparks her imagination and adds to her drinking problem. The three narrators share things in common and one is kept guessing as to the perceptions and realities of each of them.  There is adultery and marital conflict and  mistakes in observations.  The resolution is interesting and although not unexpected, not entirely foreseen either.."
"Good mystery on who actually committed the murder of Megan. You keep hoping Rachel will remember her ""blackout periods"". You feel that she has a definite clue as to who committed the murder! She struggles with her drinking - the ""right"" thing to do and what makes her ""feel better"""
"It was not a predictable story and had a number of twists; this is what kept me reading the book.  I did not find the characters relatable or realistic. The alcoholism, the severe loss as a young girl and the self-interest of the three main women in the story are difficult to accept as believable past problems.  All the characters felt overly traumatized in relation to their pasts."
"Not my favorite book, but it wasn't the worst read ever. I wasn't a fan of the story line and didn't really like the characters but I had to finish it. I wasn't really thrilled with the ending either. Overall decent but  I wouldn't recommend it."
"So often one reads that a ""book"" keeps them up all night, and when you read that ""book"" you do not stay up all night. Well, this book did keep me up all night.  From the first page you are mesmerized and keep trying to figure out the outcome.  It was one of the best books that I have read in a long time and the characters came alive."
Great read. Sucks you in and takes you on a ride. My daughter and I read it over the holidays and loved discussing the fascinating characters and different perspectives. Had to stay with it until the end when it all comes together and the mysteries are elucidated. Loved it.
"thought it would be an interesting perspective of a young gal who has to ride the train to better herself rather than the alcoholic who rides the train to drink ......yes, its a narrative of someone is the downward spiral of drinking but that was soooooo not what i was thinking it would be ....i was hoping for an introspective of an anonymous person on a train rather than someone who needs AA!"
"This is real interesting who-done-it.  Knowing London fairly well,  I could almost visualize the train rides and what it like to ride along and see into peoples yards and houses.  Enjoyed it very much."
"All of a sudden I have been hearing about this book. Where have I been? Everyone recommending it, where ever I go. They are right...read it in a weekend...could not put it down. If you are skeptical, not hesitate any longer."
"I thought this novel was good, and it did engage my interest, but I also felt it was a bit like GONE GIRL because so many of the characters were emotional train-wrecks. (Sorry for the bad pun there.)  It certainly is a thriller, and it was hard to put down and really tough to predict the ending.  I cannot say that I found any of the characters sympathetic though - they were all so flawed, but I suppose that is not too far from reality."
Oh! I just could not continue reading this poor woman's story. The blackouts she kept having and the mix of characters and time lines gave me a headache. Sorry y'all I don't know what the hype was all about. Half way through I stopped caring who really had killed who.
Loved the way story flowed between characters and the suspense that built up towards the end. Keeps you thinking all the way through. A must read if you want to be enthralled .  Book that is very hard to put down
"I enjoyed reading this book, although I didn't really like any of the characters. It was still an interesting story, told in an easy to read way. It hooked me in from the beginning as I read about one trainwreck after another until it revealed an interesting end."
"I don't think I've ever been so tired of a character as I was of Rachel, the woman who rode trains.  Her emotions ran the gamut from A to B - exhaustion, confusion, weakness. (Make that A to C.)  By the middle of the book, I wished someone would shake her.  And they did, regularly.The writing wasn't bad, the plotting wasn't bad, but there were no characters I sympathized with.  By the end, I was ready for the whole cast to disappear.If you read this book, be ready for an unbelievable conclusion."
"Honestly, I'm struggling to get through this book (3/4 through now so I'm not done). I'm plugging along because that is what I do with books that have been recommended and I've spent money on. I don't care for the characters. They don't engage me. It doesn't thrill me. I don't know London and can't relate. Overall it's just BLAH. Going to complete it though just to find out about the missing woman..."
"I wish we could give half stars because I would give this 3.5 I was disappointed in this book. I appreciated the plot twists but sadly, the language was ordinary. This book was certainly no ""Gone, Girl."" I guess I was taken in by all the buzz. Nicely put together but the characters left me cold, despite the fact that they were unlikeable (my weakness). Train metaphor overdone and annoying but a good read nonetheless."
"I can't understand why this book is considered  one of the best books of the year, it is badly written and quite frankly a lousy story."
Tedious and predictable story. I figured out who the bad guy was about half way through the book. I can't understand the great reviews.
Not sure why this stays on the best seller list was not impressed didn't find it thrilling at all. I thought this was very predictable.
The shifting of characters confused me in the beginning and I had to reread the first few chapters but midway through it came together.
"I would actually give it 3 1/2 stars, if that was an option. It was good, but some aspects were a bit hard to believe.  Toward the middle of the book I started thinking that it could be a good thriller movie as it reminded me of Sleeping with the Enemy."
"Overall, This book was simply OK. The main character, Rachel, was enough to make you want to scream. I can't imagine someone being as dim witted as this one. If you have the chance to read this book free of charge, give it a try. Definitely not worth the $10 I paid for it though."
"I had a really hard time with this book. The switch between the characters at difficult time lines was my problem. I ended up making notes on what character was doing what and at what time. When I finally finished the book I decided it was not worth the read. Maybe if I read it again I'd like it better, but I can't get the original reading hours back and don't want to invest any more. Maybe the ladies liked it better. It has great ratings so a lot of people obviously like it, just not me."
"Not the usual genre I read but I enjoyed this book! The story kept me very engaged and I  cared ""who done it""!  Several scenarios were plausible! The concept was original. The narrative alternated between three of the main characters and the things were tied up at the end.  The writing style was perfect for the story.  Some characters were  better developed than others and  some plot details were a little shaky but overall, this was a fun read."
"I really enjoyed this book - had a hard time putting it down.  I agree with other reviewers that ending was dissatisfying. I won't spoil anything (hate that about reviews) but will say that ending was just a little drawn out for my liking. I really hated the Anna character and could not fathom how any human could behave like she did at the end. However, the story really drew me in and the sad life of the main character was troubling but yet I'm sure there are people out there whose lives are very similar."
"Good grief!!  By the time I got to the end of this novel, I was thoroughly exhausted.  While the book provides interesting insights into the life of an alcoholic, and the lives of those around them, it failed to me to be a psychological thriller as touted. I wanted to shake the heroine and tell her to get a grip on her life.  For my money, the book could have been pages shorter.  I frankly was tired of riding the train by the time I got to the end of the book.  However, realization and coming to one's senses is always refreshing as is having another shot at life.  in this way, the book did indeed redeem itself."
So many reviews - that should tell you that you should read this book.  I suppose how you feel about this book will depend on the experiences you have had n your life.  It is so worth the read.  But be warned.  It is not one you will put down and forget.  It is just that good.
"All is not what it appears to be.  The twists and turns in the lives of Rachel, Megan and Anna drew me in to the storyline.  Trying to decide among suspects and possible perpetrators made it a challenging read.  I found some repetition annoying, but possibly it was necessary to its conclusion."
This woman endures more than is expected by any means. She has lived and lost. Becomes engulfed in sadness and addiction only to be part of a tragedy that is out of her control. A good read that is hard to put down because you feel for the character and only want her to put herself back together and be safe.
"I belong to a book club and this book was chosen for the month of March. I think that overall it was an okay book. I think that it left a lot of things out that should have been added about certain characters. Not a bad read, but left you wanting more."
"Extremely complicated to follow the first 25% or more b/c of dates used, ""morning,"" ""evening,"" and characters' names as chapter headings.  Didn't care for the way it was written at all.  Almost stopped reading it at that point.Then about 60% of the way thru I finally got interested.  About 80% of the way thru I figured the whole thing out.  Some suspense, but nowhere near that of Gone Girl.  I understand the high ratings some people have given but I guess I have higher expectations."
"Wow!  This story captivated me.  Like Rachel, I didn't know who to trust, and what to believe.  I found myself suspecting everyone, except her flat mate of being the killer.  I began to realize, toward the end, as more and more details emerged, who might have done it, yet I could not be certain til the end.  A validating twist at the end.  Thank you for such an incredible ""who done it!"""
"This book is slow to start and from the beginning you question why it was on the best seller list for so long.  The main characters are depressing and seem to never truly develop for the reader.  Although the last third of the book starts to pick up, it was not worth the wait.  Unless you have nothing else available, I would look for another book to read."
"Good book, well written. Story line is good. I heard a lot of hype about this book, all over social media, from friends, etc. I expected the book to be awesome and was slightly disappointed due to everyone talking it up. Still enjoyed the read!"
"While I might normally give this book 4 stars, I'm giving an extra star due to the well-developed characters. The author has the courage to delve to the darkest places of people, in all characters. It is in that darkness that even a small flicker of light can be seen and even nourished. A great mystery read with strong and interesting female characters. Highly recommended."
"Great read, with lots of twists and turns. I was pleasantly surprised that the ending was not predictable. If you like a mystery you will enjoy this book. Definitely 5 stars for keeping the interest throughout. I am looking forward to more of her books to add to my reading list."
"I really enjoyed this book from start to finish but I wouldn't compare it to Gone Girl. It's a great read and I found myself eager to get back to it. I wish there had been less hype about this book because I think I was expecting more. If I hadn't read all the hype I would have found it to be a good book but since my expectations were raised, I was a bit disappointed with the ending. Still, an excellent read and one I would recommend."
"After I figured out the different characters, it was a page turner! I couldn't put it down! The author really draws you in with the activities of everyday life - riding the train, going through the station, walking the streets. These things that are so familiar made it feel so real."
"II can only rate what I read as I did not complete the book.  Personally, I thought itwas difficult to follow.  The characters were always vague and strange - hard to know who was who - what was realand what wasn't.  A dreamlike book - i prefer more down to earth characters and realistic circumstances.  ."
I read a lot of mysteries but apparently not so much this style. I found it creepy as I read but I couldn't quit reading till the end. It was very well structured and written. I kept wondering how it could be made into a movie because it would be great! Sort of a British Gone Girl with peeks into private lives and twists and turns. I still think about it!
"This book was an insult to the intelligence of the reader. Poorly developed characters, many of whom with mental health issues, drag on in a story line that could be good but, is not.  The plausibility of the events is outrageous and depressing.  Skip this corkscrew of a novel."
"I enjoyed this book very much. It just flowed along, it was almost like someone was telling you a story. i will be checking out more books by Paula Hawkins. I was totally surprised at the ending !!"
It was a very good book.  The only thing I didn't like was the way that it went back and forth between characters which was in the beginning hard to follow.  Great story line and unexpected ending.
"Slow start but very easy to put yourself in the character's world. The storyline is narrated through three different women, but it all comes together nicely. Must keep going....the end is worth it."
"Good fast paced thriller. Paula did a good job in keeping you guessing as to who the actual killer was. Gave it four out of five stars only because the general plot is a bit unoriginal. Like ""Sleeping with the enemy"" and ""Fatal attraction"" (to name a couple) you reach a point where the outcome is obvious. Well done though. Better than most thrillers I've read."
"It's been quite some time since a book grabbed me and wouldn't let go. I was carried away by Rachel and Megan and HAD to know what really happened. Between Audible and the whispersync feature of the kindle book, i just spent the last two days, whenever i got a moment, trying to finish the story. An amazing read you will not soon forget!"
"It was a depressing book and I only kept on reading it because so many people had recommended it.  Only the last 10% was intriguing.  Otherwise, a downer book about a depressed, manipulated, delusional woman."
"The story is presented from the perspective of three different women.  Even with the changing perspective, the story moves along beautifully in a continuous flow.  I liked how the suspense built gradually and kept the reader guessing about the outcome.  I very much enjoyed the book.  As always, wished it was longer."
Holds your attention throughout the entire book. You are rooting for things to work out well for the young woman on the train and you just don't know till the end who actually committed the crime. It's very good.
"The book is good, however at times confusing. It does get you thinking on which character did what and how they connect. There were a few times I thought there were more psychological issues than just an alcohol issue."
This was a book that I read after reading the review in the Costco magazine :)I did not realize that it was a suspense book - and I don't think it is categorized as that. I did find it suspenseful however. I liked how similar scenarios were written from different people's perspective. It was a quick read.
"This book was a bit hard to follow at first and seemed scattered for a while. About a third of the way into the book one begins to get a handle on what is going on and it does get quite intriguing as you continue reading.  The characters are all very unlikable, not one with any redeeming quality.  I wouldn't say I loved this book, but it was worth finishing."
"Rather bizarre, but once you understand that chapters are written from the perspectives of the main characters, you'll enjoy the story more.  Looks like the movie, coming out in October, will be even better than the book."
"This story is revealed layer, by layer ... alternating point of view as it goes. It's a great way to tell a suspenseful story, but it's frustrating at the same time. I both wanted things to move faster AND I wanted to savor the story. It kept me guessing until the very end!"
Thanks to the heat wave I got to read this page-turner in 3 days.  Three very flawed women and one lying bastard-all unhappy with what they had and thinking something better was either out of his/her grasp or belonged to someone else.
drove me crazy trying to keep the characters & days & months straight!
Didnt enjoy this book. All the characters are idiots
The characters were so unlikable and annoying that I didn't look forward to continuing to read this book.  The only thing that kept me going was that I heard there was a surprise ending.  It wasn't much of a surprise.  About 3/4  of the way through the book I could see it coming.After all the buildup I was disappointed.
"I thought this book was really lame until about halfway through because I couldn't understand the narrator's motivation and why the reader should care. But this turned out to be worth the read. It's suspenseful, i just spent the last hour and a half finishing this during work! I recommend."
"Great Book, I really enjoyed it!  If you like twists and mystery buy this!"
"It is overall a good real, with a decent plot and well developed characters. The pace is a bit slow for my liking, and the ending did not come as a great surprise. I did find it to be an enjoyable read that is engaging, but I had higher expectations for it owing to the positive review/press I have read about it prior to reading the novel"
"Suspenseful story line and well crafted characters with lot's of depth.  The protagonist, Rachel, is sympathetic even when she seems to make very poor decisions in her life.  The setting is also very well thought out and depicts a suburban idealistic existence that represents Rachel's past life and the train, in many ways, speaks to the transience that she is currently experiencing."
"I thought this book was really lame until about halfway through because I couldn't understand the narrator's motivation and why the reader should care. But this turned out to be worth the read. It's suspenseful, i just spent the last hour and a half finishing this during work! I recommend."
"I enjoyed the intrigue of looking into the lives of the couples from the girl on the train as at first she seemed just an objective observer going to and from work while riding the train as any commuter does on a daily basis. Then the intrigue grows into great suspense as the girl on the train not only is revealed as a former family member of one of those couples, but the reader becomes the sleuth trying to solve the mystery. I had to force myself to turn the light off, stop reading, and go to bed."
"This book is definitely a page turner! The suspense keeps you wanting more as the story unfolds. I gave it five stars because each character brings something unique, yet twisted to the story not to mention that the plot is also well written. I will recommend this book to my friends."
"It seems like people either love or hate this book. I really liked it. I stayed up way too late several nights this week because I couldn't put it down. It reminded me of Gone Girl. There were some parts at the end that felt a little ridiculous, but I never found it boring like some people said."
"I expected more from all the hype this book was given. I had a hard time becoming invested in the characters. I did cringe with secondhand embarrassment from the main character a few times, but that was not a positive feeling."
"It is not the great novel I expected. Honetsly quite deceiving. Poor litterature and quite predictable in the end. I finshed the book though! It is true that catches you in a way you really want to know what will happens next. So in the end, I gave it 3 starts"
"This was selected by our book club.  It was an excellent book.  All the comparisons to Gone Girl are well-deserved.  This book was just as good, even better in some ways, than Gone Girl in terms of suspense."
A lot of people have compared this book to 'Gone Girl' and I can see the similarities. I thought the book was well written and kept you engaged. I have to say that none of the characters were particularly likeable although 'character likeability' is obviously not a requirement to determine if a book is worth reading. I would definitely recommend this for people who also enjoyed Gone Girl.
"I've seen this novel compared to Gone Girl, and I can see why, but I don't think they are in the same class. The story line of this book is compelling, but I did not find the execution  to be as well done as Gone Girl. A decent read, but not a great one."
"I had high hopes for this book as I heard it was as thrilling as ""Gone Girl"". That is just not the case.  However, it's an acceptable summer read. Writing is somewhat elementary, character development a little lacking, and the storyline predictable. I still enjoyed it, but it's not riveting. Still an acceptable read."
"Ok, don't think you can read it a little bit at a time. It needs to be read about an hour at a time. I kept falling asleep reading it, but that could just be me, because, honestly, I loved the book. I wish I had spent less time trying to figure it all out and just read the dang story for what it is....sigh....too much of a psy. major still in my head I suppose."
How in the world did this get on NY number 1?
"I ended up really enjoying this book, although it took me awhile to get into it. At first the story is disjointed in the telling, since you are getting different perspectives. I have read many books that employ this technique, so I think it can be done in a less confusing way. Overall though it was a good read and quite suspenseful. I would recommend!"
"Disappointing read.  Multiple points of view, but they all sounded so similar to each other.  And all the main characters were so unlikable that the ""whodunit"" fun was nearly ruined because you end up kind of not caring who did it.  Shouldn't be likened to ""Gone Girl,"" which was a much more compelling story."
"I was so excited to see the movie that I didn't want to read the book. Glad I did. It's a fast read and really good. You will figure out ""who Dunn it"" but it's still really good. Now I get to see the movie yah!!!"
When I saw the trailer for the movie I was instantly drawn to read the book. I could not put it down and read most of it in one day. I highly recommended this book and have to a colleague already. There was nothing I disliked. The book was well written.
The writers style I thought was boring & the story was hard to follow.  I read 3/4 & quit which I hated to do but I couldn't handle any more.
I didn't like Rachael at first but she grew on me. As you read along you find out how she became that way and how truly you could not really know someone. She drinks her life away. There is nothing I don't like about this book. It is slow to start but when you get past it's none stop. I kept going back and forth with who killed Megan but it the end it was obvious.
"Well written with believable characters, all of which are flawed. And those who lie when they don't have to lie should be the most feared of all. The story is excellent and one of the best I've read this year."
"I think this was an enjoyable read overall as a suspense, thriller-type mystery novel. There werr some aspects of the characters I found a bit whiny but I can appreciate their flaws. Still very good!"
"Without an entirely loveable heroine, the narrative was both fascinating and, at times, infuriating.  Ultimately, this led toan intriguing, somewhat dark, and truly well developed story, full of twists and surprises.  One doesn't want to get off""the train"" and when the ride ultimately ends. one wishes it could continue."
"I do understand where people are coming from when they compare this book with Gone Girl. I think you will enjoy this book if you liked Gone Girl because the writing style is similar. I enjoyed it for a fast read. A few of the situations seemed a bit of a character jump, but if you can just read it for what it is, it was a good story."
"I have to admit in the first third of the book I kept forgetting who I was actually reading about in the different chapters, but I eventually got into and it all started to make sense. Great Read."
"Good thriller, kept me interested until the end. Nothing special or new."
"A pretty good novel that forces you into the lives of several people, with a murder that brings the whole plot into focus.  Some may find the style a bit irritating as the chapters flip from one person to the next.  Each personality is similar enough that I sometimes had to look back to see which one was engaged.  I enjoyed the book and recommend it."
"I didn't care that much for it.  I didn't like the way it was written in singular persons, every chapter was a different character telling their story.  It did have a twist in the end.  I didn't like reading about all the drinking."
"I was honestly surprised that I liked this book as much as I did!  Thought it would be an ""ok"" book and as I progressed through the book I liked it more and more.  It is not a gory, bloody book - which is good!  But the twists surprise you, just when you thought you had it figured out!  Highly recommend this book."
"Exceptionally written.  The overall plot of the book was what I expected from the description, but it still kept my attention and the ending was a surprise.  The characters were extremely well developed and very believable. The writing made you feel like you were an observer as to what was going on.  You wanted to step into the book and help."
An extremely well written mystery. I had a new found sympathy for an alcoholic and realized how much she suffered and ruined her life even though she often tried to stop drinking.  Of course I couldn't wait to solve the mystery and was extremely surprised at the end!  I was completely absorbed throughout the book and hope she writes more mysteries like this one.
Great modern story. Somewhat predictable. But it was definitely hard to put down. Sometimes the struggle with Rachels addiction and memory lapses would be redundant. Also I feel the author could have gone into more depth of why she had this struggle and how important it was to Rachel to fix it. It would also be interesting to elborate on Tom's character/addiction.
"A. Book with a slow start that can only pick up as more lives are involved. In our book club someone called it Hitcockese, but I'm not sure I would. I gave it five starts because I thought it always had a story with a purpose."
I wouldn't compare it to gone girl like many other readers .... Slightly similar to Dark Places based on the flashback first person chapters but not as entertaining.  All of the characters are kind of blah and the chapters feel incredibly repetitive.  You get a feel of where the story is leading about 55% of the way so it compels you to keep going.
"This book gives a very accurate description of an alcoholic.  My tendency was to dislike this main character but I suppose that is what the author intended,  It's a good story and moves along nicely in spite of jumping from one narrator to another.  I did realize the guilty party a little sooner than I would like but that is no big deal."
"Bought this book for girlfriend who was interested in mystery/crime dramas and she could not put the book down. Overall she liked it a lot, but not quite as much as ""Gone Girl."" It was one of her favorite reads of the summer."
"I generally don't read this genre but I'd been seeing this book everywhere so I though I'd give it a try. Seeing as how it's the summer, it was only appropriate that I picked up a popular contemporary read.  As it turned out, I couldn't put the book down. It kept me on the edge of my seat until the very last page. Yes, I recommend it!"
"There was not one character that was likable,  I guess there are adults that act like these characters, but I don't know any and don't want to know any.  I also am not interested in reading about them.  This was a book club choice, not mine."
"I have seen this compared to Gone Girl, but personally I liked Girl on the Train much more.  I can usually guess an ending, but Paula Hawkins completely fooled me.  I really like her twisty narrative style.  When I reached the end, I went back to the beginning to understand how she had fooled me.  I laughed out loud in admiration.  Can't wait for her next book."
I genuinely cared about the characters.  There were times between reading I found myself worrying about them.  One chapter had me actually scared.  This rarely happens when I read.  I loved this book!
"Finally finished. It was a bit confusing at times, jumping from one characters perspective to another until I sorted them out . Main character a bit pitiful.The characters were well written and interesting. At times it did seem to drag on. The ending ties all the pieces together quite well. Main character still a bit pitiful. All in all I enjoyed it."
"I thought is was a well written thriller, and I am now ready for the movie to premiere!"
Not sure why this stays on the best seller list was not impressed didn't find it thrilling at all. I thought this was very predictable.
"If you liked Gone Girl, you'll love the Girl on the Train. Do you ever really know anyone? You'll ask yourself that question more than once as you read this novel. The character development is intriguing. You hurt for Rachel, feel for Anna, envy Megan. But are things what they really seem? This one is hard to put down.."
Read in two days.  Could not put it down.  A great debut novel and would be a perfect beach book that is actually a good read!
The story is told through the inner experience of each of its protagonists and not always in a linear time sequence. The author develops real characters in ways that retell the events with surprising shifts - a wonderful read.
I cannot wait for Ms. Hawkins next book. I am sure it will be just as great.  This boob kept my interest to the very end.  Iwas sad when the book ended.  I wish there were more pages to readConnie
"As I read this book, I could already see the movie coming out next year (cast your actors once you've finished).  Yes, it was reminiscent of ""Gone Girl"" as far as the narratives and dates but the overall tone was much softer than Gillian Flynn's.  It's a good mystery and even if you figure out who did it, the ending is still thrilling with a twist."
"I can't really see why this is a best seller.  A lot of it just dragged.  Way too many drunken blackouts.  Every character is totally dysfunctional, except for the baby.  The book is just over the top with needy, sick people.  I wouldn't recommend it.  At least I know what all the hype is about; I just don't think the book is worth the hype."
Great writing of a great story. Slow at times but the last 100 pages you cannot put down. I love the way she writes with each female receiving their own point of view. Great book! Can't wait to see what they do with the movie.
