This was the first audiobook I ever listened to so not sure if something was lost in translation here, if I just disliked the narrators, or if it is truly the book I hated - but man oh man I hated this book and have no idea what the hype is about.  Maybe if I READ it I would have liked it better but none of the characters were likable, the narration was rote and emotionless, and the writing was so ... basic.  ""I sat on the bed.  I got off the bed.  I sat back on the bed.  I poured myself another drink,  I don't want to drink.  I can't stop myself.  I'm going to drink.""

Sadly, I was only too happy to put it down -- if I could send it back and get a refund, I surely would!This is a story about a drunk and a hyper-sexed suburban housewife. First, a reader cannot really care about any of the sad and sick characters in the book; second, there is no suspense -- you know the plot line and conclusion within the first 100 pages; and third, a reader  has only one thing to sustain himself -- how long will it take the drunk to remember? It is a pointless story with prosaic prose (not a single highlighted sentence in my copy!) and paper-thin characters. II cannot think of a single redeeming quality about this book except that it did not go on any longer. Had it ended in the first 25 pages, I would have been grateful to the author for putting me out of my misery associated with buying this book!!Unless you are hankering to be bored or fall into a deep slumber while reading this book, do not buy or read it.",2,6,3,3,1,7,1,2,8,5

It seems like there wasn't too much thought put into the male characters, and the last quarter of the book doesn't feel organic -- it feels contrived and forced.The female lead's actions at the end also make her incredibly stupid.

She becomes interested in an ideal couple living in a house a few doors down from where she used to live, concocting an idyllic life for the two.  Then the wife disappears, and Rachel finds herself obsessed with the mystery -- where has she gone? What has happened? Can she help the grieving husband find answers and deflect suspicion away from him? Convinced she has seen things from the train that give her extra insight into the couple, she inserts herself into the investigation. Meanwhile Anna, Rachel's ex-husband's new wife, contributes to the narrative, giving us a different view of Rachel and her motives, and making no bones about the fact that she views Rachel's intervention as an attempt to stalk her family.  In chapters alternating between Anna, Rachel, and Megan, the woman who has disappeared from her perfect life, the book gives us 3 different points of view of the story -- none of which prepares  us for the book's shocking finale.",1,4,2,3,1,3,2,4,4,5

The three-way point of view is a stupid contrivance for a pathetic storyline. The only character I liked or respected was Evie.

I did finish it, just because I wanted to find out if Rachel was truly as crazy as I thought she was (she is).  I bought this based on ""if you liked Gone Girl, you'll love this"".  The only thing this book has in common with Gone Girl is that the main character was absolutely batshit crazy.  She's developed, but predictable.  She continually gets drunk, feels bad about it, then makes the same mistakes over and over again.  She is continually abusing the people in her life who are just trying to help her.

Because, while it's clever, it was excruciatingly slow to get to the point.  It is told in the first person, in turns, by three women, all s-l-o-w-l-y painting a hazy picture of a puzzle that isn't explained until the very last pages. It was extremely frustrating and a few parts were borderline boring.However, I was fascinated by the author's stream-of-consciousness style even in the present tense, which I usually dislike.  There is virtually no dialogue for the first 30 pages, just rambling thoughts. The pace definitely picked up toward the end and got really exciting.  Then, I was hooked and couldn't turn the pages fast enough to discover the very satisfying conclusion.There is a very small cast of characters, none of whom are very likable, and yet the book held my interest throughout.

"61",-3.65,"OK, I know it's only February, but I read a lot -- usually at least 3 to 6 books per month. I read this novel more slowly than normal, savoring the storyline, the prose, the character development. I found the concept of the storyline original and intriguing, the characters believable, and the ending surprising (so to the reviewer who expressed boredom and disappointment with an obvious conclusion, um, maybe you should be a detective or a mystery writer 'cuzl I so did not see that coming!) I was immediately drawn in and caught up in the story, and stayed up too late reading on more nights than is good for me if I want to keep my job. I found Ms. Harkins's writing entrancing, and even the shifting points of view and jumps back and forth in the chronology didn't bother me; rather they added a dimension of realism to the inevitable unreliability of multiple narratives.I'm not going to rehash the plot yet again. Yes, Rachel is a fall-down blackout lying drunk who's stalking her ex husband. Does that make her unsympathetic or unlikable? Maybe. She's also a disillusioned woman who has never fully dealt with devastating losses in her life. Which probably have contributed to her becoming a fall-down blackout lying drunk. (Yes, I know that's a sentence fragment.) Or, perhaps I just liked her because I used to be a fall-down blackout lying drunk with stalker tendencies. And, I guess the fact that I didn't foresee the ending can be attributed to brain damage from all that alcohol consumption.Anyway, I loved the book and didn't want it to end.

This is my honest review and I didn't find it riveting.I did, however, find that it was very well written and intriguing. I was about 3/4 of the way through the book before I something crucial clicked and once it did, it all made sense.It did take me several chapters to realize it was bouncing timeframes. I had gotten really confused until I went back and double checked the dates. Things fell into place better after that.I got quite angry at Rachel but that was the nature of her character. The book elicits most of the correct feelings and moods as it should but I wasn't riveted to it and it took me longer than it should have to read it.

"76",-13,"This is a story of nasty dudes and naive women. I loved it. It’s being compared to Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, but that’s not a good comparison. They are both amazing in their own ways and for very different reasons. This book has so many questions that have to be answered. Is Megan dead or did she run away? Both are plausible. Why is Rachel so obsessed with her? Is it just her imagination? Why is Tom so passive of Rachel’s constant intrusions? Who is sleeping with who? Does Anna have any redeeming qualities?The characters are flawed and some are downright detestable. The story focuses on three women: Rachel, the drunk who can’t let go of her ex-husband, Anna, the one who stole him away, and Megan, the beautiful missing woman.Rachel was a great character to read. She is completely broken and her only escape is with alcohol. The story is told from first-person perspective and doesn’t have a whole lot of dialogue, so her chapters were desperate and lonely. I could put myself in her shoes. She is someone who is easy to pity, as she travels the train everyday, pretending to go to a job that she was fired from months ago. Every day she looks at a house, only a few down from where she once lived, and watches a loving couple. She creates a make-believe world around them, perfect in every way. It’s an obvious set-up for disappointment.Anna is not likeable. At no point in the book did I feel anything for her but contempt. She knowingly begins an affair with a married man, none other than Rachel’s husband Tom, and effectively steals him away. Granted, Rachel’s depression makes it easy for her. At one point, while she’s admiring her and Tom’s sleeping baby, she remembers the days of sneaking around with him and admits that she misses being a mistress. She loved the sense of danger and wishes she could go back to it. All she feels towards Rachel is disgust. She was a good chunk of the book and suffice it to say that her chapters filled me with my own sense of disgust, aimed at her.Next is Megan, the one I’m not sure how to feel about. Partly, she reminds me of Anna, with her “I don’t care about anyone but me” attitude, but she also reminds me of Rachel, with her struggle against depression and insomnia. Her tragic past is the only part of her character that I could stand, as the rest of the time she’s thinking purely about herself and her memories of when she ran an art gallery and had men drooling over her. Surely, she would be appalled to be compared to Rachel, who is described as being overweight, drunk, and repulsive. Megan’s selfishness is sometimes nauseating, but then a wee bit of humanity shines through. Ultimately, I felt sorry for her, but I didn’t like her.The men in the story are a puzzle. There’s good and bad. It’s a confusing mess and I wasn’t always sure which man I was reading about through these women’s thoughts. Have no fear, the book did not leave me with a total sense of hopelessness concerning men in general, even though the author did not show them in a positive light.It’s definitely a mystery. I had inklings all the way through, but it wasn’t until about seventy percent through that I said, “Ah-ha!” I’m always impressed with a book that can keep me guessing more than halfway through and this one definitely did. It wasn’t a huge surprise to me, but it was an unpleasant one. In the beginning, everything is up in the air. No one is safe from doubt, not even poor Rachel. Nothing is completely settled until the very end, as it should be, leading to a perfectly short and powerful climax.The end was fulfilling, yet a little disappointing. I do not like happy-happy endings, but this one lacked hope. It was hinted at, but only one of these women gets to speak and her thoughts are still terrified and troubled. I would have liked to see more resolution for her. As it was, it felt sort of incomplete. My takeaway is that everyone lives in their own distorted version of reality and when the truth shows up it can have devastating repurcussions. So, don’t lie and don ‘t cheat.For the rating:Genre and general reading age – it’s a mystery and thriller. Reading age is adult, due to some really difficult scenes and references, including excessive drinking by more than one of the characters. Sometimes I wondered how they were able to stand up.The level of sexuality – for the amount of cheating involved, it was surprisingly mild. There weren’t actual sex scenes, but memories of trysts and a morning after.Was there graphic language? Not much.Did I cry? Nope.Is it part of a series? Nope.Level of character development was very high. Out of the three men and three women who make up the story, only one was a bit weak. The others were strong and I could see them in my mind.Did I laugh? Nope.This was a fantastically-written story and once I picked it up I couldn’t put it down, literally. I stayed up late into the night with this one. I’m happy to give it <U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F>.5 stars. It was almost perfect.",16,14,15,19,15,22,9,25,36,33

"102",-6.7,"The Girl on the Train is yet another twist on the classic whodunit. The story is told through the point of view of three women, each with their own flaws and secrets. We meet Rachel Watson, a drunk, unemployed, divorcee who daydreams about the ""perfect"" life of Jess and Jason - a couple she only knows by seeing them from the train every day. When Jess (Megan Hipwell) turns up missing, Rachel takes it upon herself to solve the case. Through a series of lies and deceit, Rachel finds herself face to face with a cast of male characters (all deeply flawed themselves), anyone of whom could be the killer.My thoughts on the book:The writing style is just horrendous and completely unnecessary. The entire book is written in first person, though our POV switches between the three female characters: Rachel, Megan, and Anna. This can lead to confusion when the action flips back and forth. Had this use of first person worked to reveal something about the characters that could just not be said through third-person omniscient, it could have worked. But it was complicated by the fact that each chapter was broken into ""Morning"" and ""Evening"", so the tense switched back and forth between present and past tense. I get that breaking it up this way reflects the two train trips, one in to the city, one back home, but it is unnecessary as most of the action takes place off the train. These two combined makes it difficult to read.This is Hawkins' first novel, and it shows. The bland writing style bored me to death, and it took everything I had in me to finish the book. Stephen King can spend 80% of a book writing about nothing and I love every word of it. Hawkins drew out a boring story where we learn to hate every character involved. Not a single character has a good redeeming quality.I was genuinely surprised when the killer was revealed. I was not shocked, however, and this is a huge negative. When I read the reveal in ""Gone Girl"", I had to put the book down. I could not continue because I had to process what I had just read. I have had this happen in many other books. Good fiction is emotional. You feel shocked because you're so invested in the story and characters. Here, I was just glad it was over.Conclusions:I read this book simply because the movie is coming out soon and it was well known and liked. I was disappointed throughout, and expected much more. There are many things (see above) that could have improved this book. The plot was not bad, it was just poorly developed. The characters were not unbelievable, but they sure were unlikable. The style and prose were atrocious; nothing short of a full rewrite could have saved that.Read at your own risk. If being part of the crowd is more important to you than reading quality fiction, this is your book.",8,10,6,11,5,10,5,9,18,19
"108",-3.8,"pooled ink Reviews:2.5 StarsObviously I was hyped after watching that thrilling movie trailer and decided I would buy the book and read it before I saw the movie. So I did. And now I’m slightly less inclined to see the movie. (But I’ll probably still go because a) Emily Blunt and b) Ooooo it looks crazy!)The book travels up and down the rails following Rachel’s cyclic battle with alcoholism and her obsession with solving Megan’s case as she continues to tangle her life with those linked to Megan, get incredibly drunk, make embarrassing not-great decisions, realizes what she’s done, decides not to drink for half a second and then downs a bottle or two of wine to drown out her embarrassment and misery only to make more poor decisions. It became wearing to read about it for so many pages. Alcoholism is a real problem, I know that, and I also know that I don’t sound very sympathetic, but that’s why I didn’t go to school to become a therapist.The whole book was pretty consistent…and boring. And the killer? It was obvious. I bet you can guess who it was. And the why? It’s pretty easy to guess as well, at least part of it.It’s not a very long book…but it felt long. It felt like the same stuff over and over again. There was nothing exhilarating, surprising, jolting, unnerving. I felt none of it. The only part I enjoyed was the ending of the book when characters starting changing, clues started showing, and all the little lines began meeting to reveal what happened that Saturday night when Megan went missing.All in all this book is filled with sad people with messed up lives making stupid decisions that only work to further ruin their lives. I was tired of reading about it. I just kept waiting for someone to do something worth applauding, but that didn’t come until the very end.Psychological thriller? I think not. THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is a dull commute that only succeeded in making me snooze as I let the gentle rocking of the train lull me into a stupor.

So I ignored this NYT best seller for months but saw that it's being made into a movie and decided to give it a shot.  This is indeed a ""Hitchcockian"" thriller that slowly unwinds and leads to an ending that wraps things up but is a bit unsatisfying...maybe because after all the build up I expected more.  Still, this is one of the more engaging books I've read in awhile and it was hard to put down once I got going.  Alcoholic train commuter Rachel likes to watch out the window going to/from the city and enjoys making up a life for a couple she frequently sees outdoors on their terrace.  Then she witnesses what appears to be infidelity and then someone goes missing but Rachel's frequent alcohol fueled blackouts make her unsure of what she's seen and what she truly knows.

"116",-3.7,"First off, I think there is somewhat of a ""herd"" mentality in the overall negative ratings by some reviewers of this book. With that off my mind...I see real value in the epiphanies each of the three female characters experienced within the unfolding of the story.Rachel literally rides the train and, to my interpretation, is  also, figuratively riding the train of alcoholism leading to some serious self delusion. She blames the failure of her marriage entirely on herself and carries the burden of the resultant guilt. She never saw her husband clearly. While riding the train into London everyday she invests emotional attachment to a young couple she observes in a house she passes everyday...so much so... she bestows upon them her own made-up names. Events in her own life and in the lives she is observing conspire to literally and figuratively make her get off the train. These events are suspenseful and make for a great storyline. Both Anna and Megan each have different self discoveries. The male characters do not seem to evolve and if anything, each one you meet shares culpability in the main event of the book.  Particularly odious to me (and he is written to actually smell bad) is Scott for his hyper aggressive selfish character; his bullying and his assault of Rachel. Just a personal observation and opinion.Careful reading of this book will yield many clever literary devices. The fact that there is not one smile described as genuine from joy at its root in the whole book.""Everything about him is warm—his hands, his eyes, his voice—everything but the smile. You can see the killer in him when he shows his teeth.""Another is the symbolism behind the small pile of rocks in the corner of Megan and Scott's garden.It is not written as an intense suspense narrative with accelerated pacing and should not be compared with such.  It is written more like a jigsaw puzzle with the pieces to the puzzle locked inside the seemingly blackout mind of the ""Girl on the Train"".

"158",-3.15,"It’s hard to be objective about a novel that strives so determinedly (and successfully) to make its characters as unlikable as those in Paula Hawkins’ bestselling mystery, “The Girl On the Train”. With not one, but three, unreliable narrators jumping back and forth in time offering first-person perspectives on unfolding events, the book chronicles the intertwined stories of sad-sack drunkard, Rachel, the titular girl on the train; Megan, the secretive blonde half of a seemingly perfect couple Rachel spies on from the train; and Anna, a hard-edged suburbanite who envisions herself as the perfect wife and mother.The central mystery begins when one of the women goes missing.The main narrative, necessarily, comes from Rachel, still wallowing in booze and self-pity years after her husband left her for the younger, prettier Anna. In fact, Anna, the usurper, and Rachel’s ex-husband are still living in the same house that once belonged to Rachel. Having lost her job due to drunkenness, Rachel still takes the train each day from the suburbs into London, not only to make her sober-minded roommate think she’s still gainfully employed, but also to keep an eye on her ex and the woman occupying her old home; the train just happens to pass right by the place. A few doors down lives a beautiful young couple whom Rachel also watches, becoming a little too fascinated by their lives lived largely out in the back yard and through open windows. Although Rachel nicknames them Jess and Jason and envies what she perceives to be their idyllic wedded bliss, it soon becomes apparent that appearances are deceiving, especially after she witnesses a shocking act that shakes up her vicarious fantasy life. But, did she, in fact, see what she thought she saw? Rachel’s reality is blurred from heavy drinking which often results in blackouts; her problems are compounded by her stalking of not only her ex-husband, Tom, and his increasingly agitated wife, but of Scott and Megan, the real-life “lovebirds” Rachel knows as Jess and Jason. What follows is a harrowing, sometimes confusing yarn that allows for no “good guys” and sees Rachel making one misstep after another after another until finally, I lost patience with her to the point that I found it difficult to finish the book. A main character doesn’t necessarily have to be likable, or even relatable, to maintain a good story but they should offer up something—sympathy, grudging admiration, even hatred—to keep the reader hooked in to that character, to want to know what happens to him or her. Rachel used up what sympathy I had for her very quickly, and while I didn’t like her at all, I didn’t dislike her enough by the end to care what happened to her. By the time she finally rallies from her downtrodden hangdog state, it was too little, too late; I simply didn’t care. However, being very familiar with the behavior of alcoholics, I did find Rachel’s behavior to be believable (for the most part), if tiring.The character of Megan was more interesting, and perhaps, more sympathetic. With dark secrets in both her past and present, Megan is a well-structured character who is damaged and self-destructive, not a nice woman but not someone who is intentionally cruel. Her own missteps, more dramatic than Rachel’s (at least early on), are poignant and truly heartbreaking, and while the character of Rachel is the protagonist of the story, it is Megan who really drives it.Anna, the third voice in “Girl On the Train”, is probably the least developed of the three narrators. Presented as a vain, calculating homewrecker whose deeds are doubling back on her, Anna is something of a narcissist, who is, understandably, at the end of her rope with Rachel and her attendant drama. Anna considers herself to be clear-headed and sane compared to the other female characters in the novel, although her narcissism precludes her from seeing that she’s as deluded as they are.The problem I found with having three narrators is that their voices begin to seem strangely similar as one chapter featuring Anna flows into the next chapter, narrated by Rachel, and so on. If Rachel isn’t on a drunken binge, it’s difficult to separate her musings from those of Anna; in more than one instance, I found myself thumbing back to the beginning of a chapter to see if it was titled “Rachel”, “Anna” or “Megan”.The men in the story are also difficult to separate in some instances, and even more sketchily written than Anna. Tom, Anna’s husband and Rachel’s ex, is very much like Scott, Megan’s husband, and neither seems to be all that distinctive. There’s also a shady psychiatrist on hand who doesn’t seem to balk at bedding his patients, and a couple of cops who never come to life, existing merely as words on a page. Of course, they’re an awkward necessity in moving the story forward (and in offending Rachel).Also awkward is the fact that characters narrate events in the present, often simultaneously with a different character in the following chapter, while another character narrates events from months, or years, earlier. Again, it’s a necessity in moving the story forward (and in tying up all the loose ends) but it feels awkward. The solution to the mystery, when it comes, isn’t surprising but it is serviceable and doesn’t insult the reader’s intelligence.As trying as I often felt “The Girl On the Train” to be, it does offer up some suspense, and isn’t altogether horrible. Paula Hawkins writes well and I hope she’ll up her game on her next literary outing.",8,13,8,12,13,13,9,19,26,28

"186",-1.75,"This is the story of three awful women.  If they formed a support group and if support groups had mottoes, I suggest that theirs would be “I needed this, so I gave myself permission to take it.”  And what do awful women end up with if not awful husbands and boyfriends?This novel is in epistolary form, except that chapters are in the form of morning and evening diary entries instead of letters.  In addition, the chapters aren’t in chronological order.  So one woman’s narrative is followed in the next chapter by another woman’s narrative from a year earlier.  It was a little confusing at first, but it wasn’t hard to get the hang of it.Rachel, the protagonist, is the most well-developed and interesting character.  In addition, the scenes are sketchy.  But in every other respect, what the writer does for the beginning two-thirds of the book, exhibits a mastery of detail and pacing, particularly in Rachel’s narrative as she makes her way in these urban and suburban settings.  These chapters have fine literary qualities, enticing the reader to continue.However, the writer doesn't smoothly integrate this literary first part of the novel with the overall detective mystery orientation.  The last third of the book (the “caboose”, let’s say) becomes a regular mystery story, written in more of a mass-market paperback style, but the first part makes it all worthwhile.As we gradually discover more and more about Rachel, some readers might find it depressing.  Without giving too much away, here’s something to help you hang in there.  Rachel’s second worst vice, her lack of respect for boundaries, is what keeps her from succumbing to her worst and most deadly vice.This is not a good gift for the younger kids.

"188",-2.2,"I'm not certain why this book has been compared to Gone, Girl.  To me, it was written very differently and outside of a woman being missing and the husband being a suspect, they weren't anything alike in my opinion.This book was picked by my book club and I had a hard time finishing it.  My problem was that I disliked each and every character, but especially the main character, Rachel.  She is a person who makes the same decisions to drink, black out, then wakes up confused but knowing she's ""done something bad"".  She phones her ex husband on a regular basis, drunk, crying and/or  harassing he and his wife; she sponges off her roommate who for some reason puts up with her drinking and passing out constantly.  Rachel goes through a repetitious cycle of drinking, blacking out and waking up knowing she has ""done something bad"".  The thing is, she makes the same decisions over and over.  I wanted to personally slap her midway through the story and thereafter.  I nearly stopped reading it several times.I could barely get through this book and the only reason I finished it was to find out what actually happened to the missing woman.

I like that she comes to realize how off-base her interpretation is. I also liked that she is an unreliable narrator trying to fill in her own story gaps.I was frustrated by several things. First, the chapters alternate between different characters (a style that I am tiring of in novels), but they are also different timelines. Often the chapters were a bit longer, so I didn't always finish my reading section at the end/beginning of a chapter, and when I returned to the story I didn't necessarily remember whose chapter/timeline I was in. And because I was reading on a Kindle, I sometimes had to click-click-click through pages to find that information from the beginning of the chapter (because it wasn't always readily apparent by context).Second, there was a certain point in the novel where the clues culminated in ""whodunit,"" but the character was slow to catch on after that point which I found frustrating.Finally, the ending fell flat to me. The story as a whole seemed to be written in a particular style, but the final scenes were reminiscent of a typical murder/suspense formula.About 2/3 of the way through, I just wanted to get to the end to see how it turned out.

Now, imagine the heroine does this over and over again. Really?

"214",-0.4,"My first thought after reading this book was “yup, it lived up to the hype”. This is a fantastic debut novel- one that I won’t soon forget. Does it live up to the Gone Girl status? Yes, in a way it does. The story has the same type of unreliable narrator who is suffering from her own problems and us readers don’t know whether to believe her or not. Can we readers guess who is behind Megan’s disappearance? Nope. I wanted to think I knew who did it, but when I really found out I was as shocked as everyone else. This book is awesome, albeit, a bit dark and depressing. I had so many feelings while reading this that my head started to spin! Honestly, if you haven’t picked this one up yet than I implore you to do so. It’s just a very, very, good book! No wonder it got a goodreads award!Anyway, the book is about a woman named Rachel who rides the same commuter train every day. At first I wanted to believe it was because she had to work like everyone else, but I was lead to believe wrong. You see, Rachel is hiding from her demons. She lost her job because she is an alcoholic and is trying to hide this news from her flat mate. It’s crazy how well Rachel is hiding her wrong-doings and I can’t help as a reader feeling a bit bad for her. So what Rachel does on this train (each, and every day) is watch the houses go by. But not only this, she fantasizes about the people who live there. You see, she is already familiar with this neighborhood as she used to live there- with her husband- until he left her for another woman. And stranger things continue to happen- her ex-husband now lives in the same house he shared with her, with the woman he left her for. Pretty twisted if you ask me! Either way, Rachel’s fantasizing, her mixed up emotions for her ex-husband and his new wife, and now a murder mystery begins to plague Rachel’s life. She starts with one bad decision- and her life begins to spin even more out of control than it was previously. Yikes! The happenings in this book are quite unbelievable and twisted.Overall, I loved everything about this book. It’s dark, twisted, depressing, and unique.

Not only was the character development better, the book didn't strain the bounds of reader credulity as did ""Gone Girl.""  The sexual crudeness of ""Gone Girl"", the unnecessary profanity that was actually pretty disgusting, was also absent in ""The Girl on the Train.""

They're not very likable, they're depressing, and they don't have much taste in men.Rachel is the girl on the train. She's lost her job for drinking on the job. Her husband has left her for another woman, and to top matters off, he's had a baby with his new wife, with whom he was carrying on an affair while still married to Rachel. That's what broke up Rachel's marriage; she couldn't have a baby. She takes the train to work every day to fool her land lady roommate (the nicest woman in the book) into thinking she still has a job. The part about the train has to do with two people she sees almost every day on their veranda. She doesn't know them, but she convinces herself they're the happy couple. She even gives them names. They live a few doors down from where she used to live with her husband Tom.The second woman is Megan. Megan lives with a horrible secret I won't reveal here. Let's say, psychologically, it has affected her. She's the woman in the ideal couple, but she's far from ideal. She sleeps around; she even makes a move on her therapist. It's not clear whether he sleeps with her, but Rachel does see them kissing from the train.  Megan also winds up dead. That's the best part of the book as far as suspense is concerned. I read a lot of mysteries, and usually I can tell who did it within the first fifty pages, but there are several candidates here, and I didn't know who killed Megan until the author told me.The third woman might be the creepiest of all. She had an affair with Tom and she knew he was married. She even reveled in it. The woman is close to a sociopath. She only cares about her own little world, her husband and her baby. When she is confronted with a physical threat she runs away. Some might argue that she's only protecting her baby, but it seems to be more than that. She also does something creepy during the denouement to someone who can't defend himself/herself.I really don't see how this book has stayed on the best seller list for most of the year. As I said above, about the only redeeming quality is the “who done it” aspect. It's also hard to believe that Megan, who worked at an art gallery before it closed, would babysit for people she barely knew, that is unless you consider that the author needed her to. Her horrible secret also involves a baby. This is called author intrusion, and it's a bad “no no” for literary critics.",4,5,4,8,4,6,2,7,10,11

"266",-5.4,"In a nutshell: it was ok.Let me start by briefly explaining why I chose this book. Everyone seemed to be raving about it. Even NYPL! So, as usual.. I thought: I need thisin my life! I had (unfortunately) high expectations about this book and I didn't even bother to read what was it about. I read that it was similarto Gone Girl, I even quote: ""“The Girl on the Train has more fun with unreliable narration than any chiller since Gone Girl. . . . [It] is liable to draw a large, bedazzled readership.”—The New York Times"".In my opinion, it is just an ok book. I still have my doubts if it is a cleverly plotted thriller. Paula Hawkings indeed tried to present compelling characters,but to me, they were a bit too predictable and in some cases, annoying. Now, it alternates between three points of view (all females), and to me, tends to fall to unnecessary (not always, but in this case) and gimmicky. Basically the whole mystery is a mess right up until the last chapters, where you get a grip of the situation. The ending for me was extremely melodramatic, and I thought for a minute I just read a Hollywood movie. Very few real twists, first chapters are monotonous. Plain and simple: just mediocre.While on Gone Girl we saw how the author fought back against female cliches of the accommodating victim or love interest with a cold, calculating villain, The Girl on the Train takes a less defiant angle. The main character: Rachel is delivered through an unwittingly unreliable narration to evoke the aftershocks of abuse and trauma. Do I think this was a powerful way of exploring women's marginalization? Not entirely. I am not 100% convinced. I did not like any of the characters, and to be quite honest, the male roles were a bit stereotyped (that is just my impression). I do not get what is the hype about this book? It isn't a bad one, but surely not a master piece either! It is a bit depressing even?Conclusion:*It is an ok book, touching the limits with mediocre? Take this book for your summer holidays at the most. Do not expect a deep, fascinating suspense book.*Boring, a little bit depressing? At the end picks up the pace and you feel more hooked.*Complex but a bit predictable characters.*Easy to read!",8,11,6,9,6,7,6,9,21,17
"267",-0.95,"This book, read from the perspectives of three different women on divergent and convergent timelines, leaves quite a bit to be desired. Paula's writing is difficult to follow, the characters are mostly unlikable and make very questionable decisions. Common sense is apparently lacking in this particular part of England.What started off as a novel premise eventually meanders its way into half-truths, mis(sing)-information, and lots of ""surprises"" that are less surprises and more like the guy who tells a joke but has to keep going back and adding in more detail because he forgot. This frustrating novel is really just a  long joke, with lots of ""oh yeahs"" and ""I forgot"" (literally).If all of the characters involved got hit by the titular train I think this book would be more compelling.

"270",-5.7,"Disappointing after all the hype. The plot was twisted and unpredictable, which was good, but I stopped caring about what happened because the characters were so uninteresting. The story was told from the point of view of three female characters: Rachel, the primary character, was whiny and weak, still pining for a broken marriage with a nasty two-timer; Anna, the woman he cheated with, didn't come to life at all; and Megan, a neighbor of Anna's, seemed to be calmly narrating her fate even while expiring. In any case, I failed to connect with any of them. And the male characters, without giving the ending away, were disturbing and violent.

It allows you to see the same scene from the eyes of different characters. That being said, I did figure out the ending without meaning to. Maybe it's all those crime shows I watch. I guess I just can't be thrilled by the thrillers the way I used to be. I also found that a couple of the character's voices were too similar for their differing personalities, but that's just me being picky.

I do feel it ended rather weak.....missing that OMG feeling as I turned the last page. And still I have two remaining questions???(Possible SPOILER BELOW)1) What ever happened to Scott?

"303",-0.2,"I think that what the book lacked in the beginning and middle, it made up for in the ending. I, of course, won't spoil it here, but it is very slow up until the ending which was somewhat predictable. The characters, main included, are somewhat dry, and altogether predictable. I can't help but imagine that the book would have been a much better read if told from Anna's perspective, as she was one of the only complex characters. Affairs are the key point of the book, though none take turns away from the predictable. The book spoils itself around the middle--towards the end, providing 1-2 red herrings before finally settling into the finale; naturally tidying the story and hitting all of the tropes of a murder mystery unabashedly. For myself, I read the book expecting the caliber of story that a Gillian Flynn novel may provide, a good airport page-turner to get me through a flight. Though this was a book that bored me in the beginning, middle, hooked me 30 pages before the ending, and finally disappointed me. I usually refrain from giving negative reviews, but honestly I wish someone would have let me know that there was better junk-lit out there. Try Gillian Flynn, Stephen King, or anything really. If you are tremendously bored, give this one a go. I couldn't pay attention to this book and ended up playing with my napkin if that gives you any notion of how this book is read.",2,7,4,1,4,4,4,5,6,12
"306",-5.65,"Rachel Watson is a down-on-her-luck young woman who rides the train in and out of London every day to hide the fact that she has lost her job from her roommate, and to maintain a tenuous link to what she once was: gainfully employed, happily married and sober. One particular house near the railway tracks fosters an increasingly unhealthy obesssion in Rachel on these daily trips, with its seemingly perfect couple who sit on the terrace. Is it a secret longing for what Rachel once had? Or something more forbidding, something on her own emotional doorstep?With its Hitchcock like setup and close similarity to Gillian Flynn’s work, ‘Girl on a Train’ opens with this compelling story question. Then Rachel’s blurred recollection of a crime she witnesses in a drunken stupor causes her to stumble through the lives of others, wreaking havoc on ex-neighbors, her ex-husband, and aggravating the police, who soon lose patience with Rachel’s drinking and lies. You may actually find yourself doing the same as she keeps hitting the bottle.But ultimately ‘Girl on a Train’ disappoints. It just can’t live up to its promising start.If ever there was an unreliable narrator, it’s Rachel.And this is part of the book’s problem: The reader is too often misled into feeling one way about a character, only to have it not be so. The mystery itself relies too heavily upon Rachel’s opportune blackouts, taking us to the edge of discovery only to learn that she just can’t quite remember what happened. Until she does. And then the murderer does something so dumb (keeping a key piece of evidence any killer worth their salt would surely have gotten rid of) that it violates the ‘maximum capacity’ rule of a worthy villain. He/she also manages to give the clichéd, expository summing up toward the end of the book, explaining in detail the crimes committed and the motives for committing them.Like Gillian Flynn’s books, the parallel to ‘Girl on a Train’ is apparent: multiple narrators switching back and forth in first person as the crime unravels, everyday people living lives of quiet desperation, marriages that appear to be perfect but aren’t. But whereas Flynn’s writing can soar, and her characters are rich and nuanced, Paula Hawkins’ prose is deliberate and too ordinary to make us want to spend so much time in her character’s heads. There are clarity issues in the story telling as well, not helped by the fact that all three narrators are young English women of the same age, same class, with similar backgrounds and voices.Girl on a train is a solid suspense read however, although mystery buffs will find themselves want more.",7,12,5,12,6,9,6,10,19,23
"307",-1.1,"I gave this book four stars because I really enjoyed reading it, and sometimes couldn't put it down. I would have given it five stars but for some reason I had a VERY hard time with the fact that Rachel rode the train everyday to pretend that she didn't lose her job. That she would get ready, ride the train in the morning, find something to do for eight hours, and then ride it home, just because she didn't want her landlord to find out she'd lost her job. Doing all of this while dealing with alcoholism and depression just doesn't sound believable to me. As long as she paid her rent on time, why would it matter if she lost her job?  Each chapter would be from a different person's point of view which would sometimes get annoying and confusing, but in the end made for a very mysterious and enjoying read.",3,5,2,3,1,4,2,2,6,4
"313",-2.3,"The Girl on the Train is the perfect thriller to read on a trip--it's quick and easy to read, it's intriguing, and it keeps you guessing.I have to say, Hawkins has done a great job at creating a slew of characters to dislike. I don't mean that as a bad thing, though. I thoroughly enjoyed reading a book where I felt like I was my own detective, trying to solve a mystery where I couldn't even trust the narrators. There was some type of a plot twist around every corner, and in the end, I was very much satisfied by the climax and conclusion Hawkins created. (I'll add a quick caveat here that there was one part of the story towards the end about one of the character's backgrounds that is so quickly explained, that it felt like an afterthought thrown in for necessity, but not development--that was disappointing).The only major complaint I had about this book was that so much of it felt unoriginal and cliche to me. The characters were somewhat dull: Rachel is an alcoholic, Megan is a restless obsessive, and Anna is a narcissist. But very little of each of these character's traits were developed further. And the men in this book were so black-and-white that I sort of pity any man who reads this book because the stereotypes are so plain to see--the men are either doting, kind-hearted lovers or oppressive, jealous villains.But then again, maybe these cliches were exactly Hawkins point--to make the setting and characters so ordinary that it made the story just that more chilling.",5,4,4,2,5,7,3,5,8,8

She rides the train to and from London everyday, caught up in her thoughts and swimming in the aftereffects of a night of drinking. The train always stops at a row of houses, where Rachel sees Jason and Jess living out their romantic lives. Rachel witnesses an argument between Jason and Jess and the next morning Jess is reported missing. Rachel is thrown into the mystery surrounding Jess’ disappearance while clashing with the lives of her ex-husband Tom and his wife Anna.A cast of suspicious characters make an appearance as Rachel works to discover the murderer. Though the killer’s identity is well hidden, the story reads less as a “who done it” and more like a sympathetic narrative of a suffering woman tossed around by circumstances. I identified with the struggle of the three different narrators, their ugliness ringing as true as their virtues. This is a great summer read and will keep you up as you rush to discover the ending.

She daydreams about a  couple a few doors down from where she used to live  and she occasionally  sees one or both of them and others as the train passes.  She imagines their life together as perfect and as what she had so longed for.  She is so devastated about being left for another woman who had her ex-husband's baby and she feels so sad that she lost him and agrees with him that she was to blame.  The sad part is, she had  been systematically taken apart, her pride, her will , her sense of self , by  a sociopath who enjoys seducing, controlling, and then draining women of any sense of worth and when he succeeds, abandons them as they are unworthy.  Some tiny little glimmer in her peeks out  and she ends up intervening in the life of the husband of the young couple  when  the wife disappears and the husband  is a suspect (and she has seen another man with the wife).  Very difficult to read and harder to put down and, while true to itself, nothing is as it seems.

"344",-0.5,"This story moves, propelling the reader onward.  The author is a good and descriptive writer and gives an immediate impression of the gist of each of the characters she follows.  If you are looking for a suspense read that will pull you in and make you want to finish the book in a weekend, this does the trick.Rachel, the ""Girl on the Train,"" who imagines the lives of a couple whose house she passes every day, is a drunk.  Daily, her train also passes the house she used to call home, now inhabited by her ex-husband and the woman he left Rachel for.  Twice daily on her commute, Rachel alternately mourns for the life she lost (and curses the women who supplanted her) and imagines the perfect couple down the street from her old home whom she views from her commuter's window but doesn't know.  Maybe due to her reliance on being drunk to cope with a life that has severely disappointed her, Rachel often is hesitant to act when contemplating a decision.  This does make some of the chapters repetitious at times, but the author's strong sense of place and use of description largely mitigates this criticism.Comparison's to Rear Window are obvious.  As with the Hitchcock masterpiece, Rachel gets involved when she witnesses an incident from her train that is out of sync with the imagined life of the couple she views every day - the couple about whom she has constructed a vivid, if alcohol fueled, perfect life.  There are a lot of plot twists, though this is the kind of book where most of them are revealed by the three protagonists and not pieced together from a well laid foundation of clues.A good book, quick read and pretty good freshman effort from this author.",2,5,1,1,6,3,4,7,5,18

The observed neighbor, Megan, who has a complicated life and demeanor far from Rachel imagination. And Anna, her former husband's new wife.The conflicting POV work fine for a while, until half the book. There it stumbles a bit with contrived twists. Perhaps the weaker point of the novel (spoilers aside) is that in many ways pretends to be a whodunit, with a very small pool of suspects. The best point is the characterization of the women (all of them, even Rachel's roommate, poor old good-sport Claire; exception noted for non convincing detective Riley), and the misogynous dark world they inhabit, where beyond roleplaying as companions, mothers, wives, lovers, sinners or victims, there's not much left for them to aspire.Good first fiction effort by Hawkins.",0,3,0,0,3,1,2,4,4,9
"350",-0.4,"As appears on Goodreads.com I finished this on St. Paddy's Day and I'm still torn between 3 and 4 Stars. Author, Paula Hawkins had me spell bound. Her writing is fierce - she certainly knows how to spend a very suspenseful tale, keeping the reader quickly turning the pages despite ALL of her very unlikeable characters.Rachel is Tom Watson's ex-wife. She is quite pathetic. She's a drunk and unemployed. But each morning she rides the train to London (to save face) pretending she's just another commuter. And the train always stops very near her old house where she was happy and hopeful with Tom. A few doors down live a beautiful couple that she's dubbed ""Jess and Jason."" She imagines their life together, giving them wonderful attributes and marriage. Looks can be deceiving as the real ""Jess"" - Meagan - shows us. Tom's current wife hates Rachel and truly believes that Tom's ex-wife is unstable and dangerous to her, Tom, and their baby daughter. Everything is going as smoothly as each woman's situation can go until one of them suddenly disappears. Rachel must interject herself in the investigation. After all, she's invested a year of mornings and evenings watching this woman. Bad decision, girlfriend.The story line is told from each of the three women's altering POV, and that technique is powerful and makes the novel work. As I've said there is not one redeemable or likeable character in the whole book, but the reader is also a Rachel - a voyeur of a sort like in ""Rear Window.""

Then my interest began waning and quickly was transformed to annoyance, impatience, outright irritation and finally, full-blown dislike. I ended up really disliking this book. I thought the plot was so implausible and contrived - and, of course, many suspense/mystery novels are implausible and contrived, but this is yet another one of the type that has no foot in reality - as to be unacceptable. It veered into absurdity. More than that, however, was my increasingly intense dislike for all of the characters - every single one of them, but probably most of all, the main character, Rachel. I found her alcoholism, her black-outs, her laxity, her passivity, her strange behavior even outside of her alcoholic binges, everything about her just repugnant. But that was true of every character for different reasons and to varying degrees of dislike. The stylistic technique of alternating ""voices"" was OK and the different female characters represented in those voices were fairly well distinguished, enough so as to follow ""their chapters.""  One thing that I did appreciate, and it stands on contrast to ""Gone Girl"", was the absence of detailed, specific, ""graphic"" sexual material. There were indirect references but we weren't forced into the beds, bodies and minds of people in sexual encounters - and I appreciated that!  I didn't find any obvious type or similar types of editing errors, also appreciated. I thought the basic style and quality of writing was OK, outside of plot. Character development was OK, but they were just so thoroughly unlikeable and unlikely, in my opinion.2016 has been a year that for me, as an enthusiastic reader, has been a year in which I have learned to distrust blurbs, critics, and reviews in general.  I have read too many books this year that were glowingly reviewed, best-selling, even award nominees - and yet left me thinking:  where have all the great novels gone?

Been a little too violent in an argument with a SO? Drunk-dialed/texted an ex, over and over, or just embarrassed yourself by being able to let go? Made a fool of yourself? Came to work hung over and useless? It's a good read, for sure. I'm sure reviewers like to use words like ""unflinching"" to describe it.I personally just enjoy books with characters that beat back the stereotypes. Rachel totally did that. She's overweight and totally makes a fool of herself repeatedly.

Megan is one of those people, and she spends every day fighting within her own head about what to do — does she still likes her husband, or should she run away? Anna is the new wife of Tom, Rachel’s ex-husband. They live in Rachel’s old house with their baby girl, Evie. Rachel, depressed with how her life has turned out, spends her days drinking, usually ending with making a rude, drunken call to Tom.One day, Rachel sees Megan’s face in the news — she’s gone missing. Rachel has to battle her blackouts — she knows she saw something important, but she can’t remember. She knows she has to help.This book, widely regarded as the next “Gone Girl,” is a psychological thriller. It’s a strange feeling, as a reader, when the main character is such an unlikeable woman who is unwilling to help herself. However, with more and more information, more revelations, you begin to see why she is how she is.

As if the divorce and her inability to have children is not enough, Rachel is constantly reminded of Tom’s new life without her every day as she passes by their home that was once hers on the train each day.  She is obsessed with them and their neighbor Megan and her husband.  The story is told from the perspective of the three women; Rachel, Anna and Megan.  As Rachel’s life continues to disintegrate throughout the novel, her obsession with the couples along with her drinking problem continues to get worse.  As her life falls apart, she becomes engrossed with Megan’s disappearance and trying to solve what happened to her.  With the three perspective stories the reader is left trying to figure out what eventually happens to Megan upon her disappearance and how all three women are connected.  The climax and ending of the book is truly shocking and will leave you wanting more from Paula Hawkins.  The plot would make an excellent movie and I am looking forward to more work from this author.",1,6,2,5,4,8,3,7,10,10
"409",-1.9,"Great read!! I rarely give 5 Stars but this book totally deserves it.I loved the plot; a very sad, lonely, drunk, yet sympathetic woman cannot seem to let her ex husband go and move on with her life. She certainly has reason to be angry with him, he dumped her for another woman, but 2 years later she is still obsessed to the point of losing everyone and everything in her life. At times you really feel for her but other times you just want to shake her and tell her to get over it.One drunken night, while she (Rachel), acts on an impulse and decides to show up at her ex husband's house, she finds herself in the middle out of a missing persons investigation.The story is told alternately between the points of view of Rachel, Anna (former mistress, current wife of Rachel's ex) and Megan (missing women).  As the plot unfolds, we find out more about each woman, their lives, histories and motives. We also realize how little people really know about others and how outside impressions can be very deceiving.While reading this book, I didn't really find myself reflecting on the writing style. To me, that means it was written seamlessly for the story. The book was easy to get hooked on, I couldn't put it down once I got started. The ending was not what I had expected. Although  the 'bad guy' was one of several on my list, I really didn't figure it out until very near the end.I highly recommend reading this book. I'd love to hear others thoughts on it.

She shows up at her old house (which is now being lived in by her ex, his new wife and their daughter) and doesn't remember it the next day as she suffers from alcoholic amnesia. She makes up a pretend life for the people that live a few doors down from her old house as she passes them by everyday as she pretends to go to work. She then learns the woman in said house is now missing. She was in the area that night but cannot remember anything because of a blackout. The story then goes on with Rachel trying to fill in the missing pieces that night.This story is told from three different pov. We have Rachel, the amnesiac alcoholic, Anne, the mistress and now wife of Rachel's ex, and Megan, the now missing woman with a lot of secrets. Most of the characters in this book are rather bleak. The only one I found likeable was Rachel's roomate. I think she may be the only sane one in the bunch. This book could be redundant at times with Rachel always drinking but never remember what happened. But she somehow found her way home each time.I give it three stars because it was an okay read.

Rachel was a victim of her own habits, clumsy, dull, needy and relentlessly foolish in her behavior. I simply wanted to shake her and tell her to leave well enough alone, but then of course there would be no story, no conflict.Anna and Megan were shallow, greedy and wanting and taking what wasn't rightfully theirs to take. Megan's wanton nature did her in. Hers was a sad little life that might have turned out better if she had made better choices.Anna's life was a full circle, ""what goes around comes around"" tale.And the men were despicable brutish abusers!Seldom have I disliked so many characters in a novel!I did enjoy the book, but compared to Gone Girl it was a bit disappointing. It was written in the same style.. First one character's narrative, then another's, but the adversaries in Gone Girl were clearly more clever,  more attractive and even more resourceful.Though there were twists and turns, Girl on the Train was plodding in places and I really don't care what Rachel does next!",4,1,3,2,1,8,1,2,13,6

Maybe because Rachel was so sloppy with her drinking and her behavior (and in turn her narration) but it's hard to get behind a character that is so non like-able.  Maybe if there had been more telling about her relationship with Tom in the beginning, so you are able to develop some sympathy for her before you meet her as a black out drunk.  I don't know.*SPOILERS*All that aside, I did spend the whole book trying to formulate who I thought was the culprit, and at one point I was thinking that it could have been Rachel that killed Megan so obviously the plot was well written and spun together.  I had suspicions early on about what was going on with Megan and I was right about those assumptions, but did not expect the end with Anna.So overall, a good read that kept my interest... the comparisons to Gone Girl though really set it up to disappoint some readers I think though.",1,4,2,0,1,3,2,2,6,5

On the train back to her flat, she often begins drinking canned gin and tonics that eventually lead to her alcoholic black outs. She is obsessive about her lost life with her ex-husband, her infertility and a mystical couple who live a few doors down from her previous home.Not only does Rachel observe the back terraces, but she notices clothes and oddities that are discarded by the train tracks below her.As the story unfolds, Hawkins develops each character into deeper, darker aspects of what we first know. Rachel is written to be dark from the beginning, however what the reader doesn't expect is the other characters are equally complex and dark.I highly recommend this book.

The only nice character, Cathy, comes across as a doormat.As the book progresses, it becomes very predictable, which is disappointing. Without divulging too much information about specific characters, I felt at loose ends wondering what happened with some of the remaining characters. The ending was somewhat abrupt, almost as if the author had reached her quoto of pages and decided to call it quits before tying up the loose ends.I did see some style, plot, and character similarities  between this author and Gillian Flynn, however, Flynn's writing is more developed.

It provides great suspense until midway, then it falls flat.  We think we have a complex, scary kind of lady on this train and that she is up to no good. In fact, the plot of the story is way less interesting and the mysterious crackpot isn't.I don't know why Hawkins uses triple narration. It does not move the story forward, in fact, the story doesn't know what direction it's going with this style narration. I kept saying, okay, when is this taking place, and thinking I have a chronology when I don't.Reading this in Kindle is excruciating. In a book, I'd be flipping pages backwards to check on who said what, when, and in regard to whom.

Megan (who is first known as Jess in Rachel's fairy-tail version of people she views from the train window) is mentally unstable with a sordid past.I figured out the ending about two thirds through.

Before killing off the witnesses, the killer sits there and confesses while everyone drinks tea. Then the protagonist plans his/her suspenseful escape (read the book to see if the escape was successful).  Completely predictable plot line with a boringly predictable ending. Totally unrealistic.

I was numb with disbelief when the ""mystery"" was revealed at the end. I couldn't believe the author would pull the most obvious literary trick out of the hat to reveal the murderer. The lead character is in a drunken fugue for most of the book but clarity returns right at the end along with a smug confession by the killer.The key players were a circle of six which included a pathetic drunk, a mistress-turned wife, an adulteress, a serial liar/cheater, a paranoid husband, and a shady therapist...with some random red-haired man thrown in the mix.

The biggest mystery in the book is the heroine's blackouts.  The murder is so banal, without passion and inept that it is literally a crime committed without a trace of motive or evidence.  The heroine, generally in a drunken stupor, has some encounters of interest but mostly stumbles around totally clueless and solves the mystery completely by accident.  The accidental solution to the clueless mystery, finally gives readers a taste of redemption and a glimpse of evil.

The back-and-forth, 3-narrator structure was a bit confusing at first, but I could forgive it because it added a touch more suspense and depth to the story. However, after I finished the last page (and last pizza slice) I found myself a bit hollow. The story had somehow gone from an interesting premise to an ending so formulaic, so obvious, it was, well, ludicrous. I figured out the culprit about halfway through, but I was sure I had to be wrong, that the author just wanted me to think that I knew. And I waited for the twist that never came.

Ms. Hawkins succeeded in churning out a uniquely premised mystery only to muddy it with a Lifetime movie ending.

Rachel has a drinking problem, as you will soon experience in repetitive, unending, mind-numbing detail. And she has a blackout on the night in question which haunts her, because it's during that blackout that Something Happens (that's not a spoiler, it's the whole premise of the book.) Like I said, the set-up is ok, and the stories are involving, but about halfway through you realize that you're only halfway through. What, is there an index at the end that takes up a third of the book? No. I suppose to make the story plod along more ""realistically,"" the author pads the tale with a mountain of repetition (oh did I say that already? Maybe it's contagious!)  — thoughts, conversations, situations, over and over and over. It's funny — the other characters get very tired of Rachel's drama, and you can't help but sympathize. She's just as boring as drunks generally are — so I suppose the author should get credit for accurately portraying a bore.

I figured out the murderer about two-thirds of the way into the book. The ending is nothing short of unbelievable.

"1075",-3.95,"This is a breezy, alternating-first-person suspense story about some seriously troubled lives, with the angle of a murder mystery.  The narrating characters (Rachel, Megan, Anna) unfold through streaming thoughts, scheming and rationalizing and recalling the past, as they take actions affecting each other and the outcome of the story. Rachel, besides her drinking problem, has an almost freakish invasiveness into other people’s lives, showing up at the oddest times and trying to help out, a murder mystery nosiness combined with a serious lack of judgment.  Megan has a lot in her past to be sad and sorry about as she drives irrationally toward finding her truth.  Anna pretty much takes what she can and then begins to resent it.  In a rehash of stereotype, these women’s lives revolve around equally distorted men who attract them, hurt them, or abandon them in one way or another. It’s a sad tale about some sorry lives.However, strangely, it’s also readable and mildly entertaining.  I enjoyed the device of the train, and the story is told in a fast-paced and entertaining style, engaging while oddly detached from any deep exploration of characters.  I hurried through to see the plot unfold, while at the same time I felt a dislike for the characters.  Is this a device or a fatal disconnect between style and substance?Attempting to give the book a chance, I found myself wondering if its appeal is that the author is holding up a mirror to our own flawed selves, if we are to find the answers there.  All the characters are living a lie of some sort.  Maybe it’s a comedy or a tragedy about human failings? We watch Rachel repeat her dependent behaviors and we want her to get a grip as we hope we would, but does she ever, really? Will her friend Cathy ever apply tough love? Will Megan finally find healing through therapy?  Will Anna get past living another’s life?  Is Scott the ultimate control freak?  How many lies will Tom tell?  Is there any redeemable character here?  Is the book a commentary on today’s 30-somethings, in today’s relative freedom to be what you want to be, leading empty, dependent lives, with past losses to blame it on?  Rachel says, “let’s be honest: women are still only really valued for two things— their looks and their role as mothers.”  Really. Is this true or just another lie she tells herself?There are hints of insights, as when Megan reflects upon therapy, “the holes in your life are permanent. You have to grow around them, like tree roots around concrete; you mould yourself through the gaps.”  This sounds deep, and we almost think there could be some character development here.

She rides the train all day to keep her roommate from knowing that she’s now unemployed. Her train happens to pass by the house she once owned with her husband, Tom. Tom is now married to Anna and they live happily in what was once her home. Rachel’s train ride through London is often spent tipping a bottle back. Seeing her old home and sometimes even catching a glimpse of the other woman, is enough to make her drink and drink she does. So much so, that what she sees is often not remembered later.That memory thing becomes a problem early on.Yes. It. Does.Rachel’s daily observances include a couple that she’s come to know as Jess and Jason, names she’s made up to give them substance. She watches them interacting on the balcony of their apartment, and she’s dreamed up a back story for them. But when Jess does something out of character for her, and then a crime is committed, Rachel takes it upon herself to investigate.As you can imagine, things get out of hand. Rachel sticks her nose into their lives and in the process, ends up involving her ex-husband and his wife. Both, really want nothing to do with Rachel but out of obligation, aware of Rachel’s raging alcoholism, Tom tries to look out for her when he can, which infuriates Anna.Tension mounts as the story unfolds and when you get to those last few chapters, you can’t help but turn the kids away, let your dinner burn, etc. The ending needs to be read uninterrupted. Don’t tell me that I didn’t warn you.But, honestly, Rachel’s antics were a little tiring. Just when I started to grow bored with her, some critical piece of info would surface and then I’d be flipping pages again. I suppose that’s a sign of true suspense because there was no way I was going to put the book down. I knew that from the start. Does it deserve the hype? Yes, I think so.

"1267",-1.4,"I haven't read the other 900 reviews. I will just offer my own fresh perspective, unaffected by them. I think this is a fantastic novel. I am an avid reader of the mystery/thriller genre, and I have read so many books that I often have difficulty remembering them a couple of weeks later. For instance, I recently read Cain and Abe. A good novel by a fine writer, but I had to look it up on Amazon just now to remember what it was about. However, I will never forget The Girl on the Train. I would honestly have to say that this is the best piece of fiction that I have read in quite a while. It is totally unique. The premise is that a woman is traveling back and forth on a train to London. The track switching mechanism normally forces the train to pause in a position where the backs of homes on an adjacent street can be seen. The protagonist, Rachel, sees her own ""ex-home"", where her ex-husband currently lives with a new wife, whom he acquired after cheating on Rachel. Nearby, she sees what she believes to be the ""perfect couple"", frequently out on the terrace when the train goes by. Then one day, she sees Mrs. perfect kissing a strange man. The next day, Mr. Perfect's wife goes missing.Now Rachel is a serious alcoholic, and so it is not clear what is real and what is her imagination. She has frequent ""black outs"". I have to say that this author's description of the curse of alcoholism is dead on. You feel for Rachel, but you also disdain her. Why can't she just get her act together? It is all very complicated, and Ms. Hawkins masterfully handles all of that in the novel. I suspect she must know an alcoholic so as to portray their plight so accurately.So who killed Mr. Perfect's wife? And how and why? And was Mr. Perfect actually perfect? These are the questions that are slowly addressed as the novel goes on, with rising tension. Rachel does some really stupid things, but we are rooting for her at every turn. The downtrodden, drunk ex-wife who just wants to interject herself into the lives of a couple she only fantasizes about based on what she has seen outside the window of a train. The train is central to the novel. It gives it form. Every chapter is a date and a time, ""morning"" or ""evening"", coinciding with the commuter train to and from London. It sets the pace of the novel and helps to create tension. It is unique in this respect. It is a voyeur story, initially. And that sucks you into the story.There are a lot of twists and turns in this novel. I guessed who the murderer was at 61% (Kindle), but I couldn't have guessed the final outcome of this excellent novel! I can't recommend this highly enough. This is a MUST READ.",6,8,5,7,6,7,3,6,12,14

However, I'm glad it was a short, fast read because if I had to spend any more time with any of those characters, I was going to shoot myself. These are some of the worst people I've met in a book--or real life, for that matter. The most irritating was the one we spent the most time with, Rachel.  She's not only unlikable, but painfully pathetic.  She's a person with whom I'm very glad I don't relate.  But, for me, having at least a little connection/relation to the main character enhances my enjoyment of a work.  I hated Rachel.  I hated all these people.  I felt no sympathy for any of them, not even the murder victim.  Also, there were several distracting spelling errors (not just British spelling differences, but actual errors) that I couldn't believe were missed by an editor.

"1309",-6.7,"The Girl on the Train is yet another twist on the classic whodunit. The story is told through the point of view of three women, each with their own flaws and secrets. We meet Rachel Watson, a drunk, unemployed, divorcee who daydreams about the ""perfect"" life of Jess and Jason - a couple she only knows by seeing them from the train every day. When Jess (Megan Hipwell) turns up missing, Rachel takes it upon herself to solve the case. Through a series of lies and deceit, Rachel finds herself face to face with a cast of male characters (all deeply flawed themselves), anyone of whom could be the killer.My thoughts on the book:The writing style is just horrendous and completely unnecessary. The entire book is written in first person, though our POV switches between the three female characters: Rachel, Megan, and Anna. This can lead to confusion when the action flips back and forth. Had this use of first person worked to reveal something about the characters that could just not be said through third-person omniscient, it could have worked. But it was complicated by the fact that each chapter was broken into ""Morning"" and ""Evening"", so the tense switched back and forth between present and past tense. I get that breaking it up this way reflects the two train trips, one in to the city, one back home, but it is unnecessary as most of the action takes place off the train. These two combined makes it difficult to read.This is Hawkins' first novel, and it shows. The bland writing style bored me to death, and it took everything I had in me to finish the book. Stephen King can spend 80% of a book writing about nothing and I love every word of it. Hawkins drew out a boring story where we learn to hate every character involved. Not a single character has a good redeeming quality.I was genuinely surprised when the killer was revealed. I was not shocked, however, and this is a huge negative. When I read the reveal in ""Gone Girl"", I had to put the book down. I could not continue because I had to process what I had just read. I have had this happen in many other books. Good fiction is emotional. You feel shocked because you're so invested in the story and characters. Here, I was just glad it was over.Conclusions:I read this book simply because the movie is coming out soon and it was well known and liked. I was disappointed throughout, and expected much more. There are many things (see above) that could have improved this book. The plot was not bad, it was just poorly developed. The characters were not unbelievable, but they sure were unlikable.

"1332",-3.7,"First off, I think there is somewhat of a ""herd"" mentality in the overall negative ratings by some reviewers of this book. With that off my mind...I see real value in the epiphanies each of the three female characters experienced within the unfolding of the story.Rachel literally rides the train and, to my interpretation, is  also, figuratively riding the train of alcoholism leading to some serious self delusion. She blames the failure of her marriage entirely on herself and carries the burden of the resultant guilt. She never saw her husband clearly. While riding the train into London everyday she invests emotional attachment to a young couple she observes in a house she passes everyday...so much so... she bestows upon them her own made-up names. Events in her own life and in the lives she is observing conspire to literally and figuratively make her get off the train. These events are suspenseful and make for a great storyline. Both Anna and Megan each have different self discoveries. The male characters do not seem to evolve and if anything, each one you meet shares culpability in the main event of the book.  Particularly odious to me (and he is written to actually smell bad) is Scott for his hyper aggressive selfish character; his bullying and his assault of Rachel. Just a personal observation and opinion.Careful reading of this book will yield many clever literary devices. The fact that there is not one smile described as genuine from joy at its root in the whole book.""Everything about him is warm—his hands, his eyes, his voice—everything but the smile. You can see the killer in him when he shows his teeth.""Another is the symbolism behind the small pile of rocks in the corner of Megan and Scott's garden.It is not written as an intense suspense narrative with accelerated pacing and should not be compared with such.  It is written more like a jigsaw puzzle with the pieces to the puzzle locked inside the seemingly blackout mind of the ""Girl on the Train"".

Much of the action revolves around Rachel's drunkenness, self-loathing and sad pining over her ex-husband, now happily remarried after an affair and with a new baby. Told very much from a woman's viewpoint, Hawkins uses three separate voices for Rachel, Megan - a girl she knows only from seeing from the train into  London - and Anna, the new wife of her ex, Tom.In some ways, the novel is as much a psychological thriller as it is a murder mystery. Rachel is an anti-hero with rafts of problems, a lamentable lifestyle and an unrequited need - almost at a primal scream level - for a child. The characters are generally well-drawn, though the milieu is very circumscribed and, for Rachel, almost suffocating.The ending (or at least the culprit) is pretty well telegraphed toward the end and comes after Rachel tries repeatedly to recall her actions during a drunken blackout - though how she finally does it isn't truly believable. The Girl on the Train seems almost as though it could be autobiographical, and that's a tribute to Hawkins.

"1471",-3.15,"It’s hard to be objective about a novel that strives so determinedly (and successfully) to make its characters as unlikable as those in Paula Hawkins’ bestselling mystery, “The Girl On the Train”. With not one, but three, unreliable narrators jumping back and forth in time offering first-person perspectives on unfolding events, the book chronicles the intertwined stories of sad-sack drunkard, Rachel, the titular girl on the train; Megan, the secretive blonde half of a seemingly perfect couple Rachel spies on from the train; and Anna, a hard-edged suburbanite who envisions herself as the perfect wife and mother.The central mystery begins when one of the women goes missing.The main narrative, necessarily, comes from Rachel, still wallowing in booze and self-pity years after her husband left her for the younger, prettier Anna. In fact, Anna, the usurper, and Rachel’s ex-husband are still living in the same house that once belonged to Rachel. Having lost her job due to drunkenness, Rachel still takes the train each day from the suburbs into London, not only to make her sober-minded roommate think she’s still gainfully employed, but also to keep an eye on her ex and the woman occupying her old home; the train just happens to pass right by the place. A few doors down lives a beautiful young couple whom Rachel also watches, becoming a little too fascinated by their lives lived largely out in the back yard and through open windows. Although Rachel nicknames them Jess and Jason and envies what she perceives to be their idyllic wedded bliss, it soon becomes apparent that appearances are deceiving, especially after she witnesses a shocking act that shakes up her vicarious fantasy life. But, did she, in fact, see what she thought she saw? Rachel’s reality is blurred from heavy drinking which often results in blackouts; her problems are compounded by her stalking of not only her ex-husband, Tom, and his increasingly agitated wife, but of Scott and Megan, the real-life “lovebirds” Rachel knows as Jess and Jason. What follows is a harrowing, sometimes confusing yarn that allows for no “good guys” and sees Rachel making one misstep after another after another until finally, I lost patience with her to the point that I found it difficult to finish the book. A main character doesn’t necessarily have to be likable, or even relatable, to maintain a good story but they should offer up something—sympathy, grudging admiration, even hatred—to keep the reader hooked in to that character, to want to know what happens to him or her. Rachel used up what sympathy I had for her very quickly, and while I didn’t like her at all, I didn’t dislike her enough by the end to care what happened to her. By the time she finally rallies from her downtrodden hangdog state, it was too little, too late; I simply didn’t care. However, being very familiar with the behavior of alcoholics, I did find Rachel’s behavior to be believable (for the most part), if tiring.The character of Megan was more interesting, and perhaps, more sympathetic. With dark secrets in both her past and present, Megan is a well-structured character who is damaged and self-destructive, not a nice woman but not someone who is intentionally cruel. Her own missteps, more dramatic than Rachel’s (at least early on), are poignant and truly heartbreaking, and while the character of Rachel is the protagonist of the story, it is Megan who really drives it.Anna, the third voice in “Girl On the Train”, is probably the least developed of the three narrators. Presented as a vain, calculating homewrecker whose deeds are doubling back on her, Anna is something of a narcissist, who is, understandably, at the end of her rope with Rachel and her attendant drama. Anna considers herself to be clear-headed and sane compared to the other female characters in the novel, although her narcissism precludes her from seeing that she’s as deluded as they are.The problem I found with having three narrators is that their voices begin to seem strangely similar as one chapter featuring Anna flows into the next chapter, narrated by Rachel, and so on. If Rachel isn’t on a drunken binge, it’s difficult to separate her musings from those of Anna; in more than one instance, I found myself thumbing back to the beginning of a chapter to see if it was titled “Rachel”, “Anna” or “Megan”.The men in the story are also difficult to separate in some instances, and even more sketchily written than Anna. Tom, Anna’s husband and Rachel’s ex, is very much like Scott, Megan’s husband, and neither seems to be all that distinctive. There’s also a shady psychiatrist on hand who doesn’t seem to balk at bedding his patients, and a couple of cops who never come to life, existing merely as words on a page. Of course, they’re an awkward necessity in moving the story forward (and in offending Rachel).Also awkward is the fact that characters narrate events in the present, often simultaneously with a different character in the following chapter, while another character narrates events from months, or years, earlier. Again, it’s a necessity in moving the story forward (and in tying up all the loose ends) but it feels awkward. The solution to the mystery, when it comes, isn’t surprising but it is serviceable and doesn’t insult the reader’s intelligence.As trying as I often felt “The Girl On the Train” to be, it does offer up some suspense, and isn’t altogether horrible.

In addition, the chapters aren’t in chronological order.  So one woman’s narrative is followed in the next chapter by another woman’s narrative from a year earlier.  It was a little confusing at first, but it wasn’t hard to get the hang of it.Rachel, the protagonist, is the most well-developed and interesting character.  In addition, the scenes are sketchy.  But in every other respect, what the writer does for the beginning two-thirds of the book, exhibits a mastery of detail and pacing, particularly in Rachel’s narrative as she makes her way in these urban and suburban settings.  These chapters have fine literary qualities, enticing the reader to continue.However, the writer doesn't smoothly integrate this literary first part of the novel with the overall detective mystery orientation.

She is a person who makes the same decisions to drink, black out, then wakes up confused but knowing she's ""done something bad"".  She phones her ex husband on a regular basis, drunk, crying and/or  harassing he and his wife; she sponges off her roommate who for some reason puts up with her drinking and passing out constantly.  Rachel goes through a repetitious cycle of drinking, blacking out and waking up knowing she has ""done something bad"".  The thing is, she makes the same decisions over and over.  I wanted to personally slap her midway through the story and thereafter.  I nearly stopped reading it several times.I could barely get through this book and the only reason I finished it was to find out what actually happened to the missing woman.

First off, here is the positives:I like the story telling device of switching between points of view, it was really cool, especially when you see a particular situation from a different point of view. It was a compelling story and had aspects of a thriller which made it a page turner. Even though it is a British author and set in London, there aren't too many ""British"" phrases that will make an American have to guess. Only a very few times did I need to look up what a particular phrase meant. I think the author has written a good book.Now for the critical part.(Spoiler free)- Even though the non-linnear story telling was awesome, sometimes it took some rereading to figure out what day it is (or what time it is in some cases)- There are some inconsistencies in details, I can't think of a specific example right now, but it's almost as if the editor didn't do a good job or the author should have been more thorough in her characters back stories and situations.- I thought the device of having Rachel be an alcoholic was interesting and did lend to the story, however, it seemed like Rachel had ""Hollywood Alcoholism"" - broad characteristics, and able to turn it off at a moment. Sure she focuses her energy on something else, but as a person in recovery myself, you (or at least I) couldn't just ""forget to have a drink"" and maybe thats just me, but it seemed odd that she could turn it on and off so frequently.- The biggest of all, however, is the lack of back story for Rachel. (dead father, mommy issues, roommate) All of these influence the type of person she is, yet there is nothing to expand on why she is like she is other than a passing mention.SLIGHT SPOILERS BELOW- The red hair guy serves zero purpose and only confuses things more. I feel like too much time was wasted on that story arc, or rather not enough time was spent to make him an important character. Totally useless, and not even in a red herring sort of way.- Rachel and Scott: Why did they have sex? Again served no purpose to the story and wasnt plausible based on the story telling. The attractive young, recently widowed guy, who had a smoking hot wife, would not have sex with a frumpy, unkept woman. Or if he would there was not a lot to his story.- Kamal - I feel like he got put ""on the bus to Mandyville"" (look up the trope if you dont know what it means).- Also, the detectives investigating the murder are the stupidest characters ever written. Its kind of like the detectives were from an unpublished comedy novel that happened to fall into this manuscript.- Finally, without a major spoiler... the ""who-done-it"" reveal was too much of ""the butler did it"" and it came out of left field. All of sudden we were at the end and the murderer is revealed and it doesnt really make sense other than ""of course!"" - which is not a way a thriller should end.",5,7,5,3,5,6,6,8,12,16

As none of the male characters have a section where we hear their voices narrating, they immediately become suspects of the murder. About two thirds of the way through I figure out the killer.  The book could have been edited to make it about 100 pages shorter.

"1730",-2.05,"Hawkins has a good painterly sense of language, and the first part of the novel in particular is lullingly lyrical, exactly as it should be, pulling you into the book's deliberate confusion of reality and imagined reality. However, the plot doesn't hold up to this promise, and the revelations at the end about one particular character had me rolling my eyes. Yes, there are awful people in the world, selfish ones, puerile ones, and astoundingly shallow ones... but the Hannibal Lecter of this book suffers from real two-dimensionality, if not one-. None of the characters here are particularly admirable, frankly, which may be part of the point - the frailties of real folk versus their idealizations - but the result for me was less a sense of disturbance at how evil often wears an everyday face, and more a disappointment regarding how much more this book could have explored that truth. It's just too romanticized to really hit home the way a book like this has to, to have staying power. It never socks you in the gut the way it needs to, the way, for instance, that Girl with the Dragon Tattoo does repeatedly, until I had to put the book down for a bit and remind myself that people are just as often saints as monsters. It never, frankly, really sobers up. I'm sure some readers will violently disagree with me on that last point, but I just never got a sense of things becoming truly concrete in the jarring, almost dislocating way that one has when waking abruptly - or more appropriately, being smacked awake. This sort of tale requires a violent stripping away of the haze, a palpable jolt, a sudden, horrible realization that one has been pied-pipered into the river, has in fact been drowning for a while, and is now almost out of air. But my reaction to the ""big reveal"" was more ""Oh, for cripes sake, that's really it?""Granted, that was my reaction to the end of Da Vinci Code as well. Both that book and Girl on the Train have promising premises they don't deliver on. Our main character in this book is, tellingly, a *girl,* despite being a grown woman - and I'm not sure she's not still a girl at the end, or at least how much less of one she's really become.",11,2,8,10,4,6,6,6,14,13

"1841",-5.65,"Rachel Watson is a down-on-her-luck young woman who rides the train in and out of London every day to hide the fact that she has lost her job from her roommate, and to maintain a tenuous link to what she once was: gainfully employed, happily married and sober. One particular house near the railway tracks fosters an increasingly unhealthy obesssion in Rachel on these daily trips, with its seemingly perfect couple who sit on the terrace. Is it a secret longing for what Rachel once had? Or something more forbidding, something on her own emotional doorstep?With its Hitchcock like setup and close similarity to Gillian Flynn’s work, ‘Girl on a Train’ opens with this compelling story question. Then Rachel’s blurred recollection of a crime she witnesses in a drunken stupor causes her to stumble through the lives of others, wreaking havoc on ex-neighbors, her ex-husband, and aggravating the police, who soon lose patience with Rachel’s drinking and lies. You may actually find yourself doing the same as she keeps hitting the bottle.But ultimately ‘Girl on a Train’ disappoints. It just can’t live up to its promising start.If ever there was an unreliable narrator, it’s Rachel.And this is part of the book’s problem: The reader is too often misled into feeling one way about a character, only to have it not be so. The mystery itself relies too heavily upon Rachel’s opportune blackouts, taking us to the edge of discovery only to learn that she just can’t quite remember what happened. Until she does. And then the murderer does something so dumb (keeping a key piece of evidence any killer worth their salt would surely have gotten rid of) that it violates the ‘maximum capacity’ rule of a worthy villain. He/she also manages to give the clichéd, expository summing up toward the end of the book, explaining in detail the crimes committed and the motives for committing them.Like Gillian Flynn’s books, the parallel to ‘Girl on a Train’ is apparent: multiple narrators switching back and forth in first person as the crime unravels, everyday people living lives of quiet desperation, marriages that appear to be perfect but aren’t. But whereas Flynn’s writing can soar, and her characters are rich and nuanced, Paula Hawkins’ prose is deliberate and too ordinary to make us want to spend so much time in her character’s heads. There are clarity issues in the story telling as well, not helped by the fact that all three narrators are young English women of the same age, same class, with similar backgrounds and voices.Girl on a train is a solid suspense read however, although mystery buffs will find themselves want more.",7,12,5,12,6,9,6,10,19,23

I don't mean that as a bad thing, though. I thoroughly enjoyed reading a book where I felt like I was my own detective, trying to solve a mystery where I couldn't even trust the narrators. There was some type of a plot twist around every corner, and in the end, I was very much satisfied by the climax and conclusion Hawkins created. (I'll add a quick caveat here that there was one part of the story towards the end about one of the character's backgrounds that is so quickly explained, that it felt like an afterthought thrown in for necessity, but not development--that was disappointing).The only major complaint I had about this book was that so much of it felt unoriginal and cliche to me. The characters were somewhat dull: Rachel is an alcoholic, Megan is a restless obsessive, and Anna is a narcissist. But very little of each of these character's traits were developed further. And the men in this book were so black-and-white that I sort of pity any man who reads this book because the stereotypes are so plain to see--the men are either doting, kind-hearted lovers or oppressive, jealous villains.But then again, maybe these cliches were exactly Hawkins point--to make the setting and characters so ordinary that it made the story just that more chilling.",5,4,4,2,5,7,3,5,8,8

She rides the train to and from London everyday, caught up in her thoughts and swimming in the aftereffects of a night of drinking.

The ex-wife, Rachel, devastated by the breakup, is reduced to alchoholism and emotional instability. She drunkenly harrasses her ex-husband and his new wife, and dreams of what might have been as she passes her former neighborhood on her train commute.  She becomes fixated on another couple in that neighborhood that she glimpses on these trips.  One morning she witnesses the woman with a different man, and her illusion of the perfect couple she had in her head is shattered.  She becomes even more disturbed when the woman, named Megan, disappears without a trace.  Determined to find out what happened, she inserts herself into the investigation by reporting what she saw to the police.

The reason she is looking towards this road is because her ex-husband lives there - in her marital home - with his new wife and their baby. To distract herself from her husband's new family, Rachel broods nostalgically over the seemingly perfect couple down the road, until she discovers they are not perfect either.  Then the wife (Megan) disappears and Rachel is convinced she has evidence to tell the police.  But will they believe an unstable obsessive woman whose only knowledge of the case comes through glimpses from the train?As Rachel grapples with her own demons and tries to solve the mystery of Megan's disappearance, she makes some self-destructive decisions - meanwhile, the reader learns more about Megan through her own first-person narration, and also Anna who is now married to Rachel's ex-husband.  Rachel, Megan and Anna all have their own flaws, darkness, vanities and fragility, which draw them unwittingly together into a destructive bond.The information about each character is revealed slowly and logically, as all the interweaving relationships become more complex and transparent.

They all do awful things and are general a-holes. Still, you can't help but look at them and wonder if you see pieces of yourself in them. Have you ever cheated on someone? Been cheated on? Lied? Been a little too violent in an argument with a SO? Drunk-dialed/texted an ex, over and over, or just embarrassed yourself by being able to let go? Made a fool of yourself? Came to work hung over and useless? It's a good read, for sure. I'm sure reviewers like to use words like ""unflinching"" to describe it.I personally just enjoy books with characters that beat back the stereotypes. Rachel totally did that. She's overweight and totally makes a fool of herself repeatedly. You're disgusted by her weakness, and yet if you've ever been in a relationship, especially one that ended poorly, you can probably feel a glimmer of understanding.Hollywood will undoubtedly make this into an unrecognizable mess.

I rarely give 5 Stars but this book totally deserves it.I loved the plot; a very sad, lonely, drunk, yet sympathetic woman cannot seem to let her ex husband go and move on with her life. She certainly has reason to be angry with him, he dumped her for another woman, but 2 years later she is still obsessed to the point of losing everyone and everything in her life. At times you really feel for her but other times you just want to shake her and tell her to get over it.One drunken night, while she (Rachel), acts on an impulse and decides to show up at her ex husband's house, she finds herself in the middle out of a missing persons investigation.The story is told alternately between the points of view of Rachel, Anna (former mistress, current wife of Rachel's ex) and Megan (missing women).  As the plot unfolds, we find out more about each woman, their lives, histories and motives. We also realize how little people really know about others and how outside impressions can be very deceiving.While reading this book, I didn't really find myself reflecting on the writing style. To me, that means it was written seamlessly for the story. The book was easy to get hooked on, I couldn't put it down once I got started. The ending was not what I had expected. Although  the 'bad guy' was one of several on my list, I really didn't figure it out until very near the end.I highly recommend reading this book. I'd love to hear others thoughts on it.

That doesn't bother me, as I like novels that have interesting character development.  I did think most of the characters and many of the events were unrealistic and over the top, but that is true of many novels. Think of science fiction and fantasy novels, for example.Rachel, the main character was an alcoholic and I kept hoping she would straighten up and quit drinking.  Much of the time I just wanted to shake her for making repeated poor decisions.  Her ex-husband Tom had left her for Anna.  They had a baby, something Rachel had not been able to do.  Anna and Tom seemed to be happy, but then he was cheating with Megan whom he hired to be a babysitter.  The story is told in alternating chapters by these three women.As I said, the novel kept me reading and wanting to know what would happen next.  I kept trying to figure out who was a reliable narrator and who committed the murder.  It was well written too. I guessed who the murderer was after reading about 80% of the book, but I occasionally thought I might be wrong.Even though I liked it a lot, it is not a book that I'm likely to remember a few years from now, perhaps because several of the situations seemed contrived.",2,5,3,2,2,4,1,5,8,8

However, the interconnections of implausibly self-absorbed, ill or evil people just did not appeal to me. Nor did the author's technique of switching voices between the women and moving about the timeline of their parts.

Paula Hawkins has done a wonderful job of creating characters who the reader may not necessarily like, but who's stories draw us in. The mystery is well kept up until the last few chapters, though it does conclude with plenty of questions still unanswered.

Rachel was a victim of her own habits, clumsy, dull, needy and relentlessly foolish in her behavior.

Megan's wanton nature did her in.

I did't know at the time it was autobiographical, as well as the heroine's struggle against alcoholism. Those are the best parts of the book, and the introspective parts are by far the best part of the book. The suspense/mystery part is not as good. I already suspected the end half way through the book and keep reading just for confirmation. I can't say it's a bad book, but I don't understand its cult status. Some people compare it to Lost Girl, and although the plot has nothing to do with it, I understand the comparison.

I never was able to sympathize or identify with any of the characters.  They were all significantly flawed; I could not understand the motivation of any of the three women--they each found a way to manufacture their own dismal destiny without finding a way out of the mess.  They each allowed themselves to be manipulated by the males in the story; are women really as desperate as this??I also thought that the plot was bogged down by repetitive reflections.  How many times can we go to the ""underpass"" without becoming suspect of the events?  Once it was established that Anna was not available in the scene, the predictability of  the final event was obvious.I kept wanting at least one of the characters to be redeemable . . . someone whom I could feel controlled his/her own outcome.

"2215",-5.3,"www.melissa413readsalot.blogspot.comWhere do I even begin about this book! I loved it of course as I have rated it 5 stars. This was a complex journey through the lives of people that seem so normal from the outside. But things are never what they seem.THERE WILL BE SOME SPOILERS AFTER THIS POINT!!!The book is told through three different lives: Rachel, Megan and Anna. Rachel seems to be the alcoholic loser that can't get over her husband Tom leaving her. I feel very sorry for Rachel. All she wanted was to have a child with her husband. Because she wasn't able to conceive she went into a deep depression which turned her into an alcoholic. Her husband Tom was an a..hole who wouldn't help her in any way. He could have tried all kinds of counseling with her, but he leaves her. Of course this doesn't help with her drinking. She is just a sad person living with a woman named Cathy and trying to get by. She just can't cope over not having a child and losing her husband. It's been two years and she's just lost and drinking so much that she loses her job. But instead of telling Cathy this, she still rides the train every morning and evening, pretending she still has a job. This train just happens to go by her old house and she watches her ex husband with his new wife and baby. She also watches another couple a few houses down. She makes up names for them and dreams of their perfect life. It's a little bizarre, but so is life.The name of the couple in the house down from Rachel's old house is Megan and Scott. They are not the happy couple Rachel dreams they are. Megan is not happy with Scott and is having an affair. Scott is a bit of a control freak and scary.Rachel is always calling her ex trying to get him to come back to her. She shows up at their house sometimes. Just crazy things she does when she is drunk. One night she goes out there to see him but is so drunk she can't remember much of anything that happened. She knows she finds her way home with blood on her and that a man helped her up when she fell to the ground. She finds out the next day that Megan is missing. This takes us on a wild ride of Rachel trying to find out what happened to Megan. She was there that night where Megan was last seen. She wonders if she did something to her or if she saw someone that did. She blacked out and can't remember much at all.Rachel gets caught up in trying to find out this mystery. She stops calling and bothering her ex husband Tom as much since she's got something else to worry about. This makes Anna, Tom's wife, happier but she still has stress and hatred for Rachel.I have to say I didn't like Anna at all through the whole book! I thought she was a horrible person. When finding out she was having an affair with Rachel's husband the whole time just confirmed it. Then she eventually marries him. But not all is wonderful in this little world of people.Rachel befriends Megan's husband Scott trying to find out what is going on and help him with his pain. She told him Megan was seeing another man, her therapist. She's trying to keep the police from thinking he did it.The whole book has you wondering if Rachel might have killed Megan thinking she was Anna since they look similar in appearance. But then things start to fall into place and it's a dramatic ending that I didn't see coming. I loved the ending. I just loved it. Justice was done for all involved, in a sense.I loved this book and I hope to read more from this author. She did an awesome job!",6,11,2,8,7,11,5,9,17,13

"2218",-1.65,"The Girl on the Train belongs to the category of trashy mega-bestsellers of the Gone Girl caliber. The “girls” in both titles are my age but the titles are not imprecise. These are not Bildungsromane. The adult protagonists live the results of the female development that pursues infantilization. The three female narrators of The Girl on the Train are not just infantilized. They are infants. These women refuse to reach at least the toddler stage and learn to form and retain memories. Their helplessness and neediness can only be compared to that of an infant. And the symbolic mother from whom they demand constant nourishment and comfort is, obviously, a man.Men are needed to mother the infant-women but, at the same time, they are an object of intense rage and resentment if they fail to bring the nourishing tit to the screaming infant-wife the second she demands it. The men are all-powerful, mysterious forces who sometimes choose to torture the infants by keeping the crucial tit away. This process could not be more similar to the psychoanalytic description of the relationship between an infant and his mother’s breast. And, of course, the consequences of the breast staying away for too long are the predictable oral-stage traumas.As trashy and devoid of any artistic merit as they are, these bestsellers are an important cultural phenomenon. The moribund Gender Studies programs could be reinvigorated if they started with a course on what actual women actually read, talk and care about so massively. There is absolutely nothing in today’s gender theory that would even remotely try to address the issues that preoccupy women today. Feminist theory (theory, not practice) has grown completely irrelevant to the majority of women. These bestsellers that I keep reading – in spite of their long-windedness, poor quality, and extraordinary repetitiveness – are enormously more valuable than the mountains of recent publications on gender that I study for work.I can’t give The Girl on the Train more than 3 stars because the author is inexperienced, clumsy, and drags things out like’s she’s paid by the word.

I am sympathetic to addiction, but Rachel's alcoholism felt totally contrived -- it was as if the author just used it as a way to present holes in the story because it was written like how a teenager (or someone who has never drank) would probably perceive it to be. All the characters were pathetic, two dimensional and unbelievable and it read like a never ending daytime soap opera or Lifetime movie. If you're really that interested in solving the mystery just read a spoiler review and be done with it. Wish I had done that instead of wasting my time.

Apart from aspects of Scott, I could not feel the empathy a reader should have with at least one or two characters. Rachel, the alcoholic, is one of those women who seem to moan and whine and irritate people. She irritated me, and her frequent and total blackouts after binge drinking were not always convincing. Anna is such a typical weak and clingy type -- but at the very end she's suddenly this amazingly strong woman just when the reader expects her to fall apart. Megan's psychiatrist remains a very vague figure, as does Megan herself. In fact, Megan is the least convincing character.But hey, there's a murder ...nuff said, I don't want to spoil the book for you.

Infidelity and sexual adventurism remain punishable by death (for women only). This story's twists and characterizations are so broad and archetypical that it could be told in pantomime.

Rachel fantasizes about the people she sees and then - as she bottoms out - drinking alcohol, losing her husband, losing her job, she is thrust into the reality of those she has been watching.  The descriptions of her late night walks, her black-outs, her pleas for help - meander down dark paths and emerge in an unanticipated place.  The beginning of the book made me think of Hitchcock - but then it took some unexpected turns.  I'm not entirely sure how I feel about the ending - having just finished it at 3:00 in the morning - not being able to put it down when I should have been sleeping.

There are twists and turns and though I did figure out who the killer was and why, it was still exciting and even more twisty than I imagined.Truly, I don't understand all the negative reviews but so many seem to be based on the characters' personalities and weaknesses. I'm sorry but this is a murder mystery filled with flawed people which is truly realistic. What were readers expecting? Heroes and perfect, moral characters? How boring would that be as well as unrealistic. So many main characters in literature are flawed, imperfect, weak, tragic, and broken. It's sad that so many people think a character who was abused or who has a drinking problem isn't work reading about or listening to. Each character in this book has their flaws which come out here and there throughout the book, making you realize that what you thought you knew, you didn't know at all. It's also incredible to me that the same people who complained about the flawed characters were also offended by the comparison to ""Gone Girl.""

"4197",-13,"This is a story of nasty dudes and naive women. I loved it. It’s being compared to Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, but that’s not a good comparison. They are both amazing in their own ways and for very different reasons. This book has so many questions that have to be answered. Is Megan dead or did she run away? Both are plausible. Why is Rachel so obsessed with her? Is it just her imagination? Why is Tom so passive of Rachel’s constant intrusions? Who is sleeping with who? Does Anna have any redeeming qualities?The characters are flawed and some are downright detestable. The story focuses on three women: Rachel, the drunk who can’t let go of her ex-husband, Anna, the one who stole him away, and Megan, the beautiful missing woman.Rachel was a great character to read. She is completely broken and her only escape is with alcohol. The story is told from first-person perspective and doesn’t have a whole lot of dialogue, so her chapters were desperate and lonely. I could put myself in her shoes. She is someone who is easy to pity, as she travels the train everyday, pretending to go to a job that she was fired from months ago. Every day she looks at a house, only a few down from where she once lived, and watches a loving couple. She creates a make-believe world around them, perfect in every way. It’s an obvious set-up for disappointment.Anna is not likeable. At no point in the book did I feel anything for her but contempt. She knowingly begins an affair with a married man, none other than Rachel’s husband Tom, and effectively steals him away. Granted, Rachel’s depression makes it easy for her. At one point, while she’s admiring her and Tom’s sleeping baby, she remembers the days of sneaking around with him and admits that she misses being a mistress. She loved the sense of danger and wishes she could go back to it. All she feels towards Rachel is disgust. She was a good chunk of the book and suffice it to say that her chapters filled me with my own sense of disgust, aimed at her.Next is Megan, the one I’m not sure how to feel about. Partly, she reminds me of Anna, with her “I don’t care about anyone but me” attitude, but she also reminds me of Rachel, with her struggle against depression and insomnia. Her tragic past is the only part of her character that I could stand, as the rest of the time she’s thinking purely about herself and her memories of when she ran an art gallery and had men drooling over her. Surely, she would be appalled to be compared to Rachel, who is described as being overweight, drunk, and repulsive. Megan’s selfishness is sometimes nauseating, but then a wee bit of humanity shines through. Ultimately, I felt sorry for her, but I didn’t like her.The men in the story are a puzzle. There’s good and bad. It’s a confusing mess and I wasn’t always sure which man I was reading about through these women’s thoughts. Have no fear, the book did not leave me with a total sense of hopelessness concerning men in general, even though the author did not show them in a positive light.It’s definitely a mystery. I had inklings all the way through, but it wasn’t until about seventy percent through that I said, “Ah-ha!” I’m always impressed with a book that can keep me guessing more than halfway through and this one definitely did. It wasn’t a huge surprise to me, but it was an unpleasant one. In the beginning, everything is up in the air. No one is safe from doubt, not even poor Rachel. Nothing is completely settled until the very end, as it should be, leading to a perfectly short and powerful climax.The end was fulfilling, yet a little disappointing. I do not like happy-happy endings, but this one lacked hope. It was hinted at, but only one of these women gets to speak and her thoughts are still terrified and troubled. I would have liked to see more resolution for her. As it was, it felt sort of incomplete. My takeaway is that everyone lives in their own distorted version of reality and when the truth shows up it can have devastating repurcussions. So, don’t lie and don ‘t cheat.For the rating:Genre and general reading age – it’s a mystery and thriller. Reading age is adult, due to some really difficult scenes and references, including excessive drinking by more than one of the characters. Sometimes I wondered how they were able to stand up.The level of sexuality – for the amount of cheating involved, it was surprisingly mild. There weren’t actual sex scenes, but memories of trysts and a morning after.Was there graphic language? Not much.Did I cry? Nope.Is it part of a series? Nope.Level of character development was very high. Out of the three men and three women who make up the story, only one was a bit weak. The others were strong and I could see them in my mind.Did I laugh? Nope.This was a fantastically-written story and once I picked it up I couldn’t put it down, literally. I stayed up late into the night with this one. I’m happy to give it <U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F>.5 stars. It was almost perfect.",16,14,15,19,15,22,9,25,36,33
